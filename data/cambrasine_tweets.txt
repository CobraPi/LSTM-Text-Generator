I want more stamps but idk if I should or not ahhh. don't feel bad my brother once cut his finger on a bagel. Not while cutting a bagel --- /on/ a bagel. Yes! +every once in a while they'll say the wrong characters name +when you hand them the one they said they're like wtf is this. Omg my moms tellin me her con gripes+one is how the customer will assume she doesn't know the character names so they describe them instead. right! Sometimes they literally can't vocalize it and I'm like do you know the character??? Or show?? Or COLOR? Throw me a bone. sometimes I just pull out my button case for them and I'm like here NOW you can point. eeeep!!! They do it for everything - prints buttons charms - Like yo the display is facing /you/ for a reason ! prints are bad tho bc if they really can't say it I'm  poking my head out+looking up at an insane angle+it's still hard to tell. it looks soooo amazing, you should be confident !! Nerve pain Renaissance ... No thanks. Say No to Naps. Eep yeah I'd also like to know if there'll be a July order? I kinda want more stamps but I haven't taken em to a con yet...hmm. Hi, I'd like to file a formal complaint.

I only do it when I nap??? It's weird???? yep!! nothing's different except the clenching!! mm I hear that.. I was just inexplicably exhausted today? I was out in the sun for like 5 hours yesterday...maybe I'm just really weak? orz. Sometimes I feel like I'm the only one who knows how to use eBay? I want this thing + 3 people have bid. at least two of them don't seem to understand you bid more than the min and it'll keep. bumpin' u up until it exceeds that amount. Also there's like 12 hours left why u bidding so early..I'm that 15s snipe dbag :|. wish there was a chat where I could tell them 2 chill..like 2 other people bid + you think they won't check in in 12 hours?? PEOPLE NEED TO EDUCATE THEMSELVES!! I mean don't or I won't win but yeah. They just keep bumping up the price for nothing yknow. control its yourselves people!! Signed, the Daughter of a woman mildly addicted to buying beanie babies on eBay in the 90s. whispers programmable...snipe? Now I feel dumb. Can't say I love the thrill of "it's loading.it's loading" after hitting place bid. we are truly privileged children . @ getmeds  The stamps are still on the front page but the info on the product page is April/isn't open.Did you decide against stamps for June? there's lots of different shapes and lengths of dresses :0 You just have to find which ones suit you?

Ack there's a ship I like but if I look in the tags it's just like a barrage of posts telling me I'm a terrible person. meep you're right! I'm not sure where to go for content otherwise .. It's 2016 and yet I'm new to Twitter@u@;. someone literally reserved the url of the ship name and wrote "I hate this ship and I don't want anyone to have it". yeah!!! Twitter is nice!! Because of it I've been able to make connections and have little chats with artists I admire !! So I dreamt about an old friend that I haven't thought about in a while. When I woke up, she had liked my post on fb and anyway I'm psychic. @ getmeds  Hey there! I e-mailed you about a lil problem with my order~ It's fine if you just haven't seen it yet, just letting you know u vu. ahh if you have leftovers after your con, please do put them up!! I'd love one!! Would you ship internationally? (US). /grabby hands. Meep! the employee saw me fighting myself and being skittish about whether to get a succulent and he made them 1.00 and .50 for me bless u. treat yo self. that's so classic. It looks nice tho!! You could use it for pencil bags or smth !! Ahh the colors of this are nice.. https:// twitter.com/mim_mon/status /745338026637746176   …. I've applied to three. We are hopeless. OK I'm doing it, I'm reading more of the bnha manga (only@chapter 46 freakin' slow poke). I....I'm... pic.twitter.com/4ivkihToFu. PHEWWW ok through the hero killer arc I'm just gonna...put this down.......................it's 4 am.  I do kinda miss deku's bow tie (from that official art, even if this isn't based on that really) rip lovin todos hair yo. !! I know, I just think it suits him. They're lookin' hella classy here instead tho . ooooooooof that is one hell of a fuck up yikes... praying 4 u   ganbare. I can only imagine what happened to prompt this tweet. no prob! they're lookin good!! I bet the Voltron ones gonna be super cute! . People keep requesting commissions and when I accept they disappear and it's starting to give me a complex . more like still. I sent a follow up email a couple days ago and it's just like mmmm nothing. I'm just still thinking about it lol. Hmm There were these helpful guides but I didn't see anything quite like these on my nature walk .. pic.twitter.com/0ExSMnVNfg. YLIA is some good shit . omg that's rough.. I dreamt that I was seated next to Bakugou + we were being loud so we got in trouble even tho I'm quiet+anxious. maybe smol todoroki just needs some time to warm up to you. heh yeah but I'm too straight laced so it was actually kinda stressful? ahah aww, I'll pray w u . Ahhhh international packages are so stressful since the tracking numbers almost never work at first... I'm a worry wart. ahhh sorry I hit reply before the rest!! Omg .. even if they hadn't read that I can't believe they didn't /try/ peeling it.. eep so accusatory right off the bat!! . lmfao I hope you get an apology or at least a "whoops". amazing. Both of you. WELL IT'S A LITTLE LATE NOW ISN'T IT pic.twitter.com/o6Ks1Zj4LP. I haven't had Chinese food in like 3 months, we went hard and have lots of leftovers . shamed by a piece of paper ... I feel you. The other day I realized one of mine was too old for me when I watched the show and too young for me now rip. I thought I read he was 22 but I also have no source@u@;;. Me@my sinuses: stop being such a dick. for real it's not even height allergy season or anything it just like spontaneously combusts every once in a while. woahhh! That's really nice * U* congrats! I am such a brat. Idk why but the post office, supermarket, and office supply store all drive me borderline insane and I just went to all 3. If you like FE check out this zine -- I got a lil sneak peek and the art is fantastic!! And proceeds go to charity! https:// twitter.com/disceel/status /744584598961684481   …. (whispers) I ....don't like Iida very much. It's not that I dislike him - I guess I just have a lot of children in this series so he gets knocked down too many spots . PFTT I wish bc she is so good and pure but she's third...after Deku + my problematic son, whom I can't decide between. also..drawing glasses is a pain... THE TRUTH REVEALED: INADEQUATE DRAWING SKILLS REAL REASON FOR FEELINGS ON IIDA TENYA. but seriously hrngh so many cuties...I like Kirishima a lot too and Todoroki is growing on me ~. YES HE IS A GOOD BOY He's a good friend. OHHH I FORGOT HER she's great too ahhhhhh see  too many kids. Ughhh that was like a dozen chapters of non-stop stress...it was good!! But .... Phew... I ....like toga too much ... pic.twitter.com/7YBscZAIzC. I read a bunch of violent/stressful manga before bed and then had the most relaxing sleep in so long---???? I FELL BACK ASLEEP AND SLEPT TIL TWO SHBDKDNNSKSN ... I've been sleeping really poorly lately tho so maybe I just needed it but still, damn. just when you thought Bakugou was my problematic fave.. It was finally cool enough to bike today ~ . yea but look at those buns. asdfk for real, this series is just jam-packed with cuties. I AM OFFICIALLY ALL CAUGHT UP ON THE MANGA where's my gold star. blushy blushy blush ehehe https:// twitter.com/tinfcomic/stat us/747927038317694976   …. Here you go kids pic.twitter.com/BNwBUS8U9p. damn, that's a good idea... !!! So similar to mine! My dog sneezed on my face . YOU SHOULD READ IT seriously it's one of the best manga I've read in..maybe ever.................read it /peer pressures u. he is so good <333. I like Todoroki -- he's not my fave but he HAS HIS MOMENTS FOR SURE <33 he's a good boy too  https:// twitter.com/avyeaa/status/ 746300587457810432   …. yeah!! It gets more intense but it's good!! I think I skipped vol 1 which went through the first couple eps of the anime. I read from ch 45-96 the past 2 days.......it's really addictive!! There's a good balance of school life+challenges+CHAOS. yeah the art is really nice!! The arc after where the anime leaves off is the sports festival and that's a fun one!! :). COUGH he humors me.I could prob get him to but tbh neither of us is built to fill it out   he's fit but he's SLENDER lucky bastard. yes! You def get more of the side charas/interactions in the manga. I WAS EXCITED FOR THE MALL TOO but   I won't spoil ya! yeah!! I'm excited to see it animated! Lots of good stuff there, I think it's a really popular/fave arc. ( I just wanted to see a cute montage of everyone shopping together and that's not how it goes   ). MOSTLY     damn tho that manga is some good shit . I was excited bc they were building some kind of new food place and then ITS A DUNKIN DONUTS WE ALREADY HAVE FIVE IN THIS TOWN UNBELIEVABLE. right? I haven't felt so invested in a series in ...a long time. It's not like that orz Ahhh I know I saw a handful of spoilers but nothing too bad bc even if I knew what happened I was. like OK how do we possibly get from point A to point B so it's still exciting! @ the people who didn't put a house number in their shipping address..do u live on the whole street..what are you doing with your life. !! You should ask your doc about getting Ondansetron, it's some good shit   feel better! . mm!! it's like a dissolvable tablet. they usually give it to people who just came out of anesthesia so they don't puke :P. I ended up w/ some for a bad stomach bug that landed me in the hospital but I get nauseous w/migraines so they refilled :). omg /pats u No prob! I've never had trouble for renewing so I don't think it should be hard to get but I'm not 100% sure. ohh no that was like 2 years ago!! I've recovered ahahah.

I need help (For reference I have made only two whole purchases bc I am poor and indecisive). please feel free to make my life harder by linking me to any good shit you find / make . it was some preliminary thing where artists who were there this year got first dibs at tables. I think real sign ups are dec/jan. sfdndllfn it's frustrating. But I think there may be a limit on it bc I saw a few people say that the two table option sold out. asjfldls I kinda wanna go but it's so far..airfare..also it's hard to gauge how good sales were bc all I read about is the AC . Part of me wants to attend Connecticon for a day but I'm still so sour about the AA. Also neither of my boys will be home to take me . Kirishima is a good boy <333 5 done of 7+ rip me pic.twitter.com/YrvKf2GuWQ.

Omg my Airbnb host for Otakuthon wrote a short novel abt the place but it's so detailed + thorough it's soothing for anxiety. I'm in love??? She even wrote about specific restaurants she likes, which buses to take, and 5 emergency contacts.. for real I've seen incredibly creative fan art! I read "fan art is like junk food" + it's like uh I don't just magic this up yknow. I just read someone wrote "fan art is to junk food what original art is to fine dining" it was so elitist yeesh. this is an amazing development omg. Suck it. Jynx isn't my strongest but I got bigger fish to fry with my Snorlax back home --- pic.twitter.com/pJipS4X9rC. holy shit. @ AOM1NE  who's a good boy??? Who's a good pup??

Deku will be a precious addition to my bnha itabag u vu pic.twitter.com/ClgXzhinxt. "....Are you gonna finish that?" pic.twitter.com/X6PyNk1Ngt. Five minutes into zine hell and I already injured myself whoops. HOLY SHIT IT REALLY SWELLED UP JESUS. did I...break it.... I'm giving my mom shit now bc she was being condescending about it so I didn't ice it right away :|||||. YESSSS this guy is v nostalgic for me pic.twitter.com/SbH90lThpq. Aaaaa I'm at a restaurant that's a pokestop and I wanna lure but servers busy ugh. I think his hair is cute when it's down :0. I got a lot done tonight but also really nothing .. pic.twitter.com/5692gV8mzI. Zine Only are mostly done, bundlin' some bundles. and by some I mean like 300. Got my bf playing Pokemon Go ! I wish we could play together but it's not an option yet :(. I can't believe I'm still the leader of one of my local gyms   It's a popular spot so they change teams constantly. @ my migraine that didn't go away with sleep, meds, food, or ice: what shit are u tryna pull, huh? ahh no problem!! I'm glad you like em! Thank you so much for your patience ; u;   Enjoy~~. Making decisions is hard...and this is so inconsequential too I just can't decide aaa. Shoutout 2 Paypal for realizing I wasn't logging in on Safari and from across the country. I moved the charity zine money but omg.. HSKDNKWKS I got my bf to start Pokemon GO last night and he sent me lots of cute videos of him playing and meeting new people !!! I'm so jealous tho I wanna train with him waaaahhh   Pokemon go - you gotta make a way to play long distance ! also...he's playing w his cute female coworker so I'm extra jealous rip . I WILL WIN HIS HEART .... WITH THE HELP OF MY TRUSTY FLAREON lmfao I wonder what team she's on ..   hm. FUCDKRDG even kirishima's clock has buff arms on it I don't even know what to do with this information. I want it. ...well, that's my boy pic.twitter.com/9xRhSgyJeW. mm you should prob do momo but..dabi.. About costs - I've seen a couple people make a single charm w a few of the villains on it. omg yesss (whispers) please do toga or shinsou !  . there's this guy I used to be bfs w but I cannot parse what he says now..feels like I'm reading Shakespeare , his speech is so confusing ??? Gonna get some felt to make my itabag insert! It's too hard to see clear charms on black and it seems like it'll be easier to attach  things. She's beautiful. I'll name her Hagakure  pic.twitter.com/p8vo6guGKU. I... accidentally lined it all mostly one one layer........oops...................... not on my game tonight :'). Mmmm there's a lure at the library (<10 min walk) but idk when it was put up so idk whether to get off my butt or not. Yeeee Agawam Diner is a pokestop   if only I had a lure rip. I think it was like $7 last year orz so yeah when they changed I didn't notice and took a loss on an order cause it was my bad. oh!! That's exciting!! . sdftgyhjkl this is so precious. he's beauty, he's grace.. AMAZING!!!! !!! :O so excited to see it finished!! hah..ha...silly Juls -- that's not how tag works! .... ha..ha....he...lp. "Oh shit, I'm out of here". mmm I've barely been able to sleep lately... it's a real bummer. I can't wait to fuck my kids up by pulling out yiddish words that have leaked into my vocabulary over the years, good luck to them. just did this.. whatchu got in mind??   I had a mini chocolate chip muffin. Worth it. I wish people would pronounce Pokémon correctly bc it's annoying +if they understand the accent then they would pronounce my last name right. that sounds really snobbish but for me it would kill two birds with one stone  .  oooh that sounds good! I like the  peanut butter ones too~....ok I'm getting hungrier -- bed time ! Have a good snack! I totally see your point but also consider that you get six Pokemon to fight with regardless of how many are at the gym. players who are further along will be kicking each other out so you can just sneak in when there's only one Pokemon at a gym~. it'll take some time still, but I believe in you !  also, idk whereabouts u are but it's much easier 2 train in city than suburb. no prob! Eep I live a bit out too orz There's some stuff if I walk into town but the city is so much more fun to play in. I have a 457 CP Ponyta ember 10/flame wheel 35 + a 415 CP Ponyta tackle 12(normal)/fire blast 60 What do? Will moves change when evolve? Asa. The temperature of the air outside is so similar to that of my internal body that I can't be sure I'm breathing . mm you're right .,, well I need some more candies before I can level up so I'll see maybe my perfect pony will come along! I finally ran into a PIkachu and it glitched end me. reminder bump bc I'm ordering in a few days . Since when does mortal instruments have a tv series???

I'm not gear with words but -Your art style is really unique and expressive! It's really fun to look at * U*. /sits in a pile of merch "I am ...

I want to reform my sleep schedule but even if I'm rested this seems too early ......... even my dog won't get up. omg my mom went to pick up something that I paid for and the freakin guy from Kmart had to call me.

ITS REALLY GOOD can I ramble to you in a dm. I've been doing a lot of charms lately so I feel the same way/sob I got a really nice brush pen but I can't use it well at all. weeps successful pre-orders make me happy, now I don't have to feel guilty about spending $$$ on charms for my cons since it's partly funded. it's..probably not...great... For some reason lots of people I follow on twitter slept really late today and I'm with you, buds. Boston "Ticket Sales Are Through The Roof" Comic Con asdfghjkl; But does that translate into AA sales... ordering is hard. My Twitter Account: 10% other people's art, 5% my art, 85% gripes . /BLUSH thank you !!!  btw your bnha charms are really adorable too aaa. /EYE ZOOMS@ TOGA I didn't order bc I couldn't pick which ones to get. clearly you are trying to make my life harder pfftt. hm my boyfriend had his work hours cut down and is now indulging in new and very addictive drugs -- what could possibly go wrong ? :|.

ITS OK BOO U GOT MORE THAN ENOUGH GOIN ON RIGHT NOW!! It's just bc I had the artists submit addresses in a dumb way orz I'll be ok! Me too. If I had them fill out individual fields it would've been fine to import it and boom good to go! But I didn't. So I had to. do em one by one. Plus I had them write their URL and not their e-mail so I had to reference and copy from a SECOND spreadsheet orz. ironically doing that messed up my arm, not the packages /lies down It'll resolve soon hopefully!! "well, now I know." - me abt everything that's gone wrong PFFF. weeps thank u cookies heal the soul.

Beautiful pic.twitter.com/ejqRHH05SU. THIS SHOW IS ALREADY REALLY GOOD. Please watch ERASED (I'm on episode 7 of 12 already). I'm starting to feel the effects of too much screen + caption reading but I MUST KNOW WHAT HAPPENS. Petition to give Satoru a fucking break. I watched a whole anime tonight. 6 hours. Who am I. Please watch ERASED. more like 4.5 I guess but I liked the OP so I barely skipped it . Airi is a cutie pie and I'd love to cosplay her but her design is really generic . Having a dog helps me with that a lot :) Especially such a hyper pup - she needs to get out or she loses her mind + bothers me . sob I love this so much .  omg that's a big compliment! Thank you!!

HE ALREADY PASSED AND KNOCKED OUT 120 PEOPLE??? THATS ENOUGH ALREADY?! not that he seems like the type to finish part-way through /lays down ...protect my children... OH..that'd be...an interesting match up tho...bc Todo can root himself w ice + maybe his fire would be a bad idea in the wind but. Ah..I'm waiting to hear back on two relatively important things. One said late August and the other by August 31st and I'M GETTING SCOOTCHY. oh shit I forgot about that....be strong, shouto . now that I think about it, Todoroki's seen a lot of shit lately (USJ, festival, Stain, training camp, etc) so maybe he'll prevail! do it!! I got some dark purpley ones that were nice! red's nice! Yeah I mean neutrals are fine but I ended up really liking my colored ones. It's less harsh(?) than black / dark brown. why. why can no one just do their job Form: Complete your section of the form before sending Registrar: Form must be blank Me: N.O. /snort I was thinking of how sometimes people draw chibi characters in/on desserts and how for Mob and Ritsu, the spoon could be bent ahaha. yeah!

Maybe you'll have a connection through someone at work or  put ads up in town :). It will be a lot to handle/do for a while but the result's worth it - moving away from a toxic environment to a beautiful place! <3. i'll cry if my bank rejects the charge bc japan.. OHHHH MY GOSH DOGS. Yeah def get settled first or get a slightly older dog. Cadence was 3 m/o and like a fucking baby had to be. under constant supervision for like 5 months. aside from teething though she was a good girl, potty trained quickly :). puppies are cute but if you're busy save an older doggie! not like OH GOD VET BILLS old but like 1-3 y/o haha. THATS LIKE. MY FAVORITE DOG BREED. imagine a universe where Cadence and new pupper have a playdate on a beautiful beach in Maine /daydreaming. that would be amazing !!   Cady gets along really well w dogs, my dog walker sent me a paragraph abt how much she loves her. She comes on rly strong tho like CHARGES then stops short and gently puts her face in their face.. Some dogs are like WTF R U DOIN. yeah!! If you have a Petco there's free puppy play time !! Training class is good too :) They're like kids, socialization is import. /looks at Cadence, who is scared of swimming, the hose, cardboard, the sound her food bag makes, dining chairs. most confusing is she is disturbed by fart sounds? She farts herself and then looks at her butt in a panic and runs away. and if you do a raspberry she looks at you w concern and either comes right over or runs away. aw. My Pichi anxiety barked, was wary of men, and scared of other dogs. She was on the streets for like a year tho :(. Cady was a few days old when found and doesn't know how lucky she is. IT LOUD. Is that common? keep him up to date on vaccinations for sure. There's usually clinics that are cheaper than the vet. this seems like the kind of thing that would keep you up at 4 AM. I didn't know if I could justify buying one but then I couldn't pick a color so I got two..(I'll resell one..) someone end me. omg Hagakure. This is a cute illustration, I'm not sorry  https:// twitter.com/itto101/status /722486762279284736   …. /sends my bf 3 articles, several pictures, and the names and locations of store@narita airport. they ended up flying straight there instead. it's not clear if he's arriving at 3 pm or 4 am so it may not be possible orz. His flight is 13 hr 30 since there's no layover in the US. Bless him. I need a fake ID, but only to see Drunk Shakespeare :(. I wish I had more money. Partly because financial security would squash a source of anxiety for me but also I WANNA GIVE PEOPLE PRESENTS. RIGHT like I saw someone like a certain character and now I wanna get them every piece of merch of them but I. Cannot. Aaaaa. Mom: I'll take puppedipoop and you'll do schpoopediboop?
Me: nah I'll take puppedipoop and can you do schpoopediboop? (actual conversation). mm!! I've been doing lots of trades lately with other artists and that's really fun!! . key: pupedipoop > puppy > Cadence schpoopediboop > Boobalboo > Bunny . :0 are they gonna make it there?? Last season was kinda slow-paced . OHHH I forgot about that tease!! They must then!! i would be so happy id die. It's time to play chest pains caused by anxiety or anxiety caused by chest pains??? Endless loop??? do your best! . >what kind of chest pain. achey?
>yeah. but like. a sharp ache.
>..like clenching?
>yeah. like clenching. but also. like bursting.
>jenn pls. mom: it's either a heart attack or a panic attack 
me, an anxious but otherwise healthy person: THOSE ARE EQUALLY LIKELY. please teach me how to draw todoroki shouto. to be fair, looking back I wish I pursued  a language at a younger age . I was going to link you to a drawing I saw. It was..your drawing. . My poor puppers was so sick all morning..she still clearly doesn't feel good ...tho the various bodily fluids have stopped . my bf watched civil war without seeing the first two cap movies and the last avengers movie.........................how........why......... THAT FIRST LINE IS LITERALLY A DESCRIPTION OF URARAKA WHO THE FUCK DID THIS I WILL END THEM. also why would you run a contest like this even fictitious girls can't catch a break amirite. they better have made a mall version of this as well or I s2g---. *male orz. Some photos my bf sent me from the Narita airport pic.twitter.com/4zHHdl3T1i. also, this one of him in a "smoking room" that looks like the hotline bling video   idk what his face is pic.twitter.com/FRTE5x8CWz. I AM (probably) FINE But thank you . Oh!! My bf is an airhead and thought his school started 2 weeks before it does so we get 1.5 weeks together instead of half a day ! . dear lord that exists??? I really want to make something beautiful for the kiribaku zine. Please give me a new arm   an illustration major with a nerve problem is no good /lays down. On the up side, my boyfriend sent me a video of himself surrounded by six tiny fluffy dogs. what's most confusing is he has three dogs there and none of the ones in the video were his . MMMM How do I get them to make those adorable ridiculous "Mochi" style plush of bnha / mp100 …. They took a piece of mine for an exhibition at school. I get an email today that I can pick it up now but also that it was too big sorry :|. she wrote to someone else that there wasn't room, but she put it in a video for the exhibit. Mine just says too big sorry orz. I'm more disappointed than I would have thought .,. RIGHT. "Chosen for an exhibition but then there wasn't enough room" isn't really something to put on a résumé . Mind you they requested my piece and took it in December. Apparently they haven't even held the exhibition yet. my school orz. oh!! I didn't even know you could do that!! twitter is amazing huh. I've always wished my phone could be significantly heavier!! (whispers) but also they're cute and I want twenty please. Yeeessss free tacos and a beautifully made cosplay I've been seeking ?? Night is on an upswing . what the flip flops. that's awful but i'm so distracted-CLEARLY THEY DONT KNOW HOW TO STEAL A PACKAGE CORRECTLY???

WAHH!! BNK BNK BNK. aaaa good luck!! My doc was just like " yea that's common read a book or smth" :/. my mom is spoiling my pup, giving her yogurt before she's had her regular food;;. oh good when she finished she ate her food instead of the paper cup! she is so smart pffff. Ah I chopped like 3" off my hair   I hate doing it but my ends were awful and I can't afford to go often so! Also, some1 please bully me into dyeing my hair bc I've been thinkin' abt it for years. I'm in art school, I feel it's a right of passage. ah! My hair is fine but it isn't super thin ;;. YES GOOD.

(It does sound brutal;;). yeah ! There's lots of words that sound completely made up - like mash ups of three different words;;. He got his bachelors in geology, so something in earth sciences.

(In case I get accepted, I'm sure competition will be steep!). mm it's typically about 3-8 weeks, build in a week and a half or so extension deadline :). if you make it on the longer side keep thanksgiving in mind when picking the date ~. and midterms!! . polls are good! Mm I think it varies. Well if you leave two weeks or so for an extension that should be good. @ rockboi4u  omigod. girl gang . NOICE. . I do this like once a week chill pic.twitter.com/HtLYWjwS9e.

Bless moderator I'm sorry I don't know your name. He has been rambling for like 5 minutes. Someone explain to Trump the difference between the words Hispanic and Latinx. "I won't mention that" - Trump, mentioning something.

We'll make a proper post / open apps soon~. I wanna make a button for Election Day that (instead of "I voted") says, "I did what I could. Lord help us all.".

I'm glad you've had time to draw - loving your newest stuff!!  I think animenext too, right? and so I relatively politely called them out and asked for credit and they went into hyper self deprecating mode and I'm just.

I'm thinking ... we.. may have underestimated the interest in this zine LMFAO im kinda worried about waking up to more apps . these are so beautiful I died. Every once in a while this girl I was friends w for 8 years before she dumped me out of nowhere likes a post of mine. it just makes me sad . 8 years of being close, at one point saying I was her only real friend, then just..nothing.I try not to think about her too much. This was a mistake /so many apps . That's fine! Put your Twitter there instead. SORRY IM LURKING but the rough deadlines are outlined on the FAQ page ;). happens to the best of us . nice!!

Wanting to draw and not being able to is such an antsy, awful feeling . Is watching Yuri on ice sinning??   (happy[?] Yom Kippur). Does it count as fasting if I had pizza rolls at 3 am. I'm not a good Jew. I'm not very religious, but one day a year to atone for your sins seems like it should be very doable. It upsets me that Yuri got a dog after Viktor yet Yuri's died while Viktor's is still alive.. rip Vicchan. it made me really happy when instead of being like OHNoOHNo Yuri was like oh, i see - this little shit is underestimating me. yeah!! it was a nice surprise !! Like he's still anxious but he didn't crumble. same here!! they've all surprised me too, I'm so looking forward to meeting the rest!! * U*.

I drank too emphatically and spilled water down my front + I'm wearing a onesie and it went all the way down to my ankle + it was Unpleasant.

No1 is safe from my excessive twitter searching of YoI zine >:3   no, no rush!! Just sayin another place 2 get feedback~. hell time RTHIJRSEGKRDTHJ. Actual torture. Most spoken sentence in my life: it's still not up. Remember last year when it went up at 12:11. sighs dreamily. Live tweets sign ups for a full hour. I am Not Strong Enough. Please Nikki my dog and I both have to use the bathroom. hnnnnnnnn. where is my email i will literally cry
where is my email where is it where. i don't mind when it's up before 12:30 but this was too long. I submitted at or before 1:11 but still no email i'm gona die. I GOT MY EMAIL FUCKING TEN MINutes LATE but the timestamp says 1:09 bless. it's because of the different lengths of tables, I think. same orz. hn It's usually up before 1 that was..really long this year...I was lucky but I can imagine if i crashes that must be beyond awful. @ villainsbn  how'd it go for you?  @u@ ;;;. OHH PRETTY GOOD!!! I've only seen a few 1:09, 1:10 and 1:11 seem popular. I wish it broke down into seconds though aaa. Yeah last year it was 12:11!! aaaahhh That must've been incredibly frustrating D: Good luck!!! ohh actually it was 12:01 ; ) I'm so glad I'm quick and lucky aaaa bless my wifi. OUCH that's rough :/ Hm maybe you'll get off the wait list or find a buddy or day of? There's still hope!! I wish I just had one more day to get all this stuff done ugh. UM. "we had about 600 submissions within first minute". that's. Way more than usual. FUCK That's insane...that's..insane. yeah no that's an insane increase from last year I think they'll almost definitely change it now. I am. .so stressed. about so many things. /selfdestructs. aha I appreciate it but there's no such thing as taking it easy with a midterm, two essays, and more for monday! :'). weeps i'm sorry it's relatable for you /pats. I write my double-spaced essays single-spaced + adjust them later. My brain finds it rewarding - 2.5 pages instantly, magically turn into 5. (whispers) this essay..is going...better than I thought it would/??....... MMM I finished and it's exactly four pages but it needs to be..five. JUST KIDDIGN IT SAYS FOUR TO FIVE NOICE (I can just proofread and see where i'm at and add a little to fill it out~). The most excited I'll ever be about $12. Bless you, ko-fi, and the person who donated  pic.twitter.com/VqAFexYphb. AJDBJSKDN FUCK my estranged friend appeared and is going to be in my town all day tomorrow and 2 essays midterm drawings wwwwhhyyabdjd. I've been working hard all weekend and was just starting to feel like I could finish everything at a reasonable hour 2moro orz. (whispers) I keep seeing this phrase photoshopped onto bnha characters please help. I SEE. THANK YOU!! . hahah what? No, no, I just wanted to know the meaning/origin! . ERASED IS CRAZY GOOD IT NEEDS SO MUCH MORE LOVE. hnnn more like Trump anything for the past year and a half. We're in the home stretch..pray . LRT As a jew, the parallels between Trump and Hitler are disturbing, as well as with American's opinion on taking in Syrian refugees pretty. much mirroring surveys taken about taking in Jews (even just children) during the Holocaust. Have we learned nothing? I left the part of the midterm that eludes me most for last. It was. A Mistake. I was waitlisted for magfest but they personalized my email so at least that was cute :'). omg bakugou has bad qualities but that wouldn't b v heroic!i just thought he asked/made Denki electrify himself 2 cheer up the class. yeah I saw a lot of people saying that so I'm really glad he made a point of inserting that text :'). I think they took them still bc didn't they say that Inasa scored higher than Todoroki? pic.twitter.com/wEyRUa85tl. but then there's also this?? It's more confusing bc there's two parts to the entrance exam.. pic.twitter.com/WCr3nMTf5y. I thought Bakugou and Deku were in different groups though? I still can't draw cats but I like this doodle pic.twitter.com/iQH6TONr7K. THAT WAS SO PAINFUL AND UNSATISFYING. also my boy for this project is now officially left-handed ( whispers) bc I keep fucking up. PURE BEAUTY. LRT FUCKING YURIO OMIGOdaeghsrjktrl fgunh. (whispers) Are you sure it's a plush version? Cause I thought there were only plushes of Deku, Bakugou, Todoroki, and Uraraka? !!! Oh!! That's amazing!! EXCEPT NO KIRISHIMA?! . OH NO(i need him) Thank you so much for this info!! . Lrt even more painfully embarrassing in English. Friendly reminder that art is subjective . also I think it's really important to include a variety of styles.. I know omg it's ..they change so many normal lines for no reason but then they get YoI and they're like nah we'll keep this. I'm glad theyre staying true 2 original - wish they would always. I just think they make ? choices abt what arbitrary lines 2 change. hmm I just saw one person saying bad things publicly..they were "appalled" by our choices. In general tho people have been so amazingly gracious and supportive - to a point where I was surprised and touched :). mm I'm just a bit perturbed w what they said in particular :/ But in general its been surprisingly great! Gotta let this 1 go haha. ps your latest kirishima is so gorgeous my friend literally sent it to me before I saw it . KILLIN ME NICOLE Hrnnn   !!!!! Shits getting real. aaa I feel ya I think I'm gonna restart my piece bc I'm not happy   It's coming along great tho good luck!! Lineless is hard . also we rejected...almost all of our friends. (Sorry I'm done now , just got me riled up bc we worked hard  !! ). like i think we let in quite literally two friends..out of 50.....and their art..is really nice...ok i'm really shutting up now. weeps almost everyone has been great and i'm not trying to make a scene - certainly not trying to call them out or start anyth. ing but they said some really rude, presumptuous statements that got me riled up so I'm just venting.. I'm gonna stop now!! Sorry for the negativity ya'll have been great i love you marry me. And now, tweets about the importance of voting tomorrow pfthahah. OH MY GOD HE SNAPPED HIS LITTLE NECk rip abe. ...........could it be..... -dramatic pause- muRDER?! D: gasp! no sticker???? Let's be real, we all secretly really want that sticker.. OH NO sheepies.. my dog walker took my dog but we didn't leave yet and it's so eerily quiet and empty how do people survive w/o dogs???? (whispers) sorry to bother u but my friend + I  r wondering where u saw this announced /preorder ? I can't find it anywhere D:. Don't forget to check on your state's ballot questions before voting !! There are important topics there across the nation . I hope the animal one passes here it's fucking inhumane. aaa no, that's very helpful!! Thank you so much!! . I MET THIS CAT by chance. he rubbed against my legs and went in like four circles around me then rolled around he's so cute  pic.twitter.com/R0OefN3RFr. update I just met him again on my way out and he did it again and followed me for a while I wanted him aaa. @ villainsbn  your twitter name rn is beautiful. lady on the tv: it's been a year and a half since clinton and trump announced their candidacy. let's take a look back --- me: NOOOOOOOOOOOOO. THATS FRIGHTENING where are you?? MA is predicted to vote 94% Clinton :'). OHNO really?? Overall your state should be blue tho.. idk why ya'll don't have early voting either it's so odd. omg bill maher is cursing up a storm on tv holy shit. Hrrnng I'm getting a headache from furrowing my brow and clenching my jaw when will this hell end. in like, some hours. but still. no thanks HRTJHIJ fuck time zones, go faster. fuck thi s is so stressful. I know I already tweeted that exact statement but i'm so fucking stressed out. you too hnnnnn i'm gonna eat too .... i'll try to be conscious of my consumption dghj. hnn I know, I hate that we're in the middle rn. gotta wait to reach the other coast which should be blue..... this is getting too close i just feel like crying. MICHIGAN IS STREsSING ME OUT . also NH ?? GET IT TOGETHER NHrshylgu. im sorry but if u voted third party or sat it out i'm pretty pissed at u. I understand, but this was NOT the election to try to make a point. hnhtrht it's only 10% reporting rn there but.. NO SHIT, PBS. same. hi UH NEW HAMPSHRIE WAHT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING. why the fuck are you voting Trump and why are you taking so goddamn long what the fuck. embarrassed to be neighbors with ya'll right now but I know there's still time.. I know right?? ya'll are usually blue with us...we really need you to be blue,. Florida. You are ridiculous. Great example of the third parties being a spoiler vote. Ya'll fucked up. During the third debate Trump said, "How stupid are we?" and right now I'm agreeing with him. he'll hit 270 by a vote or two and i'll fucking throw up. he better not. he better fucking not. I stopped drawing hours ago
i'm just sitting here listening with my eyes watering feeling nauseated. "what did we get wrong?" "the numbers." YEAH NO FUCKing shit. In a situation where Trump is impeached, MIKE PENCE is a fucking piece of shit conversion therapy homophobe who wants control of your uterus. Pennsylvania. I don't have faith but still, I was counting on you. my dog is sleeping peacefully and i am so jealous. come thru guys. With 0% reporting they called MA for Hilary. That's how chill we are. I'm white. Jewish-but my last name is French. I'm cis. I'm straight(ish). I'm not going to do anything rash. Aside from my uterus, I'm safe. I feel sick to my stomach. My eyes have been leaking for an hour. I cannot imagine how those of you who aren't safe are feeling. Please be strong. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. A few of you wrote nice things to me. I really appreciate it though I'm too disturbed to reply to them. Thank you. I'll be ok. So many people won't be ok. So many people. I'm so scared for you. Disgusted, for you. Please be strong. I don't know what 2 say. ..Hilary is leading NH by. 18 votes. .....18. votes. "We're all dancing on this cliff together." That's. A good metaphor, news man. far from the biggest of my concerns rn, but I should've paid my tenso shipping before today.. I wanted that Deku nendoroid.. Please move to California, or Mass. We'll be good to you. But so many people can't just fucking do that. Shit. I don't want to go to school tomorrow. I'm sure a lot of people won't show. We're v liberal, 80% women and LOTS of lqbtq+ folks. Not 2 promo a webcomic while our country's enveloped in magma but tinf is so good w/ lots of silliness pls read it if you need a distraction https:// twitter.com/WhitLeopard/st atus/796170689443020801   …. Remember how we overthrew the government a couple hundred years ago? ... u down or????????? :|. How can this white woman say this in front of this black man who just gave the most beautiful painful speech. Unreal. goodnight. I wish you a deep, dreamless, restful sleep.  deal with the morning in the morning. ha, I'll try  thank you . Lrt so poignant. "We've got another projection" I don't want it. bless you, I stopped drawing hours ago. I am so scared for all the hate crimes + suicides tomorrow. Stay safe, loves. I know I'm not gonna be much help but I'm here if you need me. I feel you. CNN airing a trailer for a film about the Supreme Court case about interracial marriage right now. feeling ironic. Thank you for your words earlier. They were so poignant. Made me cry (again.) I'm so sorry. Bless you. Friendly reminder to Alaska that you're right next to FUCKING Russia. Rest up. We're in for a rough tomorrow. I wish you a deep, restful sleep . I'm so sorry. maybe you should try to rest and sleep. Or call a loved one or a hotline if you're feeling really unwell. his vice President is similarly disgustingly awful. Bye PA. You don't get to be part of the northeast anymore. Except for Philly..ya'll are alright. ..it's not happening. Pence. Conversion, shock therapy for gays, makes women w miscarriages hold funerals for their lost fetuses. Real ray of sunshine. I'm gonna see how I feel tomorrow. I'm sure my teacher would understand. Any of u weebs got a Death Note laying around from '06. I know it's awful and we've got a 3x red situation but that's not gonna happen. I know after this anything feels possible afte. r this assbackwards election but we got SCOTUS passed we cannot go that far backwards. I know it's hard to think that rightnow. I don't blame you for feeling like this, but please please be strong. take deep breaths. call a hotline if you need to. ohhh, john. he's tryna. Pence is scary as fuck but I don't think he'd be able to really be able to turn things around. I hope Trump is convicted in his rape trial. We all are. I'm really surprised by PA though :\ Obviously it's not your fault! YeahThat's scary. I'm so scared of tomorrow's headlines...hate crimes, harassment, and suicides/attempts seem inevitable. remember 5 hours ago when I thought there was a possibility I wouldn't have to see this man's face ever again. I told my poc boyfriend be safe bc his state is red and he lectured me about how not to tell people how to vote and how he has his reasons. I told him to be safe bc people are scared and he told me not to force my opinion on others. um. he said he may drop his vote off tomorrow. is he .. ok????? um. is he on something. now he's .... he's saying disturbing things.. I love him we've been together almost five years what is happening. I don't want to lose him. he's scaring me right now...what the fuck is going on. so far the content of trumps' speech isn't making me vomit . that's about as much as i can give ya'll right now. I don't believe him. This situation could not be worse, but this speech could be worse. um did someone yell 'kill obama' just then............idk if the first word was kill so don't quote me idk what they said before 'obama' but. i wouldn't be surprised. Take the day off. "I wanna thank my parents who are looking down on me right now" Half of America is looking down on you too (in a different way). wonder if I should've kept that CAD from otakuthon. uh did smoeone turn off trump's teleprompter he just referenced a racehorse. if we still have a planet that's habitable. "You can't always get what you want" literally playing in the background. You did your best. More than most people. PEOPLE ARE SO SEXIST it's 3 AM give her tomorrow to make her speech ?? go fuck yourself???? Friendly reminder that it's been 96 years since women got the right to vote and yet here the fuck we are. new twitter name in honor of the election. i wish there was a station i could watch where people stared stone-faced at a wall. that's the only commentary i'm look for. NO THANKS.......... I have a migraine. I am nauseous. Too tired to cry any more. Please be safe, take care of yourself, seek help if you need it. Be strong. <3. "Assassinate that bitch!" "Kill Obama" - actual quotes from the crowd at Trump's victory speech. I have no words. Going to try to sleep. Stay safe. just kidding I had one more cry in me. I hope to awaken to an alternate reality. Here's a picture of my dog with a triple chin. She is the last pure thing in this world. pic.twitter.com/UYNg4oGygq. that would be amazing, please do . Can't wait to tell my future children about this. Assuming they have a habitable planet live on. I really take for granted that I live in such a liberal part of the country. I'm glad I was born and raised here and became the person I am. I just wish I could do more - could do fucking /anything / for the rest of you. it'll be ok. It won't be good, but I feel like in the end it'll be ok. I can't wait for our asses to grow up and take this shit. show over+make real progress. Fucking old people just got the death grip on our politics rn+won't let go. brexit all over again. I don't care if this sounds bad - I can't wait for the older people who fucked us w this mess finish their lives + leave this mess to our. progressive asses. Aside from age - by 2020 whites won't be the majority anymore..then u gotta wait for the kids to turn 18 sigh. we will. It just won't be tomorrow. Or four years from now. It's going to take a lot of long hard fights but it's possible. I have faith in our generation. We just have to make it to that point and hope the actions of those before aren't irreparable. you should get off here for a bit. I'm drowning in this too but you gotta take a break. i'm convinced that my dog is also too depressed to get up she's like 'humans, am i right'. I'm glad I haven't donated all the zine money yet. I'm thinking planned parenthood, ACLU, and a suicide prevention of lqbt organization ? Please let me know if you know of any accountable charities or have suggestions. I want to do whatever i can. $1k each to Planned Parenthood, ACLU, American Foundation for Suicide Prevent, Los Angeles LGBT Center. Hows that sound? (From zine funds). Too good for this world pic.twitter.com/60AnMTjmiE. PHICHIT THIS SONG IS AWFUL SWEETHEART. Cute American skater is optimistic and it's feeling REALLY IRONIC RIGHT NOW. Omg I feel violated these skate routines are .. I don't know how to feel .. Marry me pic.twitter.com/wJSSoPexME. My teacher is so great. I didn't go today but apparently she checked in w everyone and then they went to a museum. I don't even know what to do with this guy. or that other russian guy. same. i think the headache is nationwide. same. went on a walk in the woods with my pup. wish i could've kept walking forever. ahh she's not counting absences today either. she's the literal best. Gonna watch Hilary's concession speech bc I love to suffer. @ my period: NOW IS Not tHe FUCKING TIME. Give me Elizabeth Warren 2020 (Michelle is amazing I'd love her too but I don't think she'd do it  ). Today I sorted through my things and gathered a good chunk of stuff to donate to HAWC's holiday program. Feels good. Be good to each other. Facebook pressuring me to publicly announce how much I've been crying pic.twitter.com/us623IB7If. pic.twitter.com/3nksu4HQum. I'm feeling very worried about my boyfriend. He seems to be taking more pills. He was freaking me out last night and he looks...unwell. I didn't even /think/ of attending the boston protest - didn't realize it was happening. I wish I had been there. Sitting here is much worse. mom: this seems like a very sad snack
me: well i'm a very sad person. sorry I need more time to mourn these results. I encourage you to mute me if you need pure positivity <3 <3 <3. work in progress /lays down pic.twitter.com/sWNjaSylRy. There's more protests scheduled for tomorrow and the next day. I wish my brother was home. I want to go but not alone.. Writing to my French friend about what's going on and how I feel and I'm shaking and I hate this. Fucking staples. I told gave him the files and told him the exact sizes and paper type and he's like come in so I can show u the papers. like no I don't wanna come in another time (the printer I need doesn't run all day) just do what I asked?!? Shndksks annooyinngg. he wrote it really rudely like I didn't give him any information. I just need u to put the paper in and hit print buddy. oh no! :( I don't like to print there unless it's last minute but I need single prints for something and it was cheapest there. but the one near me has this really nice photo paper so!! Not all of them do. yiiikes! I hope they provided a solution for you :(. aaaaaAAAAAAAaaa. !!! Congrats Sunny !! . susnhajs tokoyami.. I don't have much hope for LRT but it's worth noting that this is how our system works and isn't that so ridiculous? I would love for an upset there though it's unlikely but it would also show that we really aren't in control cause they could. hypothetically do this for ANY election. Like 99% chance they won't, but they could and that's fucked up. also I'm p sure republicans control the house so having them end up deciding would not be helpful. This week's bnha: Jennie feels confused and then gets one spread of content she understands. I mean I'm sure he's going somewhere w it and informing us of the situation is important I just expected my kids is all. so cute!! (Both of you!!) . I think it's been established that that's an edit;; :(. Lrt I've been feeling really devastated and downtrodden because of the election but it felt good to donate to these organizations which will. help so many people like my peers who I had to watch panic and experience so much pain last Tuesday night. My brother wrote something nice about me and damnit he made me cry ahha. asdfghjk No, YOU are those things!! I'm so impressed by how you're able to be so motivated +productive even when things are tough<3. omg. Hey.

They're just fucking w/ us..........definitely just...ha.ha...very funny guys...noW PUT IT BACK TOGETHER. I always think I know where this show is going and then they do something else...so if I think they're still getting married am I cursing it. if he meant anything more than 'i see that look in your eyes, go skate again viktor + break yuri's new record' i will just. evaporate.

(whispers) writing two essays and studying for finals? :') hahaha no no I'll be ok! Lrt makes some good points!!! :O. pff I remember watching ep 1 + everyone was pretty impressed, then 2 and 3 happened + it was like 'did they use up the budget'. (whispers) I can't stand him either good riddance but it was nice to see another side of him that wasn't bravado + catchphrases. something about lrt is so satisfying. baby yurio and otabek are so cute. this is blowing my mind. pic.twitter.com/cWBZMQ3QM7.

THREE in March.... I update my to do list. it is 1/3 email people back, 1/3 essays + finals, 1/3 GET/SEND PRESENTS FOR PEOPLE IMMEDIATELY. you're all set!! :) Mostly we just wanna make sure no1 fell off the face of the earth + have some semblance of what they'll do haha. mm first year cons are always a risk so it depends how much you'd have to invest :0. ahaha Sounds good! ; ) I have some ideas floating around my brain but I haven't committed any to paper yet (oops!). last night I totally fucked up everything I tried to memorize but the 1st try today I nailed it SO GET A GOOD NIGHTS SLEEP EVERYONE. TT u TT Bless this post (finals til the 19th, another deadline on the 20th). OH NO yeah no don't go !! I'm feeling conflicted over table fees so please don't spend that much to go . if you want I'll let you know how it goes for next year but that's way too risky to travel that much!! PUPPY BUTT. ah, I know :( Sometimes it isn't sensible even tho more cons = more fun! There's lots of other adventures ahead I'm sure ! <3. ME THIS MORNING I have a deviated septum, do you have sinus problems too or just the cold? confirmed. the part separating the nostrils is an S shape instead of straight so it's blocked in the front and back and causes problems;;. ack try warm compress to break up mucus, saline spray/rinse to clear + keep it from drying out/bleeding,flonase for swelling orz. minami's hair may be stupid af, but he has hinata's seiyuu and his cheerleading is really cute. !! It's not cool I do like 4 nasal sprays a day orz I could get surgery but..scary. It's funny how every1 has their weakness tho. mm!! If you go smth like  Sudafed it's good for swelling + pressure but it gives me insomnia+ more anxiety so be gentle w dosing. WHA. YOU R phone can even process tha tmuch!?! I'm stupidly proud of myself for flossing + using mouthwash every day now...too bad I had to get gingivitis to motivate me . If u ever feel bad about inconsistency just look at this screenshot pic.twitter.com/aWkvkwTZfm. blatantly broadcasts my impatience to the world hashtag false advertising hashtag fake news. My dog just tried to eat a clump of hair.. . Lrt YELLING. I wish that was what happens when my hand slips . ahhh those two make a great pair!! I dropped off all the packages this morning but none of them are showing as scanned bc usps is so busy = n= ;;. otabek is such a good boy too. My brother berated me for "chewing loudly" . I didn't see shinsou in the new one u nu;; Can't remember if Denki.. Snow day!! GOALS: GONNA STAY IN write essays, catch up on the packages/emails I have left, go play in the snow w Cady and then get a tree . bf: I bought you a ring!

(whispers) I think you interpreted this in the opposite way! ;) BUT I APPRECIATE THE GESTURE ahaha. ahahah I was just like '...a....ring..' + he quickly realized the societal implications + clarified LMFAO ahaha thank you! :P. so adorable and well done!! . Heheh puppy loves the snow so much she just sprinted through it our whole walk and now she's wiped out. I can't tell if this second essay is too close to an essay she had us do in class on the midterm bc of my choice in paintings ehjdgf. I wanna make a house for my zines .. I have some more traditional staples, photocopied ones and some more like softcover books. omg sorry LIKE A LITTLE ONE ... pic.twitter.com/YKtOkOeNZ5.

I think I'd rather have them on display though   That's a good way to store them tho!! oh!cute! I think the traditional way 4 zines is clothespinned but w that+clipboards some zines are too heavy/it'll leave dents . ahaha no problem! I had something like it when I was little but it was flimsy cardboard..time for grown up version!! Ahah. I want to make an otabek/yurio charm w them on his moto . ahah thank you! I'll have to make it but I'm not good at ..making things orz Gonna bug engineer bf for help heh.

Someone liked a drawing I literally don't even remember drawing. aaa I  twitter balloons!! Also (whispers) I wished u happy bday/xmas on other accnt but maybe I wrote it like a reply by accident? supposed to have gone up a few minutes ago but.. . Same. I applied to a con in /Hawaii/. My new motto is: fuck it. I think it used to be FCFS but it's lottery now. this is so cute already . I'm sure it will be!!! what the fuck!? D: This reminds me of when I was asked, "If you're Jewish why isn't your nose big? I don't usually get into sims but omigod why is lrt so hilarious. I KNOW IM OBSESSED THE PIECE SO NICE  TT u TT. well, I'm biased ;) heh But I've seen everyone's wips +they're. Honestly gorgeous. You'll have more previews to look at soon~. Lrt I'll never get over this. I love my angry son a lot but still this isn't what Horikoshi envisioned . My pup threw up after going to this park a couple days ago, then was fine. We took her there against yesterday and she threw up again. Hmmm. I'm DYING THIS IS SO CUTE and well done!!! nice skill using icing, that can be tricky!! @ hawberries_  I hecked up + forgot to ask u to sign your zine in the notes@checkout :') If u happen to remember, please do!

I just wanted you to know I didn't forget ;) Hope you had a lovely time!! <3 <3 <3. nah, it's a dog park! ..maybe just sickness from other dogs? D:. 2016 was shit but there was some GOOD ANIME Pls watch ERASED, Mob Psycho 100, Yuri!!! on Ice (whispers) bnha was good but I prefer the manga. I've seen this around and it's cute!! What season does my art remind you of? Good thing abt popular fandoms: lots to read Bad thing abt it: ALSO A LOT OF ????? FICS that u gotta put down and gtfo of there. refresher course for poll and approaching new year ;). (whispers) I'm really curious now........................... ....maybe Jennie's inconsistency is showing>??? lmfao. I want to support artists I love and own lots of zines and original comics and things but $$$ </3. I'm used to being poor but now that we have some amount of money I still feel so gross and greedy and spoiled when I buy things. Yes TT n TT I'm like wooo yoi charms went really well but I could easily spend that much on charms for AB hahaha. it's also super stressful bc artists. Sell out of things. Close their shops for off season or con season. Go to shows far away. I do a lot of ogling at things I want, keeping the tab open perpetually until they sell out or close their shop + then i'm sad. TT n TT And I'll like count down to the days orders end for things and then STILL NOT BUY THEM. I just bought from 2 artists last night .. I haven't really done that since summer? I really love them but I STILL FEEL AWFUL. YEP. Some artists open/close sporadically w no warning too. I also love antagonizing myself by checking the quantity left over and over again. OH!! That's far!! I'm so sick of being waitlisted I've applied to cons in CA, WA, even freaking Hawaii - JUST IN CASE haha. hnnn ones you have to travel for are tricky. I like NJ/PA bc my bf is in Philly so then at least I can see him a bit;;. but what's worse than lodging/gas is PUPPY CARE COSTS /lookin a u, Cadence. My brother is home and he loves cooking and food shopping. There's no room in the fridge so he keeps PUTTING THE POTATOES IN THE HALLWAY. prays 4 animenext ... Sign ups should be soon ... It's lottery so gotta be lucky~. It was p good last year even tho new location/I WAS SHOVED IN THE BACK CORNER I'd imagine it's def. worth it if you're local. tabling vs attending is a very different experience so I completely understand. It's more fun since I made friends to neighbor! Yeah!! May as well apply! :) You can always say no if you get in and don't wanna~. The xx is so chill  https://www. youtube.com/watch?v=1_oA9U mRd4I   …. My pup has been lonely (we took the cushion off her couch bc she vomited on it) and she's so happy to be up here cuddling me now. im' dying someone bought one button for $1, storenvy took .35 commission, I undercharged them .06 shipping, costs .20, plus packaging LMFAO. so silly but 100% my fault . give people the power to choose they choose wrong #TheGiverReference. yes!! I'm doing a bad job at following people across all their social media haha. ?!??!

Good luck you 2! regardless I plan on adding this to my newly formed zine collection one way or another! . It is cold. It is snowing. ..AH. This pin went through the wash but it survived!!

My neighbors do laundry every morning and it makes my bed shake and I'm so tired and it makes me nauseous . I'm starting to feel so overwhelmed abt march..3 cons, midterms, btmh zine wrap up/shipping, other zine pieces due, cover commission??? this is cute . I'm trying to pick clothes/things to donate bc I have accumulated lots of things other people could use that I dont need + moving eventually. and instead of finding clothes to get rid of i'm just finidng lots of cute merch from trades over the summer LOL fun tho. omg like don't get me wrong I love 95% of these things but holy shit theres so many. hnnn i'm one link away from it fitting around my wrist.. why do i wanna put awful plastic chain on it + make absurd 90s jewelry. !!! Mine are mostly hearts but I have one star! In love them even tho I don't understand them . Ah I did so many trades at cons this summer and it's fun making connections and they're all cute but I could do without some of the stuff. I've accumulated. I certainly don't wanna throw it out and reselling seems bizarre .. do I just give it away with orders? . Its sort of an awkward situation   I just want em to go to good homes where they'll be used/appreciated instead of gatheringdust. Also in case u were wondering how my BNHA ita worked out..it didn't   I did so many trades that there's not enough room so I abandoned it  pic.twitter.com/OgseBkJoh7. this is why I'm trying to be pickier with YoI//stick to my theme fairly strictly. i've moved from things i pulled out of my closet that i've had since i was 12 to giant bag of clothes from my bf's mom. she's so small i cant fit in 90% of them it's giving me acomplex. ITS CAUSE YOU PICK OBSCURE CHARACTERS I Just WENT: fucK IT GIVE ME EVErything. wedding theme!!! >:) ahaha yeah the wego <3 bags are kinda small;; gotta get a tote or smth pic.twitter.com/kWNYH1d6wJ. aa thank you!! I wanna see yours when you make it! aa I'm not sure! 1 of mine is a knockoff, the other i'm buying off a friend;;. I know there are bigger tote style ita bags tho !! not sure if they're by wego is all. the key to not stopping half way through cleaning is to lose your phone on silent inthe mess you created so you have to keep going. (whispers) I know I'm like "why do I kinda wanna keep this..".  omg the crop on mobile is just my legs . that's how u know it's too short ahahaha. I'm in this group!! there's group orders sometimes? they're probably US group orders but  https://www. facebook.com/groups/itabags/  . https:// docs.google.com/document/d/1nz zfTUCq5O0KHA3eqC1Spk0Q9ZxQmZOs4ckHVy4ZIGk/edit   …. sergijrhtt i'm dyin 2.5 hours in and i am taking a food break..there's still so much to do my life is amess. lmfao maybe with...tights....................but I think it's a lil much for 'everyday' .. I'll keep it tho it's cute LOL. i'm gettin rid of so much it feels ... good to donate  alot but bad bc i like holding onto things TT A TT. but it's like i've had some of these since I was 12-14 and I'm almost 21 they NEED TO GO + other ppl could use them. i'm sorry for livetweeting my cleaning spree btw ahahahah. ?!?!!?! U OK BUDDY?! Ahahhahaha my neighbors have people staying w them and cady doesn't recognize them and it's a woman w a baby and my dog is just SCREAMING. Oh!!!

I don't have any tote at all tho so I'd have to look around haha Thanks for the tip tho !!! * U*. ahhh yeah!!  I wish I had watched it sooner!! * U*. Oh no I spent 5 hours cleaning + trying on clothes + didn't realize that I'm gonna have to do the same at my grandma's tomorrow   a mistake. ahhh no problem! I'm really new to this too so I'm glad I could help . omg I forgot I had a couple on my school backpack too . Also surprisingly I think I've acquired enough oofuri fan merch to make a little bag? I wonder if any have circle windows.. SIDHGD SG GOOD LUCK!! THIS LOOKS GREAT THO. (whispers) If I wanted some of these...would you wanna trade again>??   If not it's totally cool + I'll buy em, just lemme know! Ah yes just how I like to be woken up at 7:30 thank you sun super cool pic.twitter.com/I4rp9L6UDO.

I was leaning that way, mostly just debating bc the frame on the other is really elegant ahahah. thank you!! . that's what I'm thinking -- he can be fancy but he has to be able to see his husband . mm I'm sure I could but the cutesy hearts probably pair better w the chibi-ish style ~. I put my BNHA charms with the rest and replaced them w @unagicakee 's hiyori and yato that I found while cleaning yesterday !   super cute! pic.twitter.com/LOf37sAKxo.  ohhh ! I do trust your judgement tho .. maybe I'll ask her to see what it looks like~. ps your wedding charm is clearly going in the middle of the bag . tru. I'll definitely post a pic when it's done! Ahah that's ok I'm waitin on p much everything-I won't even have the bag for 2 wks . I'm also waiting on my charm order so I feel u orz. /sweats it's close.. I asked her to show me what it'd look like . so much goodness!! I recognize a lot of this ahahah. i've been awake for like 6 hours and I am Ready for Bed what is stamina. YES I AM EXCITED and she hand draws each one in color pencil (how does anyone tolerate that medium) so it's OOAK. bless her. LRT THE MAKKACHIN ahhahahrjkyh. my dog is such a good dog i love. my tattoo drawings for class are pretty unoriginal but I'm having fun;; I...kinda bent the assignment to my will tho but shes's p flexible. ohohoh heart buttons should be here wednesday~~. @ hasuyawwn  don't worry, we'll make sure to give you the extras you asked for! Good luck with your AFEST app!! We'll check back ;). BUT HOW. Hnn I don't wanna pay mad $$$ for a new WEGO brand bag but they're the only ones that have that ridiculous teal like Deku's hero suit. I HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO RECONCILE OUR STYLES but here's a quick thing _(:3」∠)_ pic.twitter.com/UKub4vvw6e. Tattoo design assignment I disregarded and did this instead LOL pic.twitter.com/tgP6Gmu0jZ. @ the_sad_gay  OMIGODR YOUR TWITTER NAME KIlLED ME osngorthyth ahhahahahah BRILLIANT. this series of comics is a blessing. OH!! PROBAbly....checked with me then? (there's no lotus or lily pad emoji? :( ) .  EEEEEEP thank you so much!! I'm glad you like it!! I wish I drew more TINF fan art but omg styling is a STRUGGLE. I almost asked what he'd wear but I was feeling SO WEIRDLY SURE it would be a light blue tux that I was like nah I got this . OMIGOD. didn't get a shipping notif so ngl when I found it I let out a sound of delight LMFAO thank you @mangokappu  !Adding to my wedding ita pile  pic.twitter.com/G3DJUUEXob. I am a mess. Couldn't fall asleep til 6, up from 9-11:30, out of bed at 3, burnt my food, left the oven on, forgot what time my class is at. oh no I don't mind, I just meant it was really a surprise!!   thanks again! Why do people knock on locked bathroom doors?? It's clearly occupied but even if it wasn't it's locked??? aaa thank u! It's such a unique, amazing style - I didn't wanna copy it tho - I don't think I even can   glad I found a balance. shdnnajs did u post it??? Maybe I saw it a long time ago! If not (whispers) I wanna see . OHHH!! It's always such a surprise when I fill orders and then someone I know on twit/instagram posts them and i'm like IT WAS YOU. Thank you for your support!!! <3 I hope they keep motivating you!!! . Just another day of biting off more than I can chew and feeling the anxiety like a weight on my chest . looks so amazing   I hope to get to this point someday!! :). Me, getting a big commission: do you know how much yuri on ice merch I could buy with------.  thank you!! My workload is mostly things I'm excited about but it's just. A lot at once. . it's gonna be difficult to get juuuuust the right amount of sloppy drunk yuuri on my wedding ita . aahah thanks! I'd love to but I can't really back out of any of them :') I'll just plan to never do anything again after April 2nd :P. THESE ARE SO GREAT I AM SO EXCITED going to see if I can get some friends to split some with me ;). yeah I'm an idiot I saw it after . definitely   i was so happy that twitter was like "you missed this" bc i couldn't find it again when I looked the other day. I'm thinking about posting in a fb group+ splitting sets to get extra goodies (buttons would go to the person who got corresponding. doll, raffle off the stickers and tote between participants). lemme know if u potentially want in, I'm gonna ask for a shipping quote to see if it makes sense to split. may split w/ friends if makes sense monetarily with shipping cost. Could u estimate shipping cost to US for 3 prem. All set? :). I hear ya! I only preordered two keychains and the nendo so I didn't dig too deep of a hole for myself yet . snfjdnusbs my myfigurecollection wishlist and eBay watch list are growing by the day so I feel u   oh I preordered buttons too..oops. I'm not gonna lie I'm so excited about those dolls that I am Completely Awake now. THEY SERIOUSLY DO it kills me. Limiting myself to wedding theme for my victuuri ita had helped but Now I wanna do a phichit one rip. (whispers) phichit for best boy. I woke up from nightmares so it was a good distraction ; u;. LMFAO thank u for the well wishes. Good luck w your pile of yoi merch . the good thing with buying from a popular series is if u are full of regrets it's easier to resell things. gorgeous. I'm sorry it's just this is like the fourth time he's done this he just gets me so so SO frustrated. Also while waiting on zine things from three different shipping companies expect some angry mail tweets . Ohh!! At least the charms arrived safely ; u;. Is that starting from the preorder end date?I'm going to be away for a 2 weeks from middle to end of May so just tryin to figure. I'll dm you. When the AA map goes out u know shits getting real . aaah good luck! yeah sign ups were hell TT A TT.  Buttons for the Born to Make History zine are in! Artwork by the amazing @danibonbonbon and @birries     http:// born-to-make-history-zine.tumblr.com   pic.twitter.com/3CQVh9to8k. yes!!! . thank you again for making the design!! I adore it.  shdnjfd young attractive waiter was like "hi you look a little lost" while I was trying to judge if the seat was too far up . drag them to AB and try to sell there so you don't have to ship . mom: Not to make you sad but --
me: JOKE'S ON YOU, I'M ALREADY SAD. LRT I'm gonna post the group order in the morning so let me know ASAP if you want to reserve one! There's also a Yurio doll if u go to form. JUST SAYIN If u only want 1 doll or a mis-matched pair of dolls this is the way to save on shipping/possibly get extra goodies! . BUT DONT be RECKLESS I'm sorry to tempt you, just wanna give you the best opportunity if you do wanna make a bad decision ;). stay strong. I know...I..............really want........ four but I hate myself that's so much $. NO PRESSURE BUT... lemme know by like...... 8 AM EST ((around when I'll post publicly)) LOL. I KNOW WHY ARE THEY SO CUTE like victuuri is otp but phichit is best boy and LOOK AT YURIO'S HAT (Sorry guang-hong I still <3 u). AND HIS HAMSTER HAT. THIS IS A GARBLED TWEET MESS but it may have meant 'omfg no i won't buy it i'm too broke' (Y/N?). DON'T APOLOGIZE I can order any amount so it really doesn't matter too much!!! Just wanted to offer to friends + followers :). I TOTALLY understand (rip my wallet..this will be my last purchase ......... until new YoI merch comes out like 2moro CURSE THEM ). omg i'm so sorry I don't mean to cause you a crisis really. AAHH DO YOU ALSO DO THAT?? KEEP IT OPEN TO TORMENT/CONSTANTLY REMIND YOURSELF UNTIL U EITHER BUY IT OR CRY OR BOTH. just lemme know in the next like..7 hours cause certain characters only have 2 slots left already bc fellow friends are thirsty). and based off my previous experience with that group they will probably fill quickly. You can always order from the artist yourself any time until their preorder closes tho so don't antagonize yourself too much <3. lrt unbelievable. petition for YoI to stop making new merch. 2nd petition for me to gain some self control. on a more serious note it's hard bc after being poor for so long it feels so good to treat yourself but at the same time that. guilt gnaws at you :') and its not like i've gone crazy but it's just more than I used to be able to so it feels bad. THIS IS THE STORY OF MY Life I have done this to myself so many times. it's so hard w/ artists LOL SOME R REALLY FINICKY WITH THEIR STORES/don't pick dates (lookin at u mo*kie i <3 ur art but u kill me). ahh I didn't get those! they're so cute tho!! <3 1 friend in the group order is selling their preordered stuff to pay for more merch. ME TOO but I did get....inheritance ..which is really miserable but I try to fill the void with merch :') /gettign real. having a store open always is a pain tho. OMIGOD I DIDNT KNOW THAT THAT IS AMAZING!!! I got to the post office way too often. OHHH MAYBE I'M thinking of smth else????? are they..lemme get a pic. like the plush ones like this?  http:// st.cdjapan.co.jp/pictures/l/03/ 42/NEOGDS-216953.jpg   ….

LRT SMOL MAKKACHIN THEY ARE LITERALLY TRYING TO KILL ME. SAME WTF. THIS IS A NIGHTMARE I DONT WANNA SPRND ANOTHER $60 ON THIS VICTOR NENDOROID BUT DO U SEE HIM DO U SEE HIS LITTLE FACE. I WAS 85% SURE THIS WOULDNT BE A PROBLEM FOR ME BUT NOW IM ---. The past few mornings there's been this gross burn-y noxious smell in my room and only my room and I don't understand but it's probably bad. surprise mail is best mail. LRT BEAUTIFUL SAPPY PHOTOS OMIGOD. It happened a month ago+I stopped using my air purifier+it stopped so I thought that was the cause but now it's back and I'm ??? MM probably slowly poisoning myself but I need to sleep so I guess we'll find out later  . (whispers) don't remind me. At least I go to a school where they make it a point to try to cut tuition - ours went down recently. meanwhile my bro went to a $60k a year Ivy League :') mine is 6x less but I'll have more debt bc he got so much in scholarships . idk why but a point I've seen made is it incentivizes poor people to join the military (they'll pay for ur schooling after) . (I don't think that's why in general but it's still a reason some people join the army and that's kinda fucked up). UNBELIEVABLE. INEXCUSABLE. I FEEL PERSONALLY ATTACKED. working on it ;). @ meyoco_  1/3? hey meyo~I saw someone selling one of your sold out zines on eBay   I'm just curious how u feel abt it?? It's like they bought. 2/3 it so they can do whatever but it always feels weird when I see ppl reselling artists work, esp if that thing was sold out. 3/3 (like people grabbing popular tix just to resell).  I know, I discussed this with Jeanne (about France's college tuition) once and it was a really stark difference. good luck! THE CLEAR ANSWER IS: WHATEVER IS EASIER YOUVE GOT TWO HOURS GOGOGOGO . SWEATS I know Bishounen Con is .. REALLY SOON. Lrt ah Yurio looks really cute here ! sure! I'll find it again when I get home. POMPOMS!!!!!   I'll be putting some of my charms on these for cons! pic.twitter.com/m6K7plWHrW. mm I was gonna put em on yoi ones mostly but I can put em on whatever!! I only have these colors tho.

I saw someone reselling a charm of mine with others of the same character. It's a weird feeling. I feel like it's differen. if they don't want it any more then I'd rather it go to a good home vs the trash but with your sold out book it feels ..sleazier. I'm never buying anything ever again GDI pic.twitter.com/UAt5QxzA3D. hnnn I feel bad that my brother is going to have to see more things he wants of my grandmas go to my uncle than I will since my mom will. get the traditionally feminine things and my uncle the traditionally masculine things :\ JUST ANOTHER WAY GENDER ROLES FUCK PPL.

SO MANY GOOD ARTISTS GOING TO AB. casually sends client 3 AM email. is it less professional to make the client wait longer for a response or to send emails at absurd hours of the night ?? My hair is definitely changing color. I can't tell if I like it more or less? It wasdeep purple, now it's fading, pinker hues are coming out. the bottom where it's most faded is ALMOST the color I originally wanted tho so that's something . I also can't believe my pinched nerve is givin me trouble again after like 5 months of being ok when I have so much drawing to do this month. Sorry for all the late night ramblings . ahah yeah I figured - I'll be doing this. CAN I JUST SAY WINDOW SHADES SHOULDNT EXIST HOLY FUCK I HAD MY WINDOW OPEN EARLIER SO I PULLED IT BACK DOWN BEFORE CRAWLING IN BED. AND MINJTED LATER JT JUST POPPED BACK UP THEN POPPED COMPLETELY OFF THE THING ANDFELL ON THE FLOOR AND IT WAS SO LOUD AND SCARY. I ALMOST CRIED IT STARTLED ME SO MUCH. I can't believe it's 70 today...in February...in New England. Ack!

(But thank you <3 <3 <3). YEAH If I recall correctly they did the BNHA lanyard (approximately 6,000 characters) in like two days. GOALS. YEP. ersigg guess I should answer the 4,000 emails about where the zine is bc no one  reads anything :'). it looks like it'll be a couple weeks later than anticipated but it's not the end of feb yet so why are all these ppl losin it.

Hnnn I know!!! It looks really functional but it's 4x as much :'). mm it's cute but SO PRICEY . YEAH. your stickers are pretty big 3" right?! Definitely reasonable to raise the price. can always do deals too i.e. $2 or 3/$5. LMFAO I KNOW BUT WHERE AM I GONNA PUT THE THINGS. buttons I can put around the straps but keychains????????? CLEVER or like a cute ribbon or smth..thank u. a masterpiece. they're still huge tho! I don't think $2 is unreasonable for stickers that size even if they aren't waterproof. do you make them yourself? I can recommend a great printable adhesive waterproof material!! I love how that's not even the shape of the bag. ohh!! I see! yeah, the material I use (Waterproof vinyl) is for inkjet printers. but the same company offers some laser printer friendly options that may work!  http://www. texascraft.com/hps/home.php  . they also just have a clear overlaminate that waterproofs!!

THANK YOU @daikonhime  & @hawberries  for having me !   I was surprised and honored to be a part of this project with y'all ~ ☆. aww :( that's ok! You gotta take care of yourself!... I .. did this from 4:30 pm - 2 am w minimal breaks yesterday . I just realized..there's no one else at this carnival...maybe they went on like..a Monday.. Don't draw til 2 am, kids. so /that's/ why he's looking so happy!   hahahaha (thank you!!!). I only saw a clip of the new tangled show but the voice actress didn't say EUugene and idk how to feel . asd (whispers) wahh told ya to ask earlier orz   wahhh well we'll be sure to pop by a bunch! if ya need anything let us know!! . Hannah what's your name on the vendor list ? oh derf your name was right next to it   oh well you're not very far!! :). YESdefinitely!! They have a section on the app so   next time for sure!! I would've written u if I hadn't submitted already. you are the last person I would expect to say this. ganbare. you're welcome. update: cady played very nicely with three dogs of all ages and sizes yesterday! Not a single nip or noise~ she resets quickly. Ohh I hadn't! My bf grew up in the Philippines so we had a lot of this when he first came "you don't know what x is?!?? how?!". do you mind if I ask where u grew up? I'm not very worldly, just curious :o. ohh!! I meet so many pinoys on the internet! Mm except my bf grew up very comfortably.. oh! I didn't mean it in a "you're depriv. ed!" Way, only that I had to stop our conversation and show him what I was referencing often at first! yeah no I see how that wouldn't be ok. I just hadn't realized just how many pop culture references I make before him . YES I totally understand that.Sorry if I made you uncomfortable, as I typed it I was reassessing15 y/o me like'is this ignorant'. I THOUGHT THESE WERE GONNA BE SMALL BUT THEY ARENT SEND HELP omg so beautiful tho the only official merch on my bag pic.twitter.com/MGj0h6RI84. OMG same .. i also reference a lot of SNL skits that didn't achieve popularity so that's hard ahahaha. or like anime refs/trope refs when some of the people I'm closest too don't watch it. omg yes at first my boyfriend was always lamenting his lack of maids and drivers here and I was just like '..you had...what..'. rdhfgih this all sounds so nice! I really lament how I didn't grow up with more culture in my life?Or even a real /neighborhood. since I bounced around so much. Even tho we're not rly religious I appreciate that I was raised Jewish + know a chunk of the. customs+traditions (tho I've forgotten nearly all my Hebrew but counting and 'ice cream' haha) It's nice to have smth like that! I wanna have kids 1day + tho I dont wanna force religion on em I def want to teach em some   customs. ..and subject them to bits of random yiddish my grandma left me with <3 haha. well that's more households than I know here with maids lol Yeah apparently he had a driver who'd bring him to the mall + wait? yeah,, definitely!! I wish I persisted a bit more, I feel some of the knowledge is slipping away a bit :'). omg my dog just saw my neighbor/landlord outside + loves him but now she's in + she doesn't recognize him w a hat i guess she's YELLINGlmfao. mm! my boyfriend brings up jeepneys a lot too. is Orange good?? should I watch it?? My moms using the cat print packing peanuts for back support..I don't think that's what they meant by recyclable  pic.twitter.com/c0A3PHhT9W. a little over 2"! Which isn't /insane/ but I imagined them at 1.5" for some reason. if you ever wanna get wrecked just watch Your Name followed by Your Lie in April. I told cady we could cuddle but she snuggled so close that there's no room for my elbow // to move to draw!!  pic.twitter.com/hRuJsLpoqF. can I just say The Fr*y has a few really good songs and idk why but I feel like people are generally negative abt them?? yea I get that. The couple really popular ones were played to death but I like some others too like Heartbeat & All At Once. I got up to plug in my charger and before I could get set back up she pulled this move on my lap pic.twitter.com/OcyRM52FbO. yeah I mean they do but..I like the sound so lmfao. yesss u vu .

I'd love to see your jirachi too if you end up making one!! :O. I HATE DAYLIGHT SAVINGS NOW IM GOING TO BED AT FOUR INSTEAD OF THREE i AM so. sdgrhutrit i love lorde's music a lot. Aaa I'm so excited for Monday bc people will probably start receiving the zine then   I hope they post pics!! I'm thinking we'll probably send digital ones out to customers (and artists) on Monday too but will discuss w co-organizers. Shdkfkal I'm so frustrated. There's lots of great and sentimental things and my mom is going to get a lot of them, but the only thing /I/. specifically request from my grandma's is this silly little iron outline of a horse that's been resting over the doorframe in. the kitchen forever+ u never even realize it's there+I almost just took it 1day bc I thought no one would notice/care butdidn't. And apparently that's "the one thing" my uncles wife wants..and like that's nice but she was /my/ freaking /grandma/ + she died. the least I can ask for is this goddamn horse. But since my mom is getting a lot of the furniture I can't argue for it and. i know it's just an object but it's making me pretty miserable. @unagicakee aa thanks you two u my after writing I got upset/cried to my mom+she was unhappy w how my uncle just like Claimed things. @unagicakee for his party w/o leaving room for discussion (I know she's been feeling this way abt other things too). @unagicakee so she's gonna bring it up again. legally she has the last say but i don't want it to come to that/I wouldn't over the . shsndj right like ok u lived with her (against her wishes) for a year but I grew up in that place so heck off. no he's just an awful human being TBH (got us $10k in debt, faked cancer once, etc) so I WANT THIS ITS MINE is just his personality. most of what my mom got was furniture but it was more bc he didn't want it than him comprising/splitting equally. he was like "the silver is going to mydaughter" right off the bat1.No 2. U don't get 2 decide on ur own!?!Have a conversation,Jesus. ahdkfks sorry to ramble   thank you for listening tho . Jennie@sad & salty "Grandma-why-didn't-you-make-a-will" tweets. shrhjddn hes very $$$ oriented so   I mean it was his parents tho so I'd hope he at least cares about some of the things that way. ashdg I'm sorry that must b so frustrating! When looking@ schools only a few had /Illustration/ programs vs design/visual/fineart. Lrt I'm not entirely sure what's going on there but it looks really cool // intriguing ! IT TODAY. Please post pics so my anxious heart will relax and see that yes - it did make it to people safely LMFAO.

PHEW ok now that merch deadlines have passed for AB.......midterm PROJECT??? CLEAN MY ROOM?FREEDOM?!

Some printers provide one tho. post on tumblr or twitter with a link to a google form :). HAHAHAH BUT U ENJOYED IT.  omg that's so sweet!! There's others interested and we have to sell my gma's house I really hope we can finagle smth. had an open house at my grandmas today and it will def go fast so I'm hoping things fall into place. we weren't going to look yet but I happened to see it on again + we had looked at it in December and it felt like fate wahhh. omg this is a good motivation tool LMFAO. Omg the waiter saw the full range of my emotions (happily jamming and singing > crying ) + my mom goes "she's back to normal" and I choked. I still adore this <3. THE REALTOR COMPLIMENTED US she said she wants to sell it to us...........WE'LL SEE IF SHE STIL FEELS LIKE THAT AFTER THE CONTINGENCY /hit. TT A TT She called me sweet and said the owners would like us guguu. HNN SORRY I SHOULD BE DRAWING??? IM GONNA TRY TO DO THAT.. A DISTRACTION. I wanna announce smth else cool too but i gotta wait. omg why is he on the floor u ok victor. ...MM... MY SARA LOOKS MORE ..Middle-Eastern or Indian > ITALIAN but I dont wanna white wash her skin tone  Send help. It's hard bc I'm like 'what makes someone look Italian' but I also don't wanna operate on stereotypes..even if I am part Italian LOL. MM ZINE PIECE IS STRESSIN ME SO IM DRAWING NAHO. this is brilliant!!! WHEEZES I misinterpreted this but it gave me a good idea!! I STILL WANNA SEE THIS HAPPEN THO. Oh shit y'all I just had a good idea. oh no I don't need more things to do but I kinda wanna do this...it could be really low-key. You guys. I need all the good vibes you can muster. We're putting in an offer on our dream house but there's another offer in. We'll be offering a bit more $ but the contingency (of selling my grandma's house bc it'll fund this purchase) may turn them off. and make us lose it bc my FUCKINGN UNCLE won't show my grandma's house again til Tuesday/we don't know if there's any offers in. bc the realtor doesn't acknowledge my mom and won't answer since it's Easter . I already cried about it like five times my mom + I are normally indecisive people but we feel so strongly abt the house pls orz. rip.  THANK U. a poll. THANK YOU . all my zine ideas lately are kinda gimmicky but maybe it's cute idk.  thank you! Gonna have to suffer til sometime Monday anyways orz. Should I write a letter to go with the offer ... I don't know if it would make a difference but.. LMFAO I WROTE A FULL PAGE LETTER TO SUBMIT WITH OUR OFFER....SHE WAS A SCHOOL TEACHER SO SHE BETTER APPRECIATE THIS. wheeze..the font is kinda big but they're 80 so.. DFGJIFH I'VE MADE MY TWITTER FRIENDS SUFFER ENOUGH but thank you . Sorry for the haphazard graphic/tumblr but I'm running a quick digital charity zine! Open for submissions! Info@ https:// kissing-booth-zine.tumblr.com/post/159648857 372   … pic.twitter.com/aEAmEZAeFL. yep it's just blank! :). I just made it so that they're all the same size to easily assemble~. RTs appreciated . @ZineAppCalls hi there! I have  zine with open submissions! It is my pinned post :) thank you! We're meeting w the realtor tomorrow morning to put in the offer and hopefully she'll show them later in the day . Should I finish that no.6 drawing from a year and a half ago. I'm dying someone told me to give up . IM FUCKING LOSING IT WE GET HOME AND MY MOMS LIKE IS THAT A SKUNK AND IM LIKE IS THAT A PENGUIN AND MY MOMS LIKE IS THAT OUR DOG. CADY GOT OUT. SHE WAS JUST LAYING DOWN NEAR THE MAILBOX. THE DOORS BLEW OPEN. BOTH OF THEM. AND SHE LET HERSELF OUT. AND SHE DIDNT LEAVE TO GO TO THE PARK OR TRY TO CROSS THE MAIN FUCKING STREET WE LIVE ON IDK IF SHE WAS OUT THERE FOR 2 MINUTES OR 2 HOUrS. SDIHFGIRDTHDTYH  okay. I've calmed down a bit but jesus. a close call. she's such a good girl. YEAH SHES TOTALLY FINE. IF IT WAS DAYTIME I HAVE NO DOUBTS THAT SHE WOULDVE TRIED TO GO TO THE PARK AND GOTTEN HIT BY A CAR. SHE ALMOST GOT HIT BY THE CAR /WITH ME/ THE OTHER DAY SO IT.D EFINITELY WOULDVE BEEN BAD. what a good girl...oh my god.. shes was just laying there. next to our driveway. I mean we would've seen + looked for her but she was RIGHT THERE WHEN WE PULLED IN. Like we didn't even park we pulled in and she was in our headlights. Yeah :') Gonna have to..start locking the door?? The problem is more that it doesn't close well. Also my mom left second #notmyfault. omg I adore this idea . Hahahaha the house thing isn't going well. I'm gonna die. It's not going well. I made the realtor cry . THIS IS A GOOD THING THO IT DOESNT SOUND LIKE IT. I read a story where this person sealed the deal on a house by adopting the owners cat . I wrote an emotional letter abt the house and it made her cry   there's another offer so if she vouches for us it's good. Dndjsjbshs it sounds like if we throw them enough $ it may work out bc they're hurting for it and I want them to retire well. yeah!!! . they were sucked in by one of those do it yourself things old people are susceptible to and this heartless bastard tied them. into a YEAR contract + told them to drop the price to the point they would've had to PAY MONEY TO SELL THEIR HOUSE i feel awful. agsj it's still really up in the air tho..I hope the other people aren't willing to pay a stupid amount like us (it needs work). omg it really is cute. mmm anyone have cute swimwear shop recs? I could really use one more that actually fits LOL.. Shhhshs so they didn't reject us but. They're doing best & final offers . aka a GUESSING GAME sobbing. DSFGISJDGH OK SO. THEY ACCEPTED OUR OFFEr.

SORRY I DIDNT EXPLAIN THAT WELL AT ALL BUT I feel like you get what I mean;;. omg this metaphor. I'm not very religious so even if I say pray I mean more like 'sending you good vibes!!' ... I guess I should write that but it's way longer. YEAH NO if people say it that way it's really rude and condescending!!! >:(. I watched a video about sex workers and this girl was like 'my family is 'praying for me'' and another girl went 'I'M BEING PRAYED FOR TOO!'. !!! I love Chii!!

'hello yes u look familiar but no walks in past 5 minutes so goodbye' - Cadence, probably. I was about go outside at sunset but I passed out and it was 5 hours later and anyways i'm never flying overnight again if I can help it. I'm trying really hard to pretend Akon doesn't exist rn. YEs if I don't lose my mind (3 countries and 8 flights in the past 3 weeks  ). The dog walker spoiled this thing so much. I'm trying to get ready to walk her and she's just sitting on the couch crying abt not being out. oh god don't say that med...idk what I wanna make but I'll def take you up on that sometime...

I don't like..drinks?..alcohol, coffee, tea, -- even hot chocolate is a struggle to get down. Black and white frappes are the only exception. I really enjoy being in the water but I can't swim properly...more of a doggy paddler bc i hate putting my face in while swimming.. I can make a piggy sound..I don't really know how to describe it but I don't think it's uncommon. LOL NOT A SQUEAL... like oinking? with my tongue and roof of my mouth and throat?????????.......................soundsweird. I HELD A BABY ALPACA ON VACATION DONT TELL U.S. IMMIGRATION... photo evidence to come but it's on my borther's phone. (softly) I was supposed to go back and try for light purple but I really like being blonde. .........I like some country music......i'm sorry. I almost cried in a parking lot today bc I couldn't decide which delicious food I wanted for dinner after three weeks abroad. country music gets such a bad rep..and like there are songs that are super sexist or generic abt trucks/boots/etc. but THERES GOOD STUFF TOO. NO I REALLY WANTED FOOD FROM TWO PLACES AND COULDN'T DECIDE WHICH TO GET AND GOT DISPROPORTIONATELY STRESSED.

Ok I have decided to try not to spiral too much abt eating fried junk + sleeping late and to instead spend the day chilling and taking care. of myself (taking a walk, using the healing stuff on my hair that takes a while, drawing), sprinkling in a few responsibilities. smh whatever it's only a minor inconvenience. Some r wrapped better than others but here's gifts for fam/friends   So many beautiful things down there, wish I could spoil ev1 more!+tapir pic.twitter.com/IPYPDxM0bF.

When we moved in I thought about painting my room (we're renting...) and so there's a blue splotch covered up by a birthday card ..sorry Tim. My nose pretends it's cute on the outside, but inside it's deviated as fuck. I always think about changing my business cards and never do. I still haven't watched Koe no Katachi bc I'm scared of CRYING A LOT. I think Miss Cadence is growling in her sleep. Earlier she got spooked so badly by a snake.. She would cringe and run from slight shuffling of leaves, certain sticks   poor boo. I'll be at A-kon Table 1721 @AkonArtistAlley  this weekend!

It is 3 pm and I haven't gotten out of her but I am DETERMINED TO NOT BE SICK so I am resting HARD. *out of bed... Looking at my uncles bank statement makes me feel a lot better about our vacation spending. (softly) I saw some people are upset but I thought it was funny............... (he asked my mom to explain where his money went [narrator: he spent it], I didn't obtain it in any sort of suspicious way). ; ). Me: what's the temperature 
Mom: mm it's pants
....... Now I'm having runny nose and watery eyes but I didn't get up until like an hour ago and Benadryl makes me pass out.. ohmygod. * U* Looks nice!! A happy accident! i live in a pile of used tissues now. this is my fate. i accept it. ,mmm the headcold fuzziness is starting to sink in. I saved a file as 'face'. It was not a drawing of a face. how does one draw whipped cream. other thanthat i'm pretty satisifed withthis sprry for typos my nose isurninng + i dont care. y'all better eat this up (pun intended) i think it's super cute. ..my nose or the whipped cream? PFthhah. love the pink ice cream snake+what you did w/ the variations on the cone! Something about the ramen one tho.seems slightly too muted to me? weeps I see! greens can be tricky   It still looks nice tho! i'm super sick but SO ARE MY DRAWINGS (aka I'm at the bad part of this headcold already but my drawings are going really well???? GOOD???). is tamako market good should i watch it. ohm y god that should be a kickstarter reward. I haven't actually watched much kyoani stuff! I could use cute right now tho! (softly) let me throw money at you. Local dog cannot support own head. Tragic. pic.twitter.com/EhYCXE42B6. why is yuuri 7000 easier to draw than victor for me. the only good thing about stuffy noses is i can hit high notes that are usually just out of reach LMFAOresgt. I just spent idk how long tryna fix v's face before saying 'fuck this' + switching tasks, then i banged out yuuri in two seconds rdishgf. ...stupid...handsome...long face.. me: this piece is almost done
me@me: but what about victor's face---
me: shhhhh. @ squigglegigs. (muffled screaming) his face is impossible. nailed it. pic.twitter.com/kcCDcSsMo5. ok i don't feel good but i'm gonna go on a walk and we'll see how dead i feel when i get back rioghth. new icon material. hnnn idk?! I feel like I usually draw an even mix of both but maybe bc I want Victor to be 'handsome' vs pretty or cute... y'all i'm so unprepared for a-kon it's not even funny. OH SHIT GUYS IM FINALLY OLD ENOUGH TO GO TO DRUNK SHAKESPEARE?!! I'm so stuffy that my cherry cough drops just taste like..salty or something..instead of yummy candy u nu. My flight is in like 16 hours I feel like shit and haven't packed. relatable tweets. drink a BUNCH of water. Vvvnngdcbkj I keep thinking about how screwed I am but don't feel well enough to get up and con prep/pack....why this. ah well I have a deviated septum so I have some stuff I take everyday for sinus swelling/pressure orz. when I get sick tho it exacerbates the problem and almost always gets infected cvfhnkl. yeah..I have to be on a plane in 12 hours /slinks into an abyss. Maybe I should skip Thursday..I guess I'll see how I feel u nu. no no I mean 12 hours from now I'll be on a plane (for 4 hours). Japan is 13 hours flying   someday... Cady keeps crying and I can't tell what's wrong or if she's just torturing me. update: she's ok she's just weird and keeps getting "stuck" places today (mentally stuck not physically  ). Skangelks fuck fuck fuck I just keep feeling worse now my stomach is acting up (/again/) and I feel really hot and I don't feel good fuck. I should've gone to the doctor today this was a mistake. Maybe I'll feel better in a day and be full of regret but also maybe I won't bc I won't sleep tonight, get on a plane, set up, etc etc. and maybe I'll feel worse and worse and be across the country in a strangers house or have to go to the emergency room. I am. Strongly considering calling it off. I don't want to take the easy way out but I feel. really awful. I think it's mostly a bug but it's a good one. I already did Machu Picchu w a stomach bug last week I can't keep doing this. There's another flight 2moro that costs same. Either way I don't feel good enough to go in 2 hrs so I'm gonna bite it/change fee. My stomach still isn't 100% which isn't good (more antibiotics?), Benadryl phase passed, other sinus meds give me bad reactions. yeah that's my worry...if it's exhausting at 100% then what's gonna happen if I start like this..ugh I'm so frustrated. like I'm feeling very lucky that we aren't struggling anymore and that it's not like "you have to go or we can't pay rent". but to not go still feels pretty awful bc it is losing money and I want to meet lots of people..uhhdnfjd sorry to ramble . abdfjsk yeah aside from migraines/pms I've never been sick sick before now orz oh how lucky we were. TT n TT weeps thank u for listening. I appreciate it even tho there's nothing either of us can do orz. I hope you're having fun in Germany! I'm glad you've been traveling too after the con!! djsjdndnd I know on top of not feeling good myself I'm like "no1 wants to be next to me on a plane or buying things I've touched. yes! Even within smaller countries there can be so much variation from place to place! djfndjdn omg I know my dog sitter only sent like a picture a week and it was torture LMFAO. I'm glad you were able to keep going and have a good time! I imagine the Extra stress of con/traveling alone can get to u. Chocolate!!! Plain chocolate! Milk chocolate... LmfAo I'm so picky really .. dndndjdhs don't be too hard on yourself! And seriously if I didn't know the dog watcher well I'd be freaking out too. they're your kids , of course you'd be worried!!! BAHDIEJS TBH Cady has a blast but I think she was mad at us for leaving so long. Charlie(dog watcher) waited til we got home bc he wanted to see her reaction (presumably excitement)+she would barely look at me. she literally sat up and yawned   but she's back to cuddling now. honestly he's a hyper little baby I'm sure he'll be fine. even Charlie said cadence has such a strong personality she /will/ let u kno she's /not in the mood/ . even everyday sometimes she'll rest her head on u/complain til u let her in the cuddle spot, others she's like "don't touch me". sjfjabsb if house stuff works out y'all could come and bring your doggos and swim in the lake and stay over even!! oh god..house stuff /looks into the distance why can't things be simple.. SHDNJS WELL ILL LET U KNO BY JULY 31 . Hey everyone. I was supposed to fly in to Dallas um..now but I'm  pretty sick. So i def won't be at Akon Thurs.Going to see how Fri goes. . ahhh good good!!! Either way when the weathers nice we could make a day trip or two up there to the beach~~. aaaa oh no! I just saw a list the other day of dog friendly / off leash beaches. I'll have to look into it! Boyfriend is determined not to change my contact photo in his phone from five years ago but I think I'm cuter now..tragic. Shdndj dolls from @AmeKung111 arrived but since Im sick I didn't answer the door and will have to wait another day to pick them up . Yikes. Looks like I'm moving on the coughing stage . Andnfjsj oh no!!! (Softly) disease is everywhere   Feel better and don't push yourself too hard !! Me: I still feel awful I should prob just rest, not push myself to fly across the country, 9 hr work days
Also me:but @kohichapps  is there.. ajejdjsjns im dying. my lungs don't wanna be in my body anymore I can't convince them to stay. (Coughs on everything in the house)

Hgdgiu I didn't even take the medicine that dries out my nose and I'm getting nosebleeds. I'm sorry everyone. I'm so disappointed in the situation + myself but I can't keep pushing my body like this.  Gonna take a loss on this one pic.twitter.com/of78uwq8OL. Ugh this sucks. I just know if I did all that it would be awful and I'd feel even worse.  San Japan, my love ??

I've only been Duolingoing for 4 days but already I'll see a lil snippet of Japanese+even tho idk what it means sometimes I can sound it out. petition to let us attend cons together. yeah!!! you should!! We can add each other and track our progress too!!

DRGHJJ it doesn't stop me from repeating it half the time anyways LOL.

(softly) Can I second this?   I had a lot of fun in the artist alley this year!Good luck with your 2018 planning! (softly) but u can't turn tictail marketplace off and u can on storenvy if you so choose (which I don't  ). also can't integrate tictail with shippingeasy if u use that. ((not tryna counter you misty just throwing facts that may or may not affect the decision..ih8bothplatforms). She can't commit to coming up here???? pic.twitter.com/IR0ifAInPf.  every platform is awful and has its own unique downfalls . This is g o r g e o u s ! * Q*. wheeze I wanna set up a tictail cause they're prettier but i'm so spoiled w shippingeasy...also I already have etsy too..3 stores would be.. ohh @cencorolling  I was told it's ok to bring brownies to the cafe!!! So I'll prob be doing that unless I manage my time poorly;;. That's true! And I don't like Tictail's shipping either bc you can only have one category.. You know what I do like??? BIG CARTEL!! They have so many great graphs and dashboards and stuff!! .. but no shippingeasy integration again. also bigcartel costs $ per month if over 5 items orz ... everythnig is badesgrtsrhYFTJ. yeah.etsy isn't so bad tho it's .20 per listing for 4 months......I didn't make many sales there for a while but now there's more so it's ok. aaa yeah I wanna!! DECORATE!!! ... Any time I see someone's store and go 'it's so pretty' it's tictail! so smoll /boops them. Nope!! Etsy's is the above! Bigcartel is per month and it's like $9.99 for up to 25 items so hnnn. pssst @daikonhime  I sent you an email bc I made an oopsie / I'm an idiot .

SGIDJHTH I missed an amiami payment too I am so off the ball lately rsigrdh. twitter i'm gonna need youru opinon on a thing in aminute. I'll get better so I can meet youu~~~   . But really I should be better by then and hopefully the brownies come out well~!! hnn yeah I only bother making certain more popular designs now and only for certain cons. Some cons ban stickers too;;. Which of these should I make clear pouch designs? (Can't find photo - like pvc/plastic w sliding zip on top [horizontal]) Poll in replies! pic.twitter.com/0gLwJITcPc. Vote on design(s)!! aaa Thank you Kohi!! Your feedback is valuable!   It's not my fave drawing of all, but I do agree that I like it best in this application! Yes!!! tbh I'm.. pretty confused about when we're doing what/expected to be where. My only thing is I have friends in the first two blocks~. this month on: jennie repurposes art instead of drawing new things before the deadline :' ). ohhh I'll definitely give that a go!!!  Thank you!! I think it's just because I was rushed and was forced to print it before I felt "finished" (for school). Thank you!! Twitter agrees ;) I don't think I've ever run such a decisive poll!! Aaah thank you!! I've become so dependent on you guys that I can't recommend an online store platform you don't integrate w. wow!! What a great deal * O* I look forward to seeing what you create! LMFAO I DIDNT NOTICE THE DATE ON IT   Oh well, I certainly can relate to that.. Hebdhdns when someone says they have smth to ask u but don't ask it until u reply: anxiety level 100. I'm not sure but it just came out! Just saw the bottom part w baby yuri and yurio a few minutes ago. @ quelmdn  @ladyegcake  here! TT A TT They're really spoiling us with this content~  AHAHAH. aaa I meant like!! The content of the art (not necessarily the frequency of it) but you're right it's been drying up lately . better for my wallet this way tho' new merch every 2 days was killing meee. ahaha they're playing with our emotions~ . Day 10.....when will the grossness in my face be over. UHHH THIS IS SUPER FUCKING COOL. LRT IS SUPER COOL Y'ALL NEED TO SEE IT PLEASE WATCH THE VIDEO. ahh I haven't posted a couple of full zine pieces I'm allowed to show now :O
I'll do that!!! > :). I bet a lot of artists do feel that way! I don't really have any ideas right now so I'm happy doing AA and I really enjoy it!But it's a lot. I definitely see how it can take huge chunks of time away from working on other projects ; n;  even off con-season there is no rest. SERIOUSLY!!! I was like Ahh those are some nice illustrations then I saw the video and was like sGROTH !! I like the variety in actions too. ahhh I just got the app!! Super cool TT U TT (sorry I keep saying the same thing ahhaha). yea no that's definitely Not A Thing.even ppl who do that.there's a huge risk factor (abt people buying but also abt GETTING IN). it totally works!!! shsbdsbj a lot to ask these days . Lrt. Hey. That's shit. I HATE WHEN THAT HAPPENS!! I feel that way abt my Victor rn and I'm like "but his hair parts on the other side" . ohmygodplease.  this thread is a lot to handle. lrt A thing I'm in!!! They certainly did push the limits hahaha. my mom's always giving me shit for how often I wanna eat@this place (+ she did last night, when we went there) AND NOW SHE WANTS TONIGHT. (Swats at another pouch design) I can't get this dang thing right. Not having a SIM card has made me hyper aware of just how many fast food places I'm already linked to the wifi at . when will people accept that the only thing that should be used as lube is lube. why is it so difficult for my dog to get keep her legs on the couch... her lil tootsies are always sticking out into the air :P.

Even when their proof shows it??? Help. weeps I don't think they even know what they want .

Nah, I mostly wanted Phichit so I'll skip it :') I'll have luck one of these days! Thanks anyways;. SNORTS I mistyped my name 'Jenni' + was reminded of my short-lived modeling career as a toddler (My mom did that so it'd be 'memorable').

Cady is still acting weirdly..I don't really know what to do about it bc it's not like she's not eating, drinking, etc she just seems..off. I WISH I COULD HELP U BUT ITS VINTAGE   which is why it's too small but I got it anyways bc that was the Only Option.

I can't believe either of these things.......maybe I should blog again since good things happen . Pfff I don't have the time but i scrolled thru and it made me nostalgic .. it was really bizarre . @unagicakee p sure they made this w u in mind. (soflty) he's awful but I love him .. At cons, people tend to either REALLY LIKE or REALLY HATE him...There are few people in between;;. I love that he has no tragic backstory. Like it's completely unjustifiable. everyone just told him he was amazing and he became this way . suffering yet another death at the hands of your beautiful merch <3 <3 <3. pic.twitter.com/VCBN2rx6KY.

Anyways I'm in NY for three days and I packed like 8 shirts I'm so confused from our 20 day trip.. I think my anxiety of being unprepared contributes to my overpacking. it's supposed to be in the 80s all weekend and I packed 4 sweatshirts and a sweater pls fix my brain. LIKE EVERYTHING IS THIS HOUSE IT BECAME INSTANTLY BURIED. I think she wanted not to forget them so she put them under her purse but it ended up delaying us like 15 mins .

People will ask u about the other persons prints and you'll have to explain/send them over and that's not cool. well I guess it depends on table spacing.

Super cute and wig/brows are spot on!! i'm dyin we took a personality test and my level of cautiousness (out of 100) is 97 and my boyfriend's is 1   two extremes. My dog probably hates me she barks to warn abt the neighbors and I'm just cooing at her that she's so brave + I like her Mohawk (raised fur). It's hard to remember that some people like desserts that aren't literally just chocolate. seconded! also heard good things abt this brand and used it in the past! Lrt I would play a game w those backgrounds just bc of them. 42% funded, 12 days left!!   getting cloosserrrr... oh my goodness   it was funny from the start but i lost it at "I have reservations". lrt where is kinokuniya nyc / jersey artist alley, HUH. @cencorolling no no They just jumped on it to sponsor it, it was happening before they were involved. Hence  , "co-sponsor". what midi said /too lazy to reply to multiple tweets. true!!! There's no space for it there tho..

As of last nights Life is Strange decisions, we don't have a gun to defend ourselves /and/ I didn't let her steal the cash to pay Frank so. those were good moral decisions (don't shoot someone, don't steal) but I probably totally fucked us right.... ..having a drug dealer after you bc u tried to shoot him and committing a crime are also bad tho ..this game's a nightmare. @unagicakee. tfw u write to five places and only the most expensive one writes u back. mm I wish I was more.........charming???? Or like..hm. I don't know.I just get embarrassed and shut down and garble words and stuff. like when meeting new people (depending on the circumstances). Ahh glad to hear that! + that someone else didn't compromise their morals :') EVEN THO MAYBE IT SCREWS Us..WE'LL SEE I'm only in  ep3. lrt even the bakery I worked at was like YEP BAKED FRESH and I was like uh if you mean baked then frozen for up to 2 weeks then yeah, fresh. Sometimes someone would be like my party is in x days is it too soon? so I'd get them one outta the freezer and tell them to freeze it. until like 12 hours before the party and they were always like ???!?!? So startled. There's SO much food waste as it is but I can't even imagine the gross amounts we'd throw out w/o freezing..or you'd have to bake like 2 so. you know they'd sell and wouldn't be a waste of ingredients/time/food and people would be mad when they didn't have 5000 options. Gold or gunmetal? SNORT  the email box was full so I mailed this place thru FB and FB is like 'it typically takes them a week or more to reply'. Placing this order in a couple hours so last chance .

I have had several people ask me to draw Iida - he's brushed aside a lot so I'm sure people are excited to see him! /wipes your tears . THANK YOU taiyaki nyc has been on my mind since I didn't get to go, then this weeks ep and @unagicakee reinforced it! Hahah. I kissed Chloe so I really hope we end together and not freaking Warren. he's nice but I'm 2 busy solving a missing person case to go to he movies+he still buys me a ticket? Boy,take no for an answer . also pool scene was adorable . ..well I guess a love life should be the least of my worries..gotta focus on not letting a tornado wipe out the town .

Lrt I GET SO ANXIOUS ABT ALL THE PLASTIC PACKAGING IN MY HOUSE   I try to recycle them for sticker packs and recycle mailers when I have. bump cause I already buried it with life is strange tweets . people were initially comparing yoi to killing stalking and I don't think you can get too much more off-base than that.

He also can never be inconvenienced so it's hard to show it . BUT MEANWHILE WE WORKED OUT A DEAL W THE HOUSE WE'RE BUYING and we can move in August 19th!!! WHICH IS SOON.not soon enough for. my bro to get to live in it/help me clean the lake/make stairs, but like shit I gotta start packing?!

Even if I didn't mail yours out yet I made sure to set aside everything to be mailed on Monday! I should probably close it to keep my sanity but .. I've been making more sales lately so it seems a shame to close it... orz. alright y'all I promise I'm not tryna sell u with this tweet I just am genuinely super pleased w how comfy this shirt is?! like I am terribly picky abt clothing comfort (too tight, bunches up, limited range of arm motion, etc.) but I wore 1 all day w/o any issues. snagged @KomunHorangi  's last kiri charm bc I WASN'T GONNA FUCK UP AGAIN (missed tsuyu-chan  ). can't believe I'm deadass in the middle of the room at this con sandwiched between two 10ft tables TT A TT;; NEIGHBORS ARE AMICABLE THO. ITS SUCHA  SMALL ROOM IT DOESNT REALLY MATTER BUT I FEEL A LITTLE TRAPPED SOMEHOW HAAHh. up to 2 months is very reasonable for smth like charms (2 weeks preorder, x weeks production+shipping). if it's something really unique w a longer production time or something handpainted/made then longer would be acceptable for me!  y'all are too cute.  ..  !! TFW you're trying to decide between two outfits then deadass drop some shorts in the toilet. WISH I HAD MAX'S REWIND POWER RIGHT ABOUT NOW.. not my best work .

Looks like there were a few skirmishes but overall fairly peaceful. Seems like the Boston Police were very prepared. TFW randos tweet at u for even mentioning the rally. we didn't have nazis march w torches + murder someone so I'm gonna call that a win  bye. Aaa, thank you for the support!!  Hope you're having a great time at the con! yes!!! It's only a second year but it's been busier than anticipated!   Meeting lots of great people too. not me but I kno lots of ppl who did!!

Rough. I didn't know a prof could kick you out of their class just bc they decided you couldn't catch up,.who the fuck is she to decide. I...only go part time..I'm..probably going to lose all my scholarships now....she didn't even discuss it what the fuck.  who knows.. I'll. Figure something out I guess...fuck. no it was definitely intentional . Sjnfjddjs I should have gotten in touch with disability services sooner but it was so busy w the move, harder as a commuter, etc. also it's so frustrating you have to do it Every Semester like I'm not suddenly Totally Fine it should carry over.. dfsgijh Thank you ; n; Yeah I'm still not convinced that's a thing but..... I'm gonna get in touch with my advisor/disability services. YEAH I was. not aware this was a thing. Also she literally wrote You can't catch up you've been dropped and didn't respond to anything I. wrote about my situation or getting in touch with disability services or anything. Not even "I'm sorry but" or "I understand but". I even tried to meet with her outside of class and teachers are literally REQUIRED to have office hours but she insisted she couldn't. Right like even if I failed the class (and I wasn't at that point..) isn't it..my choice to fail it? dgsfj yeah I explained to her but she didn't give a fuck and totally ignored everything I wrote, even about disability services. I specifically wrote "I do not want to drop this class" . Rest in pIECES. Add/drop ended but I'm gonna email my art history teacher from last year and be like y.yo..she was really nice but idk if it's even possible. She suddenly decided it was impossible for me to catch up even tho she was waiving the 1st day project (lots of people switch after day 1). and I told her I'd bring the other project to her next class.. Sent! Pray for me and the thousands of dollars I don't have if she doesn't do me a favor . It's definitely not in there......Yeah I emailed a prof abt another class to see if she's willing to have me, then email advisor/disability. me: I've had anxiety and migraines for over a decade

Anyways I found these buildabear sunglasses pic.twitter.com/JCz2nIwNvL. What a snazzy outfit (pls don't RT I'm almost done) pic.twitter.com/kRJhoh7E01. $0 in sales  
I feel like I've got an Elton John vibe goin here tho . Relatable pic.twitter.com/PJKpJXjvUh. except it's these good boys pic.twitter.com/oME2vugAIi. Indeed!! I soaked it in water overnight since I want to use it for coasters and it's pretty damn tough!! Will be using it soon~. Cady's hobbies include biting her own feet and staring wistfully out at the lake pic.twitter.com/tunIMKP8nq. MMM My lower back hurts and my front feels bloated and if I get my period the day we're in the car for hours and I can't use a heating pad I will be one unhappy camper.. u nu same to you /pats
HAH. ALRIGHT THIS IS NEVER GONNA WORK BUT Y'ALL I'M NOT HECKIN AROUND -- If anyone is able to find Kirishima nitotan in the dealer's hall at #animenyc  I will give you anything your heart desires (plus the $ for him obviously - pls bring receipt or price tag!) Please bring my son home. (softly) the plush version I mean but I actually don't have the hero version of the rubber strap so I'll give you a little something for that HAHA. Update ok now I have it the day I'm supposed to back everything I don't know if this is better. Slowly cooking my abdomen on this heating pad bc of course it's A Bad One..I have a theory that one ovary is a problem bc it is roughly every other time better and worse. Anyone ever use a tens machine? In a lull right now but I've been in bed and sobbing bc of pain..hasn't been this bad in almost a year. Ok cool so I woke up feeling bad, got my period right after eating, laid down in bed and experienced moderate pain with waves of intense pain for three hours, finally it stopped and I dozed off for two hours and now it's 8 pm. Super ready to leave for Anime NYC . I think a reason why I don't cosplay so much is bc it's I know I'll never be great at it and I don't like feeling subpar? Like I care abt cosplay but my passion is stronger elsewhere so I know I'll never devote as much to it as others do and get that much better. Hi there! I will be selling at table F6 in the artist alley! You can view my work on  http:// cambrasine.wixsite.com/portfolio    and items I'll be selling at  http:// cambrasine.storenvy.com    :). Yep! I may not have everything that's listed on my storenvy but I will most of it - like 90% - plus some things that aren't on there yet! \o/. I'm feeling a lot better but I'm tired from the debacle ; n; Gonna do my best tho.. I don't wanna get to NY at midnight tomorrow aaa. [RT Appreciated, I died for this]
TALK ABOUT LAST MINUTE - Finally finished up this Big 3 print for #AnimeNYC  Booth F6 this weekend! 
Online at  http:// cambrasine.storenvy.com      
I LOVE THESE KIDS SO MUCH and I plan to cosplay Nejire-chan  pic.twitter.com/vaHTbrn4rC. ahhaa More like I decided to make prints of some pieces I hadn't printed before!   I wanted to make an anime NYC exclusive postcard or something but I ran out of time orz. PS With or without text? Poll in replies pic.twitter.com/AF9rEPbcZr. Which version? (Without text image in replies). THANK YOU!! I had help in AANI today with sizing it haha. ALSO SHOUTOUTS to Kat, Kayla, and Yinyin in AANI for giving me anatomy and text guidance!! .  Thank you!! I worked hard on it! THANK YOU SO MUCH!! Yes I had a rare moment where the color palette I started with remained unchanged! Just felt right :). AA THANK U SO MUCH!!   Hope to see you soon ! . (Softly) your art looks really familiar why was I not already following you?!! HOLY HECK THATS RARE WANNA TRADE?! . My school has this mandatory required sexual assault and bystander intervention online course and these kids in class were talking about how u can literally click thru it and not watch a single video and that made me squirm. Especially after all the celebrity reports lately like..you aren't safe..and don't you wanna do smth if you can help someone else?! What's wrong w y'all. YEAH....and like it was two ladies and a gay guy and like no offense but y'all aren't demographics who should feel super confident. Like yeah online courses and these videos can be cheesy and unhelpful but maybe you'll learn one tiny little nugget of info that will make a difference one day literally it takes like half an hour or smth. Yessss! If you don't fiddle a ton at the end it means you did something right . Yay!!!   We're far apart but I'm sure one of us can make it over to the other sometime this weekend ahha. @ the people giving my friends shit for not accepting them into their zine...that's not how life works...I'll fight u????? If I fought every time I didn't get into a zine I'd be so tired y'all ?? Me too u nu it's a small fandom too. Hehe it's fun that way cause he's the least comfortable   and I liked breaking the norm w nejire in the middle!! Girl power! . I wanted to leave 5 hours ago and instead I'm in bed w this heating pad again I'm so frustrated. Rejection is a part of life and you can be bummed but dragging in people who aren't even involved in the situation is immature and causing ~drama~ u nu. ?! Are you gonna cosplay one of them??? :O. Aaaa I'll look forward to it!! . Quick shoutout to Office Depot for my last minute prints without the bs few Staples now charges for same-day  pic.twitter.com/iclXqTN2Kh. Yeah that's right I just tweeted shade at staples fight me. FEE all my salty tweets are riddled with typos which lessen ther impact. I MADE A MISTAKE IN THE TWEET ABT MAKING MISTAKES Done I'm deleting my account. Just saw a beautiful shooting star!! It was pinkish!! I have a theory that they add 10 extra square feet to our room every time we stay here. yeah.. :( @jlist  if you're not gonna ask for permission, please at least credit so the hard-working artist gets the recognition they deserve!! ANY AA FRIENDS AT ANIME NYC #animenyc  do I have to go to reg on third floor first? Dragging stuff from taxi so trying to figure out order of operations so I'm not dying . Traffic is worse than Boston and I should have known that orz. Yep I figured it out!! Thank u tho!! Wait I thought you weren't here? OHHH THATS AWESOME!! see you soon then!!! Blindcon 2018 pic.twitter.com/E0Wew0QCjd. Too bright to be kawaii. Seriously I felt like an asshole but I put on sunglasses at one point .

I KNOW I BROUGHT LAYERS BUT ONLY TO LAYER UP.. Yes please!!! . Uh if anyone wants to trade please hit me up bc I wanna buy everything from y'all but it was kinda slow today so I can't justify it .

I AM OVERWHELMED BY THE AMOUNT OF KIRISHIMAS IN THIS POST . IT WAS @catscantdraw  --- I'm sorry we did such a bad job at repaying you . LMFAOOO I was like "maybe they forgot to write it on the back of theirs" .  Thank you for the blessed kiribakus. Yeah..that was overkill.... which  sounds like a ship name for Shiragaki x Hero Killer . The most civil and polite exchange I've seen on twitter pic.twitter.com/bE0ER9WXca. People ship everything so probably..   Quick! Someone find said shippers and alert them to this sick ship name . @ ghostvom  really feeling your twitter handle rn..I'm still in bed. Found it! @MyHanKoKo  also this analysis got me shook pic.twitter.com/3wM1AWamoU.

OK THE LAST TWO SEMESTERS MY MOM JUst ON A WHIM CHECKED CLASS OPENINGS ONCE AND GOT ME IN TO CLASSES THAT WERE FULL BEFORE??? I LOVE HER???? WHAT THE HECK. She truly is.

My advisor is useless but I'm trying to contact her before it fills...  mission accomplished. Thank you for stopping by!! "I don't have a problem," I whisper softly to myself over and over again pic.twitter.com/DNAJJy1YbK. Look at those matching bakugrins LOL. Yeah I don't see one either.. I see 6 LMFAO. LMFAOO SORRY FOR EXPOSING EVERYONE TO THIS MASTER ANALYSIS. IF ONLY I KNEW.. A Korean artist here on twitter but I haven't been able to find them again . Aaa wish I got to throw merch at u BUT IT WAS NICE TO MEET U . I was scared of cosplaying for years bc I didn't understand that this wasn't A Thing You Had To Do. I think some days we all need a life size makkachin. Yikes. I'm so sorry this is happening to you. I think you should definitely talk to a lawyer abt it. And USPS is a government thing so I feel like there should be smth to do... Relatable. My bf cosplayed w me once but then texted a pic of us to his bro group and wrote smth like "the things I do to get laid" and I'm--- . I didn't get out of bed until 2 today and then felt bad so I crawled back in bed and 8 and slept til 1 and I fucked up yall. "On a scale of one to ten how tired do u feel after a convention" directs u to this tweet. Me: I'll never use a physical calendar

Holy shit fjdnnddn SERIOUSLY THO I expected art on the top, calendar on the bottom like A Functional Calendar . But I'm so hyped about being able to look at these illustrations up close and in the flesh so i have no regrets. It's not a very good calendar for..calendar purposes tho  pic.twitter.com/Yi5NiWk4zJ. Oh shit I totally forgot I wanted to make/organize a calendar!!! I got distracted by cafes . Relatable tweet. Thanks, deviated septum. I got a bug bite???? it's November?? I am so confused.

...HE WAS NICE ASIDE FROM THAT BUT DAMN. Hnn I got all made up since my bf is home but my moms taking us to the cemetery first so it'll prob all b for naught . Love is not waking up your sleep-deprived boyfriend when you know for a fact there is mac n cheese downstairs. (Assaulted in a dark alleyway) (smacks them in the face with twenty pounds of plastic). ?! HOW IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE? Take it easy D:. MMMM CHAPTER 161 SPOILER LOOKS BAD , MAN. Me too!

Small spoiler: here's ya boys... pic.twitter.com/0XTE8XbiMg. INSTEAD, LETS TALK ABOUT THINGS THAT *DIDNT* HAPPEN THIS CHAPTER..For example, I'm still waiting on my kiribaku reunion, sensei (softly) ..please don't fuck it up. When will my boy return from war..and by war I mean fuming alone in the dorms /AWAY/ from the fight. DON'T DO IT. YEs. 1 outfit, 2 days, 0 regrets. SORRY ITS BEEN HOURS BUT KOREAN RAWS HERE  http:// wasabisyrup.com/archives/7-6Er QE7Uk8   …. I really need to know if his hair is still spiked or he went to the effort to do that somehow.. if only the acrylic keychains weren't blinds u nu I'm not brave enough.

Safe travels and happy shopping y'all  pic.twitter.com/zugJuca6Tc. I can't believe I had to remake my sales post bc I didn't put my shop link in it why do I even do anything w a migraine. YEAH I'VE TAKEN TWO NAPS SINCE NYC TOO... it was just so hectic?? Rest !!! I was so excited to be stuck in the house today so I could do some stuff around the house but now headache and overheating??? IM FUCKING DYING OVER HERE my mom was showing me smth on her computer and accidentally opened a window searching for plush nitotan Kirishima and she was like "...whoops" and  was like I APPRECIATE U BUT YOU'LL NEVER FIND HIM - BUT WAIT IT GETS BETTER. Then she's telling me when she was searching "all sorts of stuff was coming up..Bakugou had his shirt off and they were positioned in a certain way" "a certain way?!" "Like his head was at his chest and I didn't know if he was doing something or just hanging out". "DAHSNBD JUST HANGING OUT?!" "Well I couldn't tell if he was gonna go up or down - ha, going down" "/MOM/". Anyways it's 4:34 AM and that's the story of how my mom tried to get me the stupid lil plush I've been pining after "I just want to make you happy" but was searching for the one that's not out for weeks by mistake and ended up looking at soft kiribaku porn. Lrt guys this might be the 4:30 AM talking, but I'm this close to making a two piece charm of Kirishima and his fucking clock. The internet and google algorithms are beautiful  . In keeping with this, two of the three names on the cover are men orz. AAA I WANTED TO GO TO THE LINE STORE BUT I WAS TOO BURNT OUT. Is it worth seeing next time?  you got this!!

I'm so confused by all the controversies - am I supposed to see Coco or not? . Mm this is secondhand but originally it was smth like too similar to book of life and appropriating Mexican culture/no or few Mexican people working on it? And then more recently someone working on it accused of sexual assault?? But then people were saying so many others worked hard and to still see it and that if it flopped $ wise they wouldn't get representation again / Disney wouldn't make more diverse movies...MAYBE.. I can't remember exactly. Mmmm top left? I like top middle but I don't think it'll read well . (See op). Maybe I could just open the small one..even Chanukah isn't for a couple weeks. In the future I'm gonna need my secret santas to send the packages on December 20th bc it's so tempting djdjdn what is self control.

MM I think the bathrooms are on the bottom so I'm looking in that L between the entrance and the bathroom. It's broken tho.. Are you in AANI? The head has contacted someone abt fixing it. Everyone's having the same problem. LMFAOO yeah I'm about ready to give up - I had a headache before this nonsense even started hahaha. yeah I just restarted from the beginning and it wouldn't work still (Sigh) I'm not gonna hold my breath but if either of us gets in at any point let's message the other just in case we can be neighbors!

I signed up for an art/craft fair at my school and it's outside. In December. Help them. YES THAT IS ACCURATE... "Wear layers" - This e-mail . Unfriended. I'm still waffling abt whether to screen print or regular print mine ; A;. I literally laughed aloud when I saw the design. I used to eat those all the time when I was little~  I LOVE IT! I haven't had them in years! It's making me want to buy some but often when I try a food I loved from my childhood it doesn't seem to hold up :(. THATS WEIRD YOURE WEIRD BYE. Was anxiously checking for messages from people in Japan and China but it's early in the night and I'm stupid. \o/ progress ! Lrt do you think we'll get to blobs in season 3. IT IS A REALLY GOOD BOOK. I love this out of context. This, The Great Gatsby, and A Separate Peace are my faves from high school!! . suddenly there's a lot of ichigo and luchia cosplays available and I want to live out my childhood dreams but $.... hypothetically tho;;.

Cinnamon rolls confirmed   LOL. ok I have to have four designs printed on fabric by Monday and so far I have made one and have ideas for one more. send help... getting insurance for the café (required by venue) and gee whiz there sure are a lot of words here. I FUCKING HATE THAT I HATE THAT SO MUCH. LRT SERIOUSLY DON'T DO THIS?! Sometimes people have big changes in style and maybe you don't prefer the new one but there are so many different aspects they could have improved in (anatomy, color, composition, etc.) so to discount that hard work is...shitty.......... :') I wanna but it's scary. So I was just buying cheap clearance stuff at marshalls to print on cause savers closed early but turns out this thing I thought was a shapeless dress is actually a romper and actually kinda cute?!! pic.twitter.com/Y6eRyf679r. I got a pocket tee too and I low-key wanna do the hidden flipping off thing w Bakugou...... Much sport pic.twitter.com/Z9QKQqSDGj. My gal pic.twitter.com/KnJDzBwIxL. Bnha doodles..nejire, kiri, and baku for your soul pic.twitter.com/2tDfvutQ1q. I can't remember if I signed up for a third secret santa or only thought abt it and i'm GETTING STRESSED OUT. MMM sometimes youtube will start playing me Disney songs and fuck I reaLLY WANNA WATCH MULAN NOW BUT I GOT SHIT TO DO. i did catch up on packages that are shippable (no preorder items) and my secret santa packages are out tho!! . WELCOME TO MY NIGHTMARE. (softly) this is a really good ref of these nightmare outfits. Every time I look at this drawing  I get embarrassed but in a completely different way than usual  . ALRIGHT submitted my design for a more accurate quote... I'm SO ANXIOUS.. I REALLY hope it works out ...please send good vibes my way!! I AM VERY EMOTIONALLY INVESTED. IT WAS LIKE DOUBLE WHAT I EXPECTED SO IM GONNA REVISE HAHAHAH IM DYING help.  I'm not so sure but I really hope so!! Thank you so much !! I just hope she'll work with me on the price. I understand they can't change it that much but like helping me make it less complex and not like "u can't afford it bye" haha. Like I could do it but it would be SUPER IRRESPONSIBLE and I would never cause I'm not A Risk Taker . McDonald's is out of cookies this days really turning around the wrong way dude. You too . Ugh gotta. Figure this out...... Ice cream weather.. pic.twitter.com/zh7kJ69pBu. (INHALES) ok after discussing w friends I made some small revisions and hopefully it'll get the price down enough that i can feel comfortable..it wasn't a bad price for my very complicated request it's just ...a bit higher of an investment than I was comfy with. THAT'S AMAZING GREY?! . Wheeze ok BIG pet peeve here. I understand the appeal of sending $ via 'friends & family' option but 1. it's against ToS and my paypal account is IMPORTANT 2. If I don't know you and I'm buying smth from you, it's not covered by purchase protection and that doesn't make me comfy. "NO THANKS" mirio is good reaction image. Shdndj dekus action was super predictable hahaha. Like u changed the future pls just keep on keepin on babe. Ok yeah I made revisions and it didn't matter so..I'll try preorders and if it flops and I don't sell enough to cover like half  I'll refund y'all. ITS REALLY CUTE AND I DIED FOR IT PLEASE GIVE ME THE $ . It's also against tos to make the buyer pay the sellers fees but I offer to do that anyway. Lrt me right now.

I don't wanna beat a dead horse tho so if I only get like 2 orders I'm not gonna keep it open to make myself and my followers suffer haha. Ahh I see.. Thank you for the heads up.

Sobbing why can no convention just do sign ups right?? It's not?? That hard??? I still can't get through to the tekko website... it's way too fucking late probably.. it didn't go through the first time I hit submit even...but UgUGHGDFHFG Thank you, you're a blessing..their site literally still won't load for me..it loaded ONCE in 30 minutes and it was the old page with no link or anything esghtrdfdgh. anyways that was fucked. Normally I'm on AANI too but I was out and trying not to use my hot spot more djdndjdnjddn it's so fucked up tho that these cons keep pulling this shit where their sites can't handle traffic then they post a link somewhere not everyone has access to or knows about in advance. Rad pic.twitter.com/m34hbtjTgX. LOOK WHO WAS WAITING FOR ME WHEN I GOT HOMEEEEE pic.twitter.com/12704y5QMn. Anyways found this thrifting today   my birth year too.. pic.twitter.com/Pz52pjWUUE. pic.twitter.com/IZn78KaJU0. LMFAOO I JUST ASSUMED IT WAS EXPENSIVE SO I DIDNT BUY IT but I kinda wish I did . Yeah!! Such a coincidence. Yes . Jdndjsbs it's in providence . I also made this friend today u vu pic.twitter.com/48qnxJK4Qc. It's finals and my classmate returned to the studio and proclaimed, "Snacks for everyone! Animal crackers, cheddar cheese crackers.....and wine!". What is time management 10 hour screen printing til I got kicked out of the building . I got through all the fuck ups in the studio only to have my brother make me cry after I got home  so close.. Ahh, I've only ever had long hair but it keeps getting pressed to my neck by my scarf and getting itchy and knotted   I imagine short hair is much easier to handle. I gotta...get into school...my body is Wrecked. Tfw when your final critique is the only one that goes badly /lays down. I feel fucking sick but I didn't want a bad grade so I stayed and cleaned for an hour and missed the express train and now this one is late. Alternate universe where the 5:10 train shows up or the MBTA actually tells us it'll be late and how long. Thank you so much!!  That means a lot . I love my mom pic.twitter.com/7QPDhB6ILs. Anyways today was Bad, I low-key cried in the hall, almost puked on train but considering a classmate literally just left for an hour+ bc she was stressed, another classmate broke down 2x +had prof get their stuff for em so they could leave,I'm gonna give myself a pat on the back. Friendly reminder that mental health is important and art school is hell even when it's not a prestigious one . And fuck. Whatever. I made some prints. They're not great but I spent ten hours making them so I can't shit on them that much or I'll just feel even worse. The point was to do it and I did it and they're Not Great and whatever. Fuck. I'm just frustrated bc every other print..didn't go /well/ but the end product was more successful.. Red Baron out here tryna claim three mini pizzas are the equivalent of one small pizza when clearly it's four. also I'm still hungry and it's 3 AM send help. Update my mom got me a donut today bless.

Look I get it they're putting in a fuckton of work, want it to be the most beautiful it can be, but I just feel like they're professionals+need to learn to not give fans dates when they cannot meet them?? Episode 9 delay, US delay, a couple s2 delays before this.. All I'm saying is if you need more time that's fine just understand that when you give a date and miss it you're letting down lots of fans and it would be better to just tell them when you're ready bruh.

Preorders end tomorrow night! Guarentee yours@ http:// yearoftheunderdog.bigcartel.com   pic.twitter.com/tBlxpMyjw7. Fuuuuck me I've been sleeping particularly badly the past few weeks - having trouble /falling asleep/, constantly having crazy dreams and waking up multiple times and this morning I had one hour of the most peaceful sleep but it's the one day I had to be up at 9 and I'm dead. Hnn I do eat badly but typically I go on walks every day - just not recently bc it's been literally 0-9 degrees for days . I'm glad you're able to sleep better now tho!!  mine goes in waves. My hairs still red on top but I'm digging whatever's happening on the bottom..not sure what color it is tho  pic.twitter.com/RpaAk0uCx1. This is adorable ?!?! Yes!!! A lot of them are already in and looking SO GOOD. Started from the bottom now we here pic.twitter.com/WXKTNzhxsI. If I drove I would hang them proudly from the rear view mirror like dice. One (1) really cute pigtail pic.twitter.com/bJvCX1UU3o. THANK YOU I EXPERIENCED MUCH STRIFE. There's still a short period of time to guarantee yourself a copy while I hunt down the last couple people and assemble the file~ https:// twitter.com/cambrasine/sta tus/944735117943103489   …. * Q* I adore these nay!! i think i'm finally getting my mom and brother's cold... "Oh my god this person is allergic to chocolate?!"
"To chocolate?! I would /die/."
"..Only if you ate chocolate.". my moms pulling out all these old toys so we can get rid of some and it's fucking me up tbh. It's probably the time of year tbh.. I'm getting sick so slowly it's hard to know it's really happening. I LOVE ANNA   Please support them

 http://www. etsy.com/shop/TheSardine   pic.twitter.com/hYG3lKvNuD. HE'S A HANDSOME BOY. Guess the door between my room and the bathroom doesn't close anymore..cool.. HoLYSHITNDNDNDNCNC. Got a bunch of pics of refined sample plush and IM LAUGHING CAUSE THE NAKED FRONT PHOTO-- the angle makes it feel like "double chin" plush equivalent. I really need to get on this .. Should I be watching this too?! I just saw it on Netflix last night :o. Will do!! I couldn't fall asleep for like hours last night bc post nasal drip running down my throats making me nauseous and choking me and I don't wanna be full fledged sick but I don't love this version either. JUST HAD A SMALL HEART ATTACK BC I went downstairs and Cady wasn't on the couch. Or waiting by the door. Or under the table. Or in the kitchen. Turns out she went upstairs for the first time in months and slept in my moms room for the first time ever. A normal persons thought process: maybe she's sleeping in a bedroom
Me, Anxious + half awake: oh no, poor thing I hope she hasn't been stuck in the kitchen too long...she's not here..did the doors blow open? Sid someone..steal our dog?..did she go downstairs? OH GOD THE RABBIT---. Relatable tweet. I don't even know what it's like to not wear two pairs of pants anymore. I wore two pairs of /socks/ the other day. It's my last day w my bf so of course I feel like a truck drove over me. Guhhhh I don't want this cold at all. Ok y'all if I watch the new devilman crybaby without knowing anything will I be ok or no. Thank you!! I'll put it on my mental list of shows to watch . I'm... CADY WAS SO SCARED BY THE WINDS LAST NIGHT THAT SHE OPTED TO POOP IN THE KITCHEN??....she hasnt had an accident since she was like 6 months old....she's 3..u ok.. . Hmm depends on how much :o tho I'm better w animated violence than live action. gets up at 2:30
Back in bed by 4:30
I was gonna do some work but now I wanna sleep again jfnfjf. they ok? . I saw someone drew Kiri with roots and PINK HAIR and it was fucking brilliant
Like I've seen the whole roots/bleach thing before but I hadn't seen someone like 'but when the red /rinses out/ tho' and I feel this hard bc my hairs been doing this too. Mm like I love Kingsman but that's about my gore limit orz. SKY HIGH WAS ON TV and I was like 'wow this concept would make a good anime' and a few weeks latter I was introduced to BNHA and was like HOLY SHIT. yo I just googled it and THEY'RE MAKING A SEQUEL??? :O. YEAH I'm so curious what direction they'll take it.. alright I watched two eps of devilman crybaby \o/. SAM FLAM... to this day I'm not sure how to feel abt it. I need food/water but I could use a tiny bit more sleep and I know once I sit up shits gonna start coming out of my face and I'll never rest again. Lrt is a good thread. I remember I almost couldn't spent New Years with my boyfriend one year bc everyone decided to go up to a ski lodge and we literally didn't even have that much money . (Softly) just do whatever 
Like sie said the fantasy designs are really inconsistent and armor isn't the most practical for the cafe setting so whatever you do make sure it's comfy :o. LRT WHAT EVEN IS THIS SHOW. ahh..my grandma's last living friend left us a weird voicemail and it sounded Bad and we called her back but she's going to bed..at 4:30.....anxiety ensues. mom: make sure you're drinking water~
me: FUCK OFF, MOM
(I'm trying to flush out this cold but I have to pee like every two seconds). TW: animal death

Is there a way to..euthanize a fish do you think? We tried water changes, medication, plants, etc. but he's not any better and he's just on his side and not eating and..suffering probably...I think it's just old age.. what should I watch while I eat dinner. THIS DIDNT GO HOW I EXPECTED BUT ILL WATCH IT https:// twitter.com/cambrasine/sta tus/950176500044718081   …. Sanrio Boys Ep 1 Thread. I am 1:30 in. I can't read the dialogue and see who belongs to what kingdom at the same time. Blood has been drawn. I'm assuming this is some like fantasy theater thing.....? What am I watching. I'm having Free! flashbacks. distant kirishima cousin pic.twitter.com/Xv2wqBdDlT. petition to let him have pompompurin merch. EXCUSE YOU THATS NO WAY TO TREAT POMPOMPURIN. my mom: I must now kill the boys who teased me and kept me from my grandma--
me: THATS DEFINITELY NOT THE PLOT. alright y'all that was silly af it's like you can't even get into it bc you're just reminded you need to be buying sanrio merchandise???????? PFFF IDK I'm probably gonna keep watching it cause its light and funny in a way it probably didn't intend to be. dad: Why don't you accomplish something? It's invigorating!
(Makes a play based on Sanrio characters)
dad: so what exactly am I looking at here. if you're looking for a chill jam I gotcha https://www. youtube.com/watch?v=nw_k7O VP4mk   …. I..never posted my own previews..

(I ordered a very small amount of extras!) pic.twitter.com/QwVM088efb. - Head Cold: Day 2 of ? -
(Puts Vaseline all over my face)
I am Healthy and Beautiful and Everything is going to be Fine. 6:17 AM fun fact about me: I have A LOT of trouble falling asleep when I'm sick . I feel like I'm in the fucking dessert I'm literally putting bowls of water around my room, and just drank three full glasses..every breath burns my nose and throat..what is happening. Omg you're really starting to get a little collection!! . Me: I'll rest so I can get better quickly
My body: nah pic.twitter.com/3mPtK3c9g3. /kicks sm*rtpress gimme my heckin proof. TJSGJTDHHOHmygod. something about this mesh tank just feels 100% right. my mom just told someone on the phone that I was laughing at her but I'm literally just sitting here, staring straight ahead and breathing thru my mouth............ Cannot function. Finally surrendered and took Benadryl. Well, generic Benadryl. (Screams) pic.twitter.com/NBbz0ld2zL. My "sleep" last night . Sleep Cycle! It's called Sleep Cycle ! Ok I still feel pretty bad but I would like to declare that I THINK the worst of it is over..I even got a fever last night ; n;. I was able to breathe through BOTH nostrils for like a good 15 minutes and it was euphoric. I had my scarf over my face and tried to drink through a straw. It went exactly how you'd imagine. Thank u nu. I can't believe I thought I had seen every episode of 6teen, only to find out that some episodes didn't air in the US. photoshop keeps lagging i'm gonna fREaK. me: I'M GONNA GET!! DRAGON STICKERS!! FOR THE WALL!
mom: I thought you wanted the dots? We've moved onto dragons?
me: ---- FOR THE CAFE. anyway I just saw a tweet with the word crybaby in it that wasn't about devilman and. ok i haven't been able to get anything done so i'm gonna update all my shit and photoshop better work after.. it's a small canvas idk why it's being so fussy. What have I walked into. That sounds like a good place to be tbh. I'm crying I'm trying to update my computer but it?? Won't?? It's like ok I gotta restart and I'm like yea do it but nothing happens so I tried letting the restart timer run out and ITSTILLSIDNTDKDNDNDNDBFNDNDSNFNX. I was trying to photograph how long it said this update will take but my screen is so filthy that I got embarrassed . Ohmygod I'm sorry but I need to see this... also that's how I feel every time I try to make a charm set . I BELIEVE IN U!! i'm gonna lose it photoshop is still lagging to the point where i'm unable to dra.w...w.h..y. Oh cool now it's just quitting itself. This is. Ideal. Or enjoy countless hours of the rainbow wheel from hell while layers turn on and off at random pic.twitter.com/zT8lj0tBAg. i'm dEAD I UPDATED PHOTOSHOP AND NOW IT JUST HAS A QUESTION MARK OVER THE ICON AND WONT OPEN WHAY ISH PAHREJTHFHGFH. alright this drawing is cursed there is no other explanation. beautiful!! * U*. omg no!! mine has a little blip at the bottom D:. ok i tried my moms comp too and it ain't working so it's clearly some fucking problem and I am moving it to a new file again but ONE LAYER AT A TIME glitchy af. well. several hours later, it is fixed. doesn't feel like much of a victory........ I'm usually completely accurate in guessing what time it is when I wake up but I actually slept last night for the first time in three nights so I was like ehh it's prob 11 and anyways it's 1:30 and my ass is still in bed but I'm sick so that's ok.. GOOD NEWS MY LIL PLUSH BOY IS GONNA BE HERE ON THE TWELVETH?! Lrt PLEASE DONT DO THIS?! People are spending hours of their time making smth for your project the least you can do is give them a copy!! International shipping adds up but for domestic it shouldn't cost more than like $6-11 per person. I haven't ever less than broken even on a project but you have to understand that is a possibility so you shouldn't make something you don't think will sell. And doing this project is already a work of passion probably? I've been lucky enough to host + be in zines where artists made  $ xxx  but that's not always the case. you have to understand that they r spending time on THIS instead of smth that definitely makes $ or for themselves. Sending out BTMHZ payments felt like giving hefty Christmas bonuses . Anyways the least u can do is media mail them a damn book. Also if it's for charity I have seen people ask artists if they want to voluntarily contribute to their book cost/postage and I think that's 100% cool. Err..context for this being when you have to repay others for their work and aren't able to bear it financially. Otherwise make whatever the heck you desire \o/. if someone spends 3-10 hours on a drawing I'm throwing a $4 book at them whether they like it or not . Aaaaa I HAVE THINGS TO DO BUT THIS SOUNDS FUN. Do you know the origin? I'm at the like coughing up blood stage and I don't love it. LMFAO it's progressing faster than usual for me tho so hopefully I'll be like 80-98% better by the cafe. dsgjdfgj sometimes that's true but this is the first time I've been sick since when I got sick for the cafe! I typically get sick once right after school starts (sept), once in the winter(dec-feb), and once when it changes from spring to summer (apr-june)..! Thank you!! . I started feeling kind of awful again (mouthbreathes). you know what I want for christmas? pochacco boy >:(@sanrio danshi pleaase. please give me sport boy w crop top. this is true..but I want youthful boyish pochacco boy!! (me trying to design pochacco boy)

Like Friday was WOW SOON HAPPY EXCITE and now it's "Awww...". I HATE THIS. i'm -- i keep almost placing this order then remembering more shit i need. Aaaa I just got my notif!! WHY DOES IT SAY SOME DIFFERENT WEIRD COMPANY EVERY TIME... Big projects have desensitized me so much. Like I don't feel crazy spending $500 on charms for myself when I've paid $1000+ for project charms.. Thing is...everyone wants crybaby but everyone's MAKING crybaby.. Mine says TIDEBUY this time . Djjdjdndbd relatable tweet..phone calls give me Much Anxiety. FedEx?? Sucks?!! Maybe you can pick it up at your local facility? NO TBH I THINK U HAVE A VERY SOLID AMOUNT there's only like 140 people total, including staff! ALSO WHAT IS THIS LINE "How the hell have you been keeping then?" WHO TALKS THAT WAY-----. if anyone could just..let me know if you got your holiday card from me...that would be A+.............

This is the truest statement I have ever seen in my life
Bless this post. Lrt I need to catch up on vigilantes.... Dnshdhdhe I wanted to go to the beach today but cadys been itching like crazy (not new) and has bumps (definitely new) so we're going to the vet instead. Charm order..did they finally run out of tape at that place?! pic.twitter.com/BteCz1CG67. I got acrylic stands for the café and a few designs for a friend! I wish I could say this is the biggest box I've received but. THANK YOU!!! me too I'm dyin they keep telling me they'll deliver it then it gets delayed (shakes fist at UPS). I'll have some of these at the @plusultraboston  café! God the acrylics smell so strong this time why. tiddie. BDJDJD I TIPPED TRAVIS BC HE COMPLIMENT MY HAT AND I GOT NERVOUS. (For reference I picked up food). I am 12 seconds into t&b and I have a question already @unagicake. "I'm gonna watch smth new.. OH I could watch houseki no kuni and be relevant!....or..OH WAIT TIGER AND BUNNY TIGER AND BUNNY TIGER ANS DHUDNDNDJS". AHSNDJSJD WE'RE HALFWAY THRU EPISODE ONE OF TIGER & BUNNY AND MY MOM GOES, "What's the name of this show? Pig and who?" and I laughed so hard I cried. THE FUCK IS A STERN DOLLAR. Also that's wild!! I was gonna watch smth else when I remembered it!! BABY KOTETSU IS SOOO CUTE. THATS STUPID. IM ONLY ON EP THREE BUT SO FAR I LIKE THIS SHOW A LOT?! I LOVE KOTETSU ....AND ...ORIGAMI CYCLONE. AA I didn't meet Ivan yet!! Like civilian form !! Do you remember when he shows up? I watched episodes 1-5. UPS finally updated my delivery date to tomorrow just now even tho they acknowledged Saturday delivery was requested at 18 hours ago. Then they scanned it again at the place it's been sitting for longer than that. Please...my boy...get him home. Sjnddjs I'm worried abt spoilers ..I wanna keep watching but I shouldn't... . Lrt this would make me so happy. I'm waiting to finish devilman so meanwhile enjoy lots of big coat fan art. This needs, like, a thousand more likes and retweets. pic.twitter.com/y0p8152Pb0. ...Suns out, tiddies out (don't@me  )

You can get a boy for yourself at  http:// Cambrasine.storenvy.com     

Those of you attending @plusultraboston  next weekend can fawn over this sample~

More pics in replies! pic.twitter.com/TsJufeLkRi. Cady did not appreciate being used as a prop. pic.twitter.com/dgbBfUrxy7. POSTING THESE FEELS WEIRD BUT HERES WHAT HE LOOKS LIKE UNDERNEATH pic.twitter.com/ITh8vnc3ak. I can't believe I leaked Kirishima Eijirou's nudes. Yes!! A long journey but he made it. IDK WHY BUT ITS SO FUNNY ISNT IT?! LMFAOOO WHAT DID U WANT ME TO DO HE HAS TO HAVE A BUTT. ITS THE SEAM BUT ITS PLACED PERFECTLY HUH. THANK YOU SHEA. BUT BUT..KIRIBAKU. AA THANK Y. Aaa I was so blinded by his cute face!! Thank you so much Liz !! can someone link me the new miraculous episode? last time I looked for one I got spoiled trying to find it ; A;. dsgdhth gonna finish overdue packages tomorrow.. so so sorry for the wait! I'll throw in extra goodies!! That sa*koucon email---
Just bc u can fit a ton more artists DOES NOT mean you should!? Competition will be shit for ev1
And opening for a 2nd wave of applications is like saying fuck you to waitlisted artists - essentially 'we're gonna see if anyone better applies again' . not worth the traveling for me anyway but I feel bad for ppl who already paid. They're gonna have way more competition all of a sudden+it'll affect their sales/profit. And for waitlisted artists that are local or genuinely wanna go potentially being kicked down to the bottom.. And people who weren't diligent to apply the first time getting the spots instead..like we've all forgotten application dates before but it seems really unfair to currently waitlisted artists. THESE ARE TOO CUTE!! IT GAVE ME..AN IDEA..WHICH YOU ARE FREE TO USE OR COMPLETELY IGNORE but I present ...some good faces for your consideration pic.twitter.com/p3LEKirJP4. yes!! I think variety is fun~ I hope so!! I'd love to see them! * U*. Lemon juice potions pic.twitter.com/DTN43yeOli. THANK YOU!! I got them for a different purpose which they didn't fit, but this works too haha. There should be a theme restaurant that changes themes like every 3 months............. putting together orders and good lord why do the acrylics smell so strongly this time? I definitely tweeted about this before but it's...STRONG. ITS LIKE A POP UP THING except it's always existing but just changes themes often enough to keep it exciting
aaaaAA THAT WOULD B E AWESOME
quick - someone give me half a million dollars. SGDHFHFJ I don't got that kind of time/money/business knowledge for that anytime soon, but it's a nice idea, right? ; u; Maybe someday...................
I REALLY LIKE THE IDEA THO AND HYPOTHETICALLY OF COURSE U CAN JOIN . ahhaah My bro talks about a sustainable restaurant and he's a geo/bio/forestry major, so maybe we'll combine our powers some day!! haha. FHESIGTRD THANK U BUT waIT TIL AFTER THIS ONE TO SAY THAT--
Idk why but i'm like 7x as nervous as last time?!! Even though I'm probably more organized??! Everyone had such a good time last time and I'm glad but PRESSURE IS ON............ THANK YOU!! YES IT IS..A LOT OF WORK /sobbing. You're new but being an artist is chiller~ All you have to do is set up then sell from your table during free times (like 30 min of each block, plus all of block 4)~ You can draw guest requests while they eat if u want but don't have to. During the rest of the time you can get involved w cosplayers if you feel confident or just chill out in the staff room, or comfy couch area, or the terrace or wherever~. LMFAOOOO
(PRESENT MIC SCREAMING IN THE DISTANCE)
"Uh...Is he ok?"
"Yeah, he's fine, he just needed a break.". ps can I join u  
"Jenn! These people don't remember what food they ordered and they're saying it's not what you wrote on the list you spent hours making" 
"..."
"Jenn?"
(JENNIE, TOO BUSY SCREAMING IN THE DISTANCE). lrt someone buy me ALL OF THESE PLEASE. My dog is being
Such a pain lately??? 
Why is she so much more bored than usual?! Because my bro and his gf left or..?? SHE IS COMPLAINING A LOT EVEN THO IVE BEEN WALKING HER MORE. I had nightmares but was able to fall back asleep but then I just had them again?! No thanks?! Omg... watching the people in BNHA Reddit freak out about the hints given about the next chapter only to then be told no chapter this week   same. Usually the UPS guy goes to the wrong door so we put a sign there but it's not at either door. Hahahahaha I'm freaking out. Me too or we'll be pretty screwed . Time to go knock on neighbors doors?!!!! Kill me??? Can I just say like what world do we live in where delivery people do not knock on your door or ring the bell?! I've had so many packages delivered these last couple weeks and they're all just SILENT AND RUN. THEY LEFT IT AT THE MAILBOX THATS NOT HOW UPS WORKS?! IVE GOTTEN TWO OR THREE ORDERS FROM THE SAME COMPANY HERE AND ALL HAVE BEEN LEFT AT THE DOOR Y'ALL SENT ME INTO A PANIC!! How is the mailbox on a fairly busy street a safe place to leave a BIG box of PAPER ?! I'm dead. Right?! At my last address they always knocked what the hell is this guys problem? . UPS Driver: Hmm I could easily drive a quarter mile down the street and deliver the package at the door as is my job and as I have done in the past or
I could leave it at the mailbox, send the recipient into a panic and make her haul a 10 lb box of paper down the road. In the snow, without a bag . I can't post pics yet since the art is secret until the event but everything is beautiful and VIBRANT!! ily @catprint. Yes, luckily catprint shrink wraps everything. Blessed. Here's the backs of things + placemats at least  pic.twitter.com/Ktcj903gAP. Alright! Made up all the sets for staff, and randomized pieces for each block . ah...I ...worked really hard to finish this zine piece...even though I felt really stuck on it..painted over it a thousand times..and it is different than my usual and they tell me that it wasn't the style or 'the level' they expected from me............feels..really bad........ I understand their perspective but it still feels bad to be told the thing you worked hard on isn't good enough. omg..maybe they're trying to hide it from potential thieves? anyways todays been Just OK. I saw two gray-ish brown-ish canines in the woods and I couldn't tell if they were doggos or coyotes and considering I've only encountered four (4) people ever in the woods in four months I wasn't willing to take that chance so Cady didn't get off-leash run around time :(. guuhh I think i'm gonna...go,,, cry..... they pretty much said change it or draw something new within a week or you're out...I don't know that I have time to do that..I have one more zine piece to finish and that takes priority.. I guess they feel like I did tho orz I was trying to keep it loose and be careful not to overwork it but to them it's unfinished so fgdjhgfh. They worded it very nicely at least orz. I think Cadence has taken up throat singing. Honestly I do this by mistake sometimes but I always leave it and yknow what? It!! MAKES SENSE! Every social media has some nightmare algorithm now where they'll give you post more prominence the more well-received it is so -- go for it! aefgsdh Thanks for your support everyone!! 
Sorry, I had to vent a little and also.. people telling me being upset about this isn't totally unjustified was nice. R..right? I've run projects where someone submits something that isn't what I expected but like damn they made a thing for little or no profit and that's all I can really ask for >?!!? hahahaha yeah, no........I really want a few copies too so this Extra Sucks. LRT I still can't even imagine what this must have been like but I'm so glad this graph exists. yeah they pretty much told me they're not gonna put it in. SORRY TO BUTT IN -- But here is our plan for blocks 1-3! So it's probably only possible for Block 4 unless you move at HYPER SPEED or the schedule gets Destroyed pic.twitter.com/dZENswn02P. Or if it's one of the people who is returning from one of the earlier blocks for block 4. (Packing for the cafe)
Mom: what, are you gonna carry that? It's heavy!
Me: yeah but it's not heavy for a strong person!! DO IT I JUST WATCHED IT FOR THE FIRST TIME!! Finished Season 1 last night. I DID LOVE IT I REALLY DID?! Usually it takes me 3-5 eps to get into something but I loved t&b right off the bat!! Camie Voice: Sick. She's not really my type but for others she'd prob b really fun to cosplay at cons! I laid in bed thru the time I alotted for getting dressed guess I'm going in pajamas. Tired but on the way pic.twitter.com/EJNfH71WkS. It's time to play anxious stomach ache or my uterus pulling a total dick move? AAA THANK U I DID!! I got it at a store in Colombia   probably not easy to find... I LOVE IT THO. I don't see one   I'll ask my bro if he remembers the store, I think he said it was a chain. he said, and I quote, "Yes, but i have to think.." LOL So..I'll..get back to you?/. how is it already midnight. Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. I've felt so sick all day I spent most of it sleeping and some of it sitting in front of the toilet thinking I'd feel better if I just threw up but unable to make it happen   I'm glad my body felt 100% fine yesterday at least. I WILL POST MY HAUL SOON!! Me last time^^^. Thanks Mai! Feeling well enough for Ladybug tonight ;). Thanks!! I exhausted myself (kind of like post con) but I'll be fine. "Is the sauce in the bag?"
"Yes"
Narrator: It wasn't. Pats are headed to the Super Bowl
most ppl in mass: FUCK YEAHHHHH
me: NOW I'LL HAVE TO HEAR ABOUT THIS FOR TWO WEEKS. omg I love the label. Half of my haul from #plusultraboston  ! Thank you @circusbonez  and @_gommmu !! I LOVE MY BOYS pic.twitter.com/VgZ0q0y3zX. I think I'm funny pic.twitter.com/NcGhIJ42jB. The Sanrio boys boys are so pure but sometimes I think it'd be funny if it flashed forward like 40 years and they live alone surrounded by merch, polishing precious figurines from the 90's , meeting once a week only to bicker abt who is cutest. Mom: Waffles are kind of like cardboard - You can't have two pieces, you have to have three-------
Me: ....... I think you combined two different things you were trying to say. A lot of good teeth in this picture. An homage to Bakugou's skull shirt wardrobe pic.twitter.com/anOjWdVfDr. HE IS A VERY GOOD BOY. I wanna know how many times the snapchat filters were used for the cafe but i didn't log in this time I guess??? ohh I didn't last time either but I have to wait for them to email me..i'm so curious tho /rolls around. The only pizza/sub shop we've tried since we moved that doesn't Suck never has enough drivers so it's like 50/50 whether they even take our order... . I packed a ton of stupid shit for class tomorrow bc anxiety ..also I just like to start the semester w my backpack full of things and hope the important ones don't get pulled out when I need them. I have two hair ties, saline spray, aleve, a cough drop, period shit, passport card, student ID, both debit cards, cash, glasses, headphones, water, nutrigrain bar, every kind of pen, three flash drives, sketchbook, phone and computer chargers..... WHAT KIND OF JOB IS THIS... boy b y e. Mental health days are important! Nicole stop trying to kill me
It's 
Working. Ugh time to school. Lrt SCREAM. THE ONLY ANIMES ARE ATTACK ON TITAN AND SEXY ATTACK ON TITAN. Tfw everything is so covered in ice that you can't even grab onto the railing bc guess what it's FUCKING ICE. Thank you!! I was surprised bc I thought it was supposed to be 53 and sunny . He needs some Education :P. Yeah, I feel that. The place I typically go for lunch at school has signs that tell you how to pronounce gyro pic.twitter.com/LRvPpvuiWu. Glad I could be of service . pic.twitter.com/xPs3JZ4zYA. whsdhdbJDDJD oh my goodness . I should've brought my old screen in today so I could've worked on smth for myself/fun today since I have extra time but I'm stupid/was stressing this morning . This place has one of these signs on either side of the door. They're really tryna nail it in. I should bring a face mask for the train..everyone's coughing and it's stressing me out . Ohh!! Interesting!! Yes the people who run this place are Greek so makes sense . I felt like such a senpai today since I and II classes are mixed. just finishing up plus ultra math!! I usually eat half a sandwich at school and save the rest but since I didn't eat before class I ate the whole thing and now I wish I hadn't bc I'm hungry again and I want to eat the other half of my sandwich..that I already ate.......help. Donation = Made! We only raised a little more than last time, but based on staff and guest surveys the bigger venue was worth the cost. I'm hungry
That's it, that's the whole tweet. School gives me a special kind of stress - the one where I bite and pick the fuck out of my lower lip til it bleeds over and over again . I THINK ABOUT THAT FIRST PANEL A LOT. anyways I somehow ended up rewatching the 'you, too, can be a hero' scene and i teared up ...... feels. please...just start a month late and Live. Rena Rouge has such a cool outfit (softly) I ..want... It's time to play how many unattainable body suit cosplays can Jennie want? I think we're at three. Y i k e s. I forgot how simultaneously incredibly interesting and painfully mind numbing art history courses are.. At least we'll get past Jesus this time so maybe I'll know wtf is happening..my last prof was generally good abt keeping us Non Christians in the loop but I still feel like some shit went over my head. ...I reread this and it sounds ridiculous - like art is Pre Jesus, Jesus, and post Jesus . LRT COVER BOY!!! What is happening lately people keep slamming their doors into our car while I'm sitting in it?? Please stop?? This lady just did it like three times in a row?! Too anxious . probably bc he bleached the shit out of it . I'm. FRUSTRATED. There's a giant field right near my house down our quiet dead end street. The town voted 4 to 0 to buy the land. Then they had several more meetings and changed their fucking minds and are now gonna build a bunch of shit there and it's gonna be loud and i'm MAD. They're like 'look we're preserving a portion of it" yeah the fucking back corner so no one can see or access it. The rest is all gonna be a street, houses, and giant ass water basins. DIVERSE HOUSING MY ASS THIS TOWN IS OLD AF y'all are L O S T. I'm. How are $500k houses "affordable housing" for seniors ??? THAT'S MORE THAN WE PAID FOR tHIS HOUSE??!  killing me. "If you remember, before, we were gonna build some huge disney world here--" It was. A soccer field. I am full of local government rage. Sky high is a silly mofo...but uh I feel like we just left the robot thing behind for some episodes   (I'm still watching, no spoilers!!). THIS IS HEADING NOWHERE GOOD. OHHH SHIIITTT THIS IS GETTING SO GOOD!! I FINISHED TIGER AND BUNNY AND IT WAS VERY VERY GOOD ITS ONE OF MY FAVORITES NOW ?!?! I didn't watch the movies yet - are they good/worth watching too? GOOD TO KNOW!! Reminds me I've been meaning to watch the anohana movie for like..years . hahahah well I watched a LOT of episodes tonight but I'll look into them soon . My only lament about t&b is there isn't really a character I'd vibe w cosplaying orz. LITERAL POWER COUPLE. I read that someone thought it couldn't possibly make them cry and then it did so IM SCARED. Oops! Forgot to post the rest of my #plusultraboston  haul!!  pic.twitter.com/0ejwS49jgN. lrt I was reading about this literally two days ago and it Fucked Me Up. Hi @FlameCon  I'm confused by the wording on your site. If me and my friend want to share but there's only 0 - 1 half tables left, can we buy a full table and split it? I understand that there is only one listing in the guide/program per table so we couldn't have both of us listed. Thank you~. ...tfw the reading response prompt is unrelated to the reading??? I did lots of pose studies/gesture drawings last night! More in replies pic.twitter.com/2vDUGAU8Qs. pic.twitter.com/VM9S6SsUqv. studies turned weeb pic.twitter.com/Qfb7MsErbI. I waited for envelopes to arrive to mail calendars and now I just found a bunch more envelopes............ h e l p. Me: Sooo what are we watching with dinner? 
Mom: Aren't we gonna listen to Reply All?
Me: OHH YESyesyesyesyes yes
Mom: ...Yes..Yes..No? This tweet is so niche please listen to Reply All. I actually did run out of envelopes now (I think the ones I ordered are coming tomorrow) but I packed most of the calendars and WOW IT SURE IS QUICK WHEN THERES NO BUNDLES!! I know it's not as fun to create/consume but ..so nice for packing. i have lots of stupid ideas. http:// oh.my   .god. My brother forgot to cancel his prime membership and was really upset about it but it has come in handy.

I like him quite a bit. pic.twitter.com/ZKa7tOW2uO. ..i am Concerned for y'all. Ah yeah probably just a baby who needs to learn a lesson. SNERGIENRDTHYGfh LIZ. LRT BC THEY DIDNT AIR THIS EP IN THE US. LRT literally every time I think I can't love hamletmachine any more IT HAPPENS. DID THIS box thing start from that official merch?? I feel so out of the happenings. I'm so??? They're made so much YoI merch they're like I DONT KNOW ANYMORE UHH PUT EM IN A BOX OR SOMETHING! ...and we still eat it up LOL. This is True. Can someone explain this whole ribbon thing to me?? (Artists having random designs and giving them away..) Is this just a new thing or an ALA thing or???   I am fascinated and confused! lrt couldn't help but notice Ragdoll only has one expression.............is the other..a spoiler? . update: I have begun my research and I'm still curious how ALA has such a big ribbon culture and how I had never heard of this before this weekend? But I ?? wanna make ribbons for this season? Idk of what tho yet and I wonder if people will be confused anywhere other than ALA https:// twitter.com/cambrasine/sta tus/957781270490120192   …. between the tents and ribbons ALA is such an anomaly to me. seriously I don't care if I have to live in a tent I'm REALLY EXCITED BY RIBBON CULTURE what the hell happened that it's JUST there? I think I read it's more popular at sci fi cons too but I'm not sure.. me: these fuckers are so cute but what am I supposed to do with them, s*nrio will murder my ass
mom: SELL THEM ON THE DARK WEB. NO SHE DOESNT . Hmm!! Valuable info!! Thanks!!  I've somehow never seen artist making them before but I really like the idea :O. Huh!! I've heard sci-fi!! Why are anime cons so slow on certain things ?! Like ribbons and enamel pins !! Seriously we're like a decade late on enamel pins. YOURE THE FIRST COSPLAYER IVE SEEN OF HER AND YOU LOOK AMAZING!!  I mean uhhhh ur cosplay is  lit af. @ Nendoroid hear our prayers . I leaned over to kiss my doggo and she farted . "Hey kid I heard you like anime" pic.twitter.com/7tbjQc7yfO. Hey guys should I watch ajin. LRT IMDJDMFJFD DYING I need some form of Bakugou content for this Now . I'm watching soul eater by the way!! I'm liking it so far. The OP IS SO FUCKIN GOOD THO I watch it every time . If y'all thought I was joking about making charms of the kids in the pussycats' hero outfits for season 3 you are sorely mistaken . When I draw Iida he just looks like an Iida / Sir Nighteye hybrid orz. I can't decide whether to put Todoroki in a serious pose or the most absurd one bc he is Both. Don't test me.... pic.twitter.com/O02aukBS7U. I'll customize their outfits and tails a little to match their personalities/quirks/usual hero costumes  :3 c. After all who is Bakugou if he can't "kill with his knees". owww i'm having all the fun side effects of my period like aches and cramps without actually having it.....@my body what is this bs, the day before screen printing too................... Ow. Just kidding. Fuck. Djdndjdnsnsnbshrrrrrrr. I am more and more convinced I have endometriosis and I think I need to go back on the pill. Uughhbhbnjjgbjj. I can't decide which earring for the boy and my mom thought this would help. Spoiler alert: it didn't pic.twitter.com/iJHnUhGoYg. Also yes I'm in bed#cramps. Good news: I decided on the artist to do my presentation on this time! Bad news: I didn't figure out anything relevant to this weeks' classes. Can't stop won't stop. I wanted to get so much drawing done today but I had to lay down for three fucking hours and now I haven't eaten today bc I was cramping so hard so I won't get to start til late hnnnnnn. Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that :( hmm I did a bit of reading once the pain died down and it just sounds like pretty much exactly it (sigh). Yeah..I've been through this before but they were like unless u want us to cut u open just go on w your life   but the pains gotten worse the last few times so time for a visit . Shdndj thank you   the really bad pain isn't very long lasting at least so I'm already able to function again :P. Maka's hair looks simple but then I try to draw it and she kind of looks like a dog or something. WHAT THE HECK EVERYONES BEING REALLY NICE TO ME TONIGHT??? like a few people went out of their way and said really nice things to me unexpectedly and I'm . Seriously y'all trying to give me heart palpitations tonight or what ?! (Softly) thank u... Lrt please give these boys a home. You REALLY don't wanna see my art room then.. H e l p pic.twitter.com/GFD3mHIbj2.  thank you...I feel like I just make it up as I go tho orz.  r i p  us. Hahaha thought I was fine but wake up in pain
Even my feet are throbbing 
What fresh hell is this. http://www. animalsleepstories.com/main/art/    I'll be doing my screen printing presentation about this artist!! Im worried that as soon as I move I'll get cramps but I have to go to school and I already maxed out on aleve for the next several hours.. I didn't have the energy to take a shower so I put on make up to distract from my greasy hair . Monoprint looking pretty rad so far! Drawn layer next week  pic.twitter.com/IWEMekX8PY. hehe ; u; I'm glad it arrived safely!! Thanks for your patience!! <3. IT'S NOT EASY, BELIEVE ME I'VE TRIED - . Idk what happened but Cady can't walk through the doorway between the kitchen and dining room anymore??? she'll just stand there and cry til you walk over and help her???? ...tbh I think the photo I have on storenvy is a customer photo   and taken laid flat, too. Makes a fun short video snap/boomerang on Insta tho! She did this when we first moved in, then she was fine for MONTHS, and now this?   Ghosts are definitely a possibility. Pretty sure we had a ghost cat at our last residence. It's funny this came up bc the lights have been flickering in the bathroom recently and last night once I was sure it was happening consistently I brought it up to my mom by saying, "The lights are flickering. It's definitely not me, and it's probably not a ghost.". yeah, I feel similarly #stayinyourpLANE (ofexistence). a couple of artists and writers I really admire liked that customer photo I RT'd earlier and I think my soul left my body a few times. hhhhh I have a paper to write
I might do it
tomorrow...............
It's..she specifically said she didn't want opinion papers and that we'll be marked down for saying I and to use examples and evidence..then the prompt is mostly subjective and unrelated to the reading..please.. Stop me.......... pic.twitter.com/gIPliviG21.

Probably just hormones and back 2 school stress .. 
gotta go write that paper first. Dndjdjdn me too Mai!! ALSO I SAW IT WAS YOUR BIRTHDAY AND I DIDNT SAY ANYTHING BC IM AWFUL!! HAPPY BELATED BIRTHDAY!! Ehhh someone give me the motivation to write a paper and get my ass into town for class...it's so sunny too..makes me wanna go outside even tho it's cold but my dogs getting a bath so I don't have a good excuse rn. I had the most normal sleep last night it was nice pic.twitter.com/M7zUfNV1gf. Hey. It's almost. VALENTINE'S DAY? My boyfriend's never home this time of year so I forget sometimes;;. AJGOTDHFH I asked my mom what font was good for this paper since it's a bit shorter than it probably should be and she started listing about five fonts and their relative sizes. this is so relatable.. I believe in u... I've been in a bit of a funk the past couple days but I'm starting to feel a bit better now..tho I'm worried art history will bog down my brain . DANG THIS TWEET REALLY BLEW UP.... I've definitely gotten some sales and follows because of it   Thank you so much. If you order again in the future write smth in the notes and I'll throw in a special thank you!! :3 c. LMFAOO ME TOO I'm over here like damn my own posts of my work don't get this much attention like 90% of the time . I'M DRAWING THE KIDS IN THESE OUTFITS RN THIS MAKES ME SO HAPPY? I was looking at this illustration the other day like 'damn what a missed opportunity' so I'm glad someone fixed it!! * U*. lrt Cute!! Also I like that shirt, it's interesting! :O. hey guys I know it's not 2008 but I wanna cosplay Maka......... lrt wahh I wish I'd gotten into stuff like that when I was younger! I think those voice fanblogs that read fics or fan comics are pretty neat! (I know that's not what this is, I'm just talking about like..casual voice acting). Heh I kinda wanna try things like this but I get so embarrassed even just by myself?!  Thats probably one of my least favorite qualities abt myself - not trying new things bc I assume I will be (or that I definitely will be bc it's new) new things. I LAUGHED SO FUCKING HARD AT YOUR CAPTION.  thank u for this blessed image. God this boy just can't keep both his titties covered can he . HE DOESSS!! I like his outfit . LRT Help my friend get these killer designs into production   The first 24 hours of a Kickstarter are really important plus there's early bird tiers .  /pats u. I'm still in bed I did a bad job at Today. Another big bundle of packages going out!! Thank y'all for your patience with me!! I threw in extras w all the late ones  Just a small handful left to do tonight pic.twitter.com/AGpVposL0F. why is the soul eater op such a freakin bop dood. I even did some package doodles this time!! A FEW DAYS AGO I WAS SO BACKED UP I JUST FUCKING THREW THEM OUT THE DOOR AND FORGOT LOOOL. I LOVE oni Kirishima so don't take this next statement the wrong way but
His oni horns kind of look like
When the dye starts to wash out of your hair first so your ends go blonde.... I think it'd be cool if people offer to pay you bc if they didn't find that image that you created then they'd be paying for the tattoo to be designed anyway ! I'm glad they asked your consent tho! I know some artists who explicitly DO NOT want their work tattooed on people but then when people do it like..what do you do then? D:. Oh :( a package got returned to me! omg the response to pussycat! kirishima has been wild so I GUESS IM REALLY NOT FUCKING AROUND ABOUT THAT SET...I know I said I wasn't anyways but..gotta give the people what they want. /SHAKES U I BETTER GET A SMILE NEXT PAGE NICOLE. Let Kirishima have fun again pic.twitter.com/T6RGC8svp4. FEISTY BOY pic.twitter.com/Shp01CfCt8. Jirou was so cute this chapter! I should give her more attention. LRT DONT LET HIM HAVE IT. I wanted to draw KiriBaku doing each other's make up but I have like 3 pieces going rn and it looks like the fandom has it covered   I'm very grateful. Mmmmmmm this package that came back says it was refused? Bruh. Hey y'all I love to suffer so here I am again

*UNOFFICIAL*100% FAN/VOLUNTEER RUN * NOT FOR PROFIT pic.twitter.com/5bKdsSqVRN. hahaha Well I hope to draw some more since I'm going back to a con where it was popular last year!! I think it was my first manga too?! First or second! Gotta make our own content in the year 2018. FDJIDFHDTFH I FORGOT there was a fraudulent charge and I was told not to mail the package but I mailed it yesterday by mistake  sdihghfgh. I gave my shop a long overdue makeover! >:) Looks good, yeah?
 http:// cambrasine.storenvy.com /   pic.twitter.com/hx7qekk3lw. Thank you!! It had been a couple years since I last updated the banner/bg orz. Thank you for your support!! I'm glad it arrived safely :) and sorry for my messy note haha. YOOO WHAT I LOVE @_meccchi 's work ! I didn't know you two know each other! . *grabby hands*. YEAH WHAT THE HELL CAN I GET THAT STICKER TOO SOMEHOW DUDE ILL PAY U $. !! Hey, it's my birth month too!! \o/ And I ended up with it by coincidence, too!
I'm glad it arrived safely!! Thank you for your support + enjoy~!!  . I forget what Bakugou's hair looks like every time?! I love Crona 
Theyre relatable cause I also can't deal w anything   voice is cute too!! I'm watching the English dub . Redrew a couple official arts and doodled a Maka! Trying to learn how to draw the soul eater kids  pic.twitter.com/HbkwCBagz7. Yeah :( The girls need more love!! Tsuyu is really popular in the US but.. /looks at pile of Uraraka charms...please love her.. Nice!! And with resin you can sand down the imperfections anyway :). Ohh!! Sorry for assuming - I've only ever used resin! I'm excited to see the results! So far the only thing I've said aloud today is, "Wow that's a nice-looking chair," about a drawing of a chair. I got a pretty good response to my soul eater doodles which is bad bc now I feel like I can justify making merch . Oh my god the like about extras is GOLD pic.twitter.com/xXVrrGLLA5. The results of the poll look solid but consider: do you want a lot of commissions? Or a lot of requests so you can pick your faves? Or is the payment for your time more important so you should charge a bit more, Which will also help reduce the#if you're too popular! Just things to think about! Pricing yourself is hard so good luck!! . I LOVE MAKA AND SOUL BUT CRONA IS MY UNEXPECTED FAVE TOO . Omg maybe I'll reward myself by making merch when I finish.. :o I'm like 1/4 of the way thru so I'd like a better idea of what's going on w these kids first . Pet peeves: maka cosplays that don't have the slightly poofy sleeves :(. I WANT POOF GIVE ME POOF. Poof :(. Ok for the pussycats set I did Bakugou, almost done w Kiri, and started on Deku. Idk if I'll get thru all these kids so vote? LEVELING UP
 https://www. youtube.com/watch?v=LWGJA9 i18Co   …. SERIOUSLY when do they have time to make music if they're making these videos? Or is it vice versa?! hahaha. THIS ONE HAS DOGS  https://www. youtube.com/watch?v=nHlJOD YBLKs   …  holy shit
I think you're right tho hahaha. THIS IS A GREAT CONCEPT. I've always had a soft spot for these two too .  so..I heard you like Soul Eater.. pic.twitter.com/6THhF4csm3. Ok I'm at dollar tree and these packs of hot dogs are 25 cents and I'm Suspicious pic.twitter.com/08u5D47via. LRTS LOOK AT MY SUCCESSFUL FRIEND !!! MORE AND MORE BEAUTIFUL THINGS ARE GETTING UNLOCKED PLEASE GO CHECK IT OUT. i'm this close to pulling the trigger on maka cosplay...... IM SO GLAD YOURE GETTING THE ATTENTION YOU DESERVE AND KICKSTARTER DID NOT FAIL U !!! <3. PRETTY. Bully me. LMFAOO I  was like "Finally, someone calling me out on my bullshit" . I MADE...A THING  
You can get it as an acrylic charm at  http:// cambrasine.storenvy.com    \o/
I haven't yet figured out how I want to draw my love, Crona, but I will not give up! pic.twitter.com/SI13YBdvaB. Why do we do this. The best part of being into something for way too long . AU where people can just be happy about sports without overturning cars 

This sounds so reasonable and YET....  oh!! I'm glad I could add some happiness to your morning ~. Trying to figure out if I should make pussycats charms 2" like usual or 1.5" so they fit in the gacha like the matsuri ones do.. Omg it says Fe... omg seriously you should have seen how many takes I did of my flip thru..and then I couldn't even share it bc it was too big bc I was too slow . THANK YOU (and the others) FOR HUMORING ME LAST MINUTE <3. please y'all are unlocking stretch goals faster than you can think of them LMFAOOO. this is true but sometimes gacha gets hectic as it is ; n;. I am on my FIFTH semester and for the FIFTH TIME anime club meets on a day I don't have class . There's still a handful of extras for grabs btw! It goes from Feb 2018 - Jan 2019 so if you hurry you won't miss out~  http:// yearoftheunderdog.bigcartel.com   https:// twitter.com/asunnydisposis h/status/960616424728227841   …. Lrt luckily we haven't had any missing / damaged reports yet \o/. THANK YOU SUNNY!!   I'm kind of bullshitting my way thru my style identity crisis lately so I'm glad it turned out well . Doodle mock up for drawing over print.. I did more complex / line drawings but I didn't like the look so.. Poll in replies pic.twitter.com/vEWRmw86MY. (Image in original post). I will never be over how I learned about big three zine the day after sign ups. It would have given me the perfect excuse to finish this illustration I've had sketched for months.. I don't have pearl white so I'm gonna mix white and silver and see what happens /hard shrug. I have two more soul eater charms sketched /lays down
Why am I like this. I hope class is cancelled Wednesday sdfsdfg I could live without art history for a week.. my brother called and I lost all my energy. I CRASHED HARd. pretty sure I just channeled punimelt in drawing this it's so bubbly and cute? LRT I LOVE THIS SO MUCH. I'm making valentines for extra credit~! I'll post pics when I'm done and mail them out to the first takers u vu Not sure how many I'll make. I decided to have a quiet antisocial lunch today   also I wanted to sit in a chair with a back bc I'll be doing extra credit now . Ouch. I forgot how rough those 8 hour studio days are on the body . Fun with transparency pic.twitter.com/ZUBWiJH0mT. Style Inconsistency /lays down. !! I'll add to the list then!
> No ideas  
(thank you though !! ). Are you gonna make? . Some extra credit/Valentines stuff from today! I'll post my actual assignment prints tomorrow when the light is better. (The last pic has misprints but the texture is cool~) pic.twitter.com/vDIzdNl4Lx. PS I was gonna mail out my Valentines but uh I have to turn them in for grading on the 13th ...so..  S..sorry ... Also - These two made me think of you, @villainsbn   pic.twitter.com/PQWuYVro03. I'M A MONTH LATE BUT I JUST FOUND OUT FANGRRLZ IS DEAD AND I'M SO BUMMED OUT. /SNORT EMO VALENTINES FOR YOUR EMO SIGNIFICANT OTHER ...and VBN. this series of images has such an aesthetic  
...yes, I just complimented myself. THIS IS TRUE ERASED IS REALLY, REALLY GOOD!! I WASNT HERE FOR THIS but I'm glad everything's ok!! That must've been really stressful!!   Wishing you both a well deserved rest!!  . me: mmmmm...m...
mom: what are these sounds about
me: I'm trying to remember my measurements..no reason..(looking at cosplays)
mom: what, your boobs?
me: my . . . what?
mom: your butt? your waist? your hips? what measurements?
me: ...all of them?
We're . not on the same page . dgfshdrh maka is such a cutie but I love crona I can't decide who to cosplay? cosplaying a character whose gender is ambiguous makes me nervous tho? idk why? I just feel like my face is really......r.......ound? / I really like saying, "I don't know how to deal with it" tho . Guhhhh are you still around here  (MA) or did I imagine that? .. u ok buddy. I hope you feel better soon. Please snow..don't want.class. Have you tried Black Market and er there's some other zine fair type things like seekandfindboston/newzineland?   maybe not doujin but your comics!! But yeah...it's hard here . I've had mixed results w black market but it's not really 100% my scene - I'm going to try again soon now that I have enamel pins and screen prints! It's a bi-monthly thing. Next one is this Sunday if you wanna scope it out! Haven't tried the other bc again not a good fit for me but maybe better for you! Tables are cheapish so worth a shot. SUCCESS   feeling blessed rn thank u snow - you're never there for me when I need you but you really pulled through this time pic.twitter.com/H2r6sGfnuy. IM FULL OF REGRET NOT HAVING A TABLE now that I printed a ton of valentines yesterday   oh well.. it prob fluctuates depending on the time of year but the December pre-Christmas one is usually lit. No problem!! If I stumble across any more things I think would be good fits I'll send them your way!! My prof was like hey guys want some EXTRA CREDIT and I love to die so   quickly doodled and threw it onto the screen I was about to burn. I love the clever ones!! It's a cute idea and good for katscon.  There are ads up near my school sometimes since it's Cambridge so! Just dumb luck to have stumbled upon it haha Happy to help!! Lrt the most??? Beautiful ?? Thing I've ever seen?? 11 x 17 is most popular, 11 x 14 and 12 x 18 are also common if you wanna go slightly bigger or smaller. LRT FUN FACT I LOVED KIM POSSIBLE. I was upset when my brother was adamant that she was a redhead cause I wanted her to be brunette like me . Mhm!! <3 Everyone has different preferences but a lot of the time I get the all too relatable "I have no room on my wall!" so veteran con goers don't always want bigger prints, but they are definitely good for catching attention/luring folks over to the table~. Cady turns into a statue if you put the cone on her  pic.twitter.com/AlMxvFRDwR. dang y'all I got one of those headaches that isn't painful enough to be able to justify taking medicine but bad enough that it's hard to concentrate. Ugugu a nice thought   .. but if I take it too much I'll build up a tolerance and or destroy my stomach lining :(  so! Ice pack and water it is... Ohmygod one thing I'm particularly bad at with a headache is math. I could not figure out what size these were on my own and had to talk it out..
Me: I cut a 12 x 12 sheet of paper in half so that's 6x6 but the shape is a rectangle! 
Mom: jenn...12 x 6..
Me: TWELVE!!! SO TURNS OUT I made a good number of Valentines so I'm gonna sell some and submit the rest for grading \o/   Now up at  http:// Cambrasine.storenvy.com      GLITTER!! pic.twitter.com/D5Ba9uuGCL. she can't walk thru this doorway alone again all of a sudden?! Photographic proof to follow up a recent tweet pic.twitter.com/ISIyoIKLgH. QUALITY FACE  (also, quality shirt!!  ). YOU NEED Double Deco Bag !! Windows on both sides!  https:// gocart.jp/ap/item/i/A0GC 00007SHF   …  I have Large but it comes in this bigger size if ya need. also SO MANY GOOD BOYS!! * U*. I did a series of 7 monoprints for screen printing! These three are my favorites u vu I was pretty scared of this technique since you gotta be FAST and NOT OVERTHINK (things I'm not Known For) but the results are really cool!!  pic.twitter.com/qMIQIdh8Lh. There's --- hold on I'll find the link * U*. CUTE HUMAN CUTE CAT. also yes we moved in in September and no we still don't have our molding put up OTL. THANK YOU!!   IM ACTUALLY REALLY HAPPY W THEM which is funny bc I ended up changing my vision a lot as I went thru it. I was reading the responses to today's chapter on Reddit and someone said "can't wait to see this animated in 20 years" and I laughed aloud. Tail!!! Wag!! . Can't believe it's a full 24 hours later on this headache..it's gone up and down in intensity but never gone so I'm gonna take medicine now ...but I'm pissy about in u nu. Wahhh my school put out a cool internship but I'm definitely not qualified yet orz Someday.. I JUST FUCKING DID THIS TO SOMEONE TOO. Found some stuff while cleaning including this from @mistysmistakes  !! (ps I JUST SAW CHARM VERSION W MEIDO REVERSE And I need it?! QCK?) pic.twitter.com/vR4LyfNa6Q. Also!! Look! The three of us are "Featured Vendors" for @QCKamikaze  !   Pretty cool, huh? @mistysmistakes  @unagicakee pic.twitter.com/nYMV8mVYCB. \o/ NICE! Jennie tries not to seem too emotionally invested by writing "well" twice in one tweet DRSGOJGHDFH. Hehe   Surprise! Well, you would have all my kiris but that one so far so I thought I'd do ya a favor ;) haha Glad it arrived safely! LMFAOO I knew you were gonna be unhappy w that photo .  noooo no worries!! I've enjoyed meeting and chit chatting with you~~. Hehe Yeah they chose one of my newest photos! . It's cool how we're all in a line too giving off those pinky purple vibes . NDJDJD WELL ITS UNEXPECTED WHEN SOMEONE ORDERS TWO SO I NEVER SEE THE QUANTITY usually I'll only notice by seeing the price and being like THAT LOOKS WRONG. Djdjshsjs that would be lovely!! Not sure where in TX ya are but I applied to Akon and will be applying to San Japan too! Aaa I got into both last year but missed both (medical issue and Harvey) but maybe I'll be lucky enough to get in one or both again . Expectations: I think it'll be a little big, but it should be ok
Reality: pic.twitter.com/iIxBO6YJCM. AA THATS AWESOME!! Congrats!! Ohoho exciting . My friend and I saw it and agreed like no it's not the best film ever made by any means but IT WAS SO FUN TO WATCH? Had a good time!! Lrt this too!! If you're making a zine like an ART BOOK and want it printed then you're prob gonna need a couple hundred $ minimum. If you wanna make a ZINE ZINE then they're free/cheap to produce bc traditionally they're made by YOU using a photocopier + stapler if you need it. Make whatever you want I think OP was just trying to point out that if you're set on making an art book and are providing copies for your contributors (which you damn well SHOULD, they're making the thing with you) and need some to sell then you're gonna need a few hundo to start. LRT HE DID A REALLY GOOD JOB YESTERDAY aaa. (And that if you don't make that $ back? it's *your* burden..I think that's the real cautionary tale here). (And, for people who are really not thinking, if you don't get enough/any preorder $ to at least provide contributer copiers then u gotta shell that out yourself and if you don't then everyone just worked so hard for literally nothing...and will probably be upset w u  ). (And you'll be sad too  ) ok!! End//. I'm a little busy w orders lately ; u; the shipping is a pain in the ass, but..having orders is nice..thank you guys  I'm glad you like what I'm putting out! I DONT WANT THIS POST TO COME OFF AS SNARKY SO PLEASE DONT MISINTERPRET IT IM GENUINELY CURIOUS..how many yoi zines do y'all think are in existence in this moment? The latter! And wow yeah probably tbh. I'm gonna guess like. 75? There's some in other countries we prob haven't accessed too.. HOLYFUCK. THATS SO SCARY FOR DOUJIN COLLECTORS IMAGINE HAVING TO SORT THRU THAT. I agree but I made one so I feel like that disqualifies me...even tho (softly) we were first   heheh. It's cool that people have thought of so many themes tho!! I just feel like I'm worried for their success.. IM DYIN MINE ISNT ON HERE. But wow they had to make a whole site about it . LMFAO I JUST IMAGINE SMTH LIKE THIS THO: sort by > victuuri > 3000 results . Yeah.. ; n; i mean people are free to create what they want and it's always good to create things but I don't want them to be disappointed/have a deficit. MY GOODNESS.. Yeah if you're in it for the $ at this point you're in it for the wrong reasons . Hmm ; n;  ...Mmmmmm......... Well. I wish them luck..I'm gonna ..I'm staying out of zines (unless I'm really excited for something) for a lil bit anyway and focusing on school and making whatever I want \o/. Yes!! You can even print one sheet and then fold to make a tiny tiny one! WOW YOUR PHOTOS ARE SO BRIGHT!!  Thank you for participating and changing the glasses !! . this video is way too relatable /lays down. If you want to make it, make it! Everyone has a different hand so it will be unique because it's you making it, y'know? Or if you don't want to share it then just making it for yourself can be therapeutic too~. hehe well your color choices definitely inspired the cover - the teal really pops!! can't believe I almost drew deku without his red shoes ???? I'm getting more convinced my phone is listening to me..last night I remarked that I missed my old art history teacher (by name) and now there's an ad for a company I've never heard of before that's the same as her surname... spoopy. Your art is the same - amazing - no matter what age you are! I do think it's pretty stunning for 17 tho just bc you get a general handle on skill level and ages of artists you know and of yourself and subconsciously build an idea of what stage someone is likely at at what age. But in the end you're still producing the same great work whether you're fifteen or fifty and you'll only improve as you get more experienced and that's what really matters! . My mom is super angry today for no obvious reason and it's stressing me the fuck out . Had some nights like this . HDFNDISNSH SERIOUSLY NEW JERSEY DRIVERS ARE THE WORST I HAVE ENCOUNTERED I feel like I almost died ten times during AnimeNEXT. ehh I sent a message that was probably a little too apologetic but I wanna be done with this so............ /lays down. lrt I want four thousand of these. ehhh todoroki is up next but I can't draw him for shit/. I never like how my Todorokis come out.... ; n;. sometimes I wonder if I should be in the animation program. .....it's..ridiculous that at 21 I feel like it's too late in my life to try all sorts of things..... like 'there's no way I have the time/energy to learn it now and i'll never be GREAT at this age' which is silly bc I know there's always examples of people who started something late and became thE BEST but..yeah......it's hard not to feel this way. also I don't like trying new things bc of course I won't be good right away and I get SO embarrassed..even just by myself or with people I'm really close to.. I tried something new recently but it went badly so I only told 2 people and didn't show anyone sdfgerddhf a shitty trait. SORRY FOR A NEGATIVE THREAD just thinking out loud here.. TT A TT I'm glad you like him!! He's a popular boy, I just prefer how other artists draw him > how I draw him/?? I'll do my best on this one too tho!;;.  I'm waiting til I finish more to post... pic.twitter.com/u1vuj8GT19. Mm I know it's not a reasonable thought, it's just hard to break out of? Or if I want to keep doing the things I'm doing (school, drawing,AA/online store,etc.) then I would have to really carve out and commit time if I wanted to add something and I feel I'll just psych myself out. alright enough with the quarter life crisis for now i'm gonna go draw LOL. I had to go check what this was and I was not disappointed . PFF...I... I HATE TO BURST YOUR BUBBLE... But I've been posting on my Instagram story :3 c. Mostly just trying to avoid posting two with no lnik, getting a ton of RTs, posting the full set and links, 2 RTS LMFAOOO THAT TENDS TO HAPPEN SO.. But yes! Your boy is up next! (Well, I'm haflway thru uraraka now but). LMFAOOO SLOPE STYLE KID IS SO CUTE he's just freakin out he keeps sitting down pffhfh. Yeah!! This definitely applies to me in some ways but I think it'll be a lil bit longer til I reach the level of not-fuck-giving i'm looking for hahh. Yes!! I know.. It's hard to choose!! I wish I had the stamina for three dozen hahah. /changes faces on charms 7000 times bc style crisis. YEAH like they didn't has eyelash lines and now deku and uraraka look good w them but bakugou and kiri dont and i'm gonna diehrgdotfhgkgjfHKGJDTYFJHG. and just generally they're a lot cleaner bc now i'm in the swing and i'm like..re....do?....cries. you can probably tell from my tweets this past week or so but I'm having A Time lately.. sorry y'all don't mean to bring negativity to your TL <3. THE MOST FRUSTRATING THING IS LIKE..there's not 1000 responsibilities slaying my ass rn I should be ok but I feel worse?????????/@my brain: how do u work
I hope you feel better too ; n; <3. Yeah I think it just feels bad bc I don't even know why I'm all eRDGJFOSJG lately........ THANK YOU THO <3 I should make separate art/personal twitters but i'm too .. .l...AZY hahahaha. UPDATE HE
IS
 LOOKIN REALLLLLYYY CUTE TDHDGJ https:// twitter.com/cambrasine/sta tus/962476887271464961   …. my hand is cramping but i'm almost done.......give me strength. prime content from me - art posts at 3 AM .  thank you min!! This is accurate. You know it's getting serious when given names are coming out   Excited to see which way the next page pans out bc I can foresee two different outcomes . I'm 9000% sure I posted my charms to twitter and only twitter yet the post doesn't exist and this can only mean one thing: the internet gods want me to shut the fuck up and sleep .. See ya tomorrow!! ^^^^ I did this, thank you Misty!!  Take a hint, dude. { RTs   } Who else is counting down the days to season 3? 
You can get these cuties at    http:// cambrasine.storenvy.com     

P.S. Scars will be on the correct side as charms - I just made this gif for kicks~ pic.twitter.com/dj1XgIT7JX. ( Here's an alternate version if the gif is killing you   )
You can get these cuties at    http:// cambrasine.storenvy.com      pic.twitter.com/sfLcSvUfC3. THANK U MAI   I'm also picky about how people draw my best boy so this means a lot   In the end I think Todoroki is my favorite of the set !! I made a tweet putting down my todorokis but I think he's my favorite of the set  now?!   @starstarparfait. Shsndjdjd   Thank you Jeanini!! Your stuff is so cute too so this means a lot ! IM GLAD I DID YOUR BOY JUSTICE!!  Heheh We were blessed with so many tiny todo smiles a few chapters ago so I was inspired . Iskddnjd NOOO U SPOIL ME!! I'll just throw him in :3 c. I have cons the next few months so they'll be available (just on and off between in stock and preorder) but I'll be placing my order at the end of this month!  And thank you!! He turned out to be my favorite in this sit too . Mmmmmmm fine u can buy Bakugou but I'll throw in kiri . LMFAOO those two words are so unusual  together  . 55 days . I know!! Him and Bakugou were missing for so long but omg it was worth it .. Camie and Inasa are growing on me too . Thank you!! yesss so close and yet so far . Jdndjsbs I wasn't in chatty mode so instead of talking to this local illustrator I hadn't met before like a normal person I just bought something, threw $ at them, and left   oops.. Should I add indulgent big 3 charm to pussycats set? Omg wishing I went to your school right about now . Pfff I had a request for Mirio too and the very first sketch I made was those three so . Sndjdjsn This!! Tbh it was so muggy and loud in there - I wanted to talk to you more but I was too overstimulated too  So I'm gonna ramble here if that's alright! I used to get really nervous at shows but now I'm able to enjoy myself!Sometimes the noise is still overwhelming tho. Anyway, I really enjoy your work and it was exciting to encounter someone I hadn't before! I'm also really happy for the postcard bc I love that illustration but couldn't justify the big version on your table bc what is wall space . If you want to try a bigger show but not suffer at a 40k attendance Boston Comic Con, I would suggest MICE! I think your work would fit really well there. Or Another Anime Con in NH if you wanna try the artist alley scene! Both those apps will go up over the next few months. Tfw you have to look up your own boyfriend's address on your third-party shipping service account . This is fucking ridiculous. You were just trying to help and just bc the Internet made zine mean a whole range of things ain't your fault   I can't believe days later people are still giving you shit?! TBH I was surprised when you deleted it bc it wasn't that big a deal to me.. People completely misinterpreted the point...INHALES... Well..take your break. Maybe have someone purge your account of harrassing DMs/mentions before you return? I hope you feel better when you come back. We'll be waiting for you!! . I'm glad it arrived safely!!  Everyone worked hard so I hope you enjoy it~~. Yeah..I think the problem with both Black Market + MICE is .. there's no space at either of these dang places!! At least at cons they usually give you sufficient room behind your table so you can breathe - I usually feel more comfy behind my table than in front of it . But yes! Sounds good! Good luck with everything! I hope to see you around more and it was nice to meet you!! Omg I love how fluffy this is!! ...In more ways than one! . So precious!!  Gosh she has so many outfits tho it's tempting to make a hundred . Djfndjdn :( I wish I could help but that literally is the cheapest method now   I remember the good ole days when I thought $7 was ridiculous.. SNORT @hipstersparrow pic.twitter.com/IQOP5TiPoq. Yooo good!! mail!! day!! I'll post pics later . Hehe sorry the doodle isn't a masterpiece but I'm glad you enjoyed it   Thank you again for participating!! Lrt pssst guys I still have a few calendars left!! I BOUGHT CLOTHES I FEEL GUILTY BUT THEYRE CUTE.  something really good happened and was immediately followed by something really bad . dfhsdgsifjg THANK YOU!! And I'm glad!! please support me making charms for decade old anime  pfff.  I'm glad you like him so much!! Have I seen your bag yet, I can't remember? Pssst where are you looking at these rugs? . Aaah of course it is! They have so much cool stuff.. thanks!! She's really playing it up tonight pic.twitter.com/RI9SrR1Ioa. I don't typically pay close attention to the numbers but I was thinking of celebrating somehow and I've been on the verge of 1500 insta followers for so many days now and I keep getting new followers but the number keeps going down . CADENCE pic.twitter.com/apfBSTbSrg. Sometimes I think about how my grandma's cousin drove a limo for a while and drove Fall Out Boy and didn't get an autograph . dasfsdighfg I've just been fiddling around in here for hours I can't decide what I wanna do for this weeks assignment. I kinda wanna go home and come back later but it's such a waste when it takes me 45 - an hour each way to get in and outta here. OH!! NICE!!   I'm glad it was helpful to you~~. Aaa I'm glad it all arrived safely!! (And unbent! I always get nervous sending prints  ) Thank you so much!!  aa I'm glad!! Enjoy!! Only 4th week and I'm already getting fed up w the screen 1 kids..bucket of water next to my backpack, moving my stuff +taking the space when I was half set up, all my tabs w tape already on them go missing, ink on literally EVERY piece of equipment today from squeegee to spatula. Please...clean up after yourself...be considerate of other people..these shouldn't be new concepts . My mom bought plants today and one came in this ugly thing which I am arguing doubles as an ugly hat pic.twitter.com/6vH0MuLGI9. \o/ pic.twitter.com/743ecavmys. Last one!! Pardon the wrinkles~ pic.twitter.com/oOBOzsVt8V. Also I'm pretty sure this is @Iagann  'a fault ???  pic.twitter.com/lkLu8dvCYB. Thank you! It was a good shopping day \o/. Thank you!! Thank you! It's my mom's from the 80s  ! When you're playing dress up then remember you got an art history paper due tomorrow pic.twitter.com/lxUPrk9ckA.  I learned from the best!! I ...a few years ago yellow was my least favorite color..I've come a long way. Good things keep happening but I'm just so confused. Things go badly
Me: whining 
Things go well
Me: suspicious whining. This has been the most ridiculous series of events to ever transpire. THIS HAS BEEN A WILD RIDE FROM START TO FINISH BUT I HAVE AN ANIME BOSTON TABLE NOW SEE YOU FUCKERS IN MARCH i'm so relieved I don't have to stay in a hotel and line up at 7 AM i'm literally gonna cry now. ME TOO ??? THIS THING IS SO BIZARRE IM WORRIED BUT HAPPY? YEah..I'm.....I hope they didn't add more tables..maybe they just waited to send these or gave up on people suddenly?..I hope... BUT YES! I'll see you there! And maybe we can exchange more screen prints! ( Though hopefully they'll sell better than they did at An*meNYC   ). Do you have a table or attending!? :O. I guess so!! AB is *~usually~* solid sales wise so hopefully I can get some more off my hands hehe I'm in screen II this semester so I'll have more too! SEE Y'ALL SOON. I feel bad bc I overheard a classmate asking my prof if this artist qualified for our presentations but I decided on her two weeks ago and already started my research and collecting images and wrote her on the sign up sheet earlier in the class (but she didn't know her real name). I've been trying to be better at advocating for myself lately so first I relented, said I could pick some1 else, then my brain yelled@me for giving up when I had already started + my classmate hadn't but .. it feels bad bc it feels like I took advantage of the same quality in her that I'm trying to dispel within myself? like I know she probably also actually cares but was relenting too..and bc I am trying to squash this quality it's still there, underlying and makes me feelsselfish? WOAH!!! FUNKY!! Omg yeah this was a huge problem this year.. but YAY! congrats !! Wheeze I know .. it was bc I used her real name and not her handle that she didn't realize they were the same .. I'm just worried she hates me now   When I get anxious I tend to sound kind of airheaded so I hope I didn't come off poorly.. Thank you for the reassurance tho . Ohh!! Were you able to get off the waitlist too?? (softly) the an*me boston situation.. I'm happy myself and my friends were able to get off the waitlist..and I saw lots of others say that yesterday too and.. ...I'm...suspicious... please tell me they just waited and did it all at once and didn't add extra tables. I don't know where this rumor originated but it's WORRISOME. But possibly completely false..but still..a lot of people got emails last night.... I ran out of the adhesive to put my Valentines together :(. I don't think my valentine is coming today..   oh well. Aaa I'm glad it's coming in handy!! Thank you so much for pulling through for me .

PFf my prof was like lets discuss next week and i'm gonna trust her on that one so I don't fuck up a bunch of shirts. No point in deSTRoying THem on my own. lrt I don't *love* it of course but hey I get it if you wanna resell something from me but bruh if you mark it up that's SO not cool!! I kept seeing BTMH zine goodies being resold for prices that were not appropriate given the cost for bundles > n<. Cady sat down really close to me and I was like wtf but then she laid down to cuddle so that's adorable pic.twitter.com/XHOzjBt1ZQ. I'm completely bullshitting this paper.

Aaaa I wanna commission this cosplayer and the rate she said was reasonable but yknow it's still a lot and I'm trying to feel ok abt spending the $ on myself but its hard  like I would never pay that much for clothes I could wear every day so it's hard to justify for cosplay .  reply w doodle requests idk what to do w myself rn pic.twitter.com/SbzkjfAhBp. As if my sketchbook isn't filled w him already . Caitlin idk who the duck that is. ITS BEEN A BAD NIGHT FOR DRAWING I'm gonna stop bc forcing it is Not Working.

My only criticism of Soul Eater (mind you I'm not a very analytical watcher/reader) is EVERY TIME SOMEONE IS LEGIT BLEEDING THE FUCK OUT I'M SO SURE THEY'RE DEAD AND THEY'RE ALWAYS JUST LIKE 'don't worry, they'll be fine' and then they are and I'm so. THIS REPLY IS COMING AT YOU 3 WEEKS LATE BUT I need one of these at AB :O . Eeeep!! How exciting!!! . Based on what I read about another big con's intake though..it's not impossible   Harvey made me unable to attend last year so I'm trying again!! . PHEW. Got my form in. Now I breathe. WELL AB got like 600 apps in one minute one year and San Japan's cut off is 775 or smth and I know their form is longer but I AINT TAKIN ANY CHANCES. I AM STRONGGg
I think we all need badges that say "I survived AB 2018 sign ups". I would honestly hand these out if I didn't think it'd get me in trouble /hit. time to go update my portfolio so san japan doesn't think my ass is lying abt 3d shit. I WAS JUST THINKIN THAT
I don't think the organizer would be keen on it.......... (the type of foolery that could get you blacklisted? maybe?). Yeah;; I'm not sure how good of a sense of humor they have ; n; NOT THAT IT WAS FUNNY TO EXPERIENCe...but I think the ribbons would be really funny................ so we can nod to each other abt mutual suffering. SJ: bitch is lying
me: NOOO LOOK AT THIS. AND THAT. I'M WORKING ON IT RIGHT NOWWw just let me finish the semester you'll see!!! guys today for the first time since ever I took two seconds and learned how to make my header less incredibly tall on wixsite and I am Much Happier. could fiddle with con portfolio site for literally ever. Imy hand is unhappy from doing too much clicking between presentation research/PowerPoint making and site editing..   I wanna draw tonight too!!! Dhdjdjsn I've been here before. Make sure to distract yourself! Maybe watch some happy/funny videos or tv show or smth! No shame but I think magic mug would be so funny bc maybe you forget for a moment and then you (or some unprepared coworker) go "oh...". OHMYOGOD THATD BE SO EVIL????? Like it could be a happy funny surprise to someone but also if they didn't know and were with someone or brought it somewhere...prank potential . POLL IN REPLIES !  Help me decide! pic.twitter.com/xdtyw4CI3g. Pic in op. I know I am Once Again putting in 3x the effort most of my classmates are but I WANNA DO A THOROUGH PRESENTATION esp after I had to advocate for myself to get to do this artist instead of my classmate orz. ALSO I DONT MEAN " NO ONE ELSE WORKS HARD " - it's like a powerpoint presentation for SCREEN PRINTING class so most peeps are like yep here's this person their stuff looks like this cool + i'm reading like half a dozen interviews and grabbing videos off IG to convert to gifs.. It's gonna be dope tho fight me pic.twitter.com/10iuKW3cmk. y'all I'm about two seconds from angry crying about the absolute bullshit that's going down about the developments they're building on the beautiful field down our quiet dead end street. Get ready for a thread. If you've been following me you may have seen me before complaining about how the 4 people who got to decide the fate of this field voted unanimously to buy the property for the town for recreation or conservation, then *~mysteriously~* a couple weeks later they all flipped. and sold it to a developer. "We need more senior housing" Everyone here is old as fuck you need some new blood in your town but whatever --- And so they pass on buying, approve a plan for developer to buy it and make 22 houses for seniors. Marketed as AFFORDABLE housing for seniors. AT $550K A PIECE. That's more than we paid for this 3+ bedroom house on the fucking lake ok. What seniors can afford 550k?! They start work right away digging up the fucking field and cutting down trees and I am very upset about the destruction. Then my mom points out hey there's a fuckton more than 22 septic tank holes in the field right now. My mom walked around the property today bc she doesn't give a fuck and knew some shady shit was going down. 31. They added NINE. And guess what? They go ALL the way out to the edge of the property all around. Which is a problem BECAUSE--. that developer signed an agreement with the town that they were gonna give the town 30% of the land. Mind you in the plans it was LANDLOCKED BY PRIVATE PROPERTY completely inaccessible to anyone - but now it's gone altogether. Anyways I love nature and hate builders and I just wanna cry but at least we are on the neighborhood email list and everyone is FUCKING LIVID. This email thread goes back to January and is full of wild shit. And what about the impact on the environment??? Destroying and building on the field and brush, chopping down trees right across from the woods. And right next to this pond -- this super clean pond you can swim in? And some people on the planning board were shocked by the new 31 number? Are y'all fucking *new* here? People are fucking sneaky and out for themselves and if you don't legally bind them to something they're gonna do as they please - and sometimes even if you fucking bind them. Also I'm so happy this neighborhood email chain exists and..I know everyone here is older but y'all this would be much more effective as a Group Chat .. this format just complicates things. i'm full of bureaucratic rage I need to redirect this energy. I am coming up with various phrases of greetings for my mom's debut into the e-mail thread "Wow, what a fucking nightmare" "'Sup" "Looks like we got a real shit show on our hands" ....So far she isn't liking them . lrt me rn. I guess somehow the shit he said wasn't legally binding so he could just say whatever to get people on his side and do whatever he wants now with no legal repercussions? I think giving the town 30% tho was signed about,..Will find out soon I suppose. This is the only logical solution at this point. Thank you Liz . PS LOOKS AMAZING. Yeah when I saw BNHA won best animation I was like ily but No   Like you said they put a lot of care into some scenes and not others. yikes!! Get well soon! Drinking water is the most important thing!!! I love the first page!! Excited to see where it goes~   Here to apply public pressure if you need . OHHHH ITS GOOd!! I liked it better the second time tho for some reason . Mm like they open w the history and the first time I completely didn't process it?Also just knowing everyone's roles made me understand some things that were earlier on better whereas the first time I was like why is so and so saying that to who and the accent wasn't helping. I took a nap and I hate myself. I was so tired I fucked up the math and set it for 2.5 hours instead of 1.5. I couldn't figure out why I was so tired and it turns out I only had four hours of sleep
So I decided to nap for 1.5 hours but since I was tired I hecked up and set my alarm for 2.5 hours and when I woke up to see that I was so upset that I laid in bed for another hour. Anyways don't be like me. me: I GOTTA GET MY ORDER IN IT'S THE 28TH ALREADY
the date: . 1st thought: WOW! D̶a̶t̶ ̶a̶s̶s̶  // That anatomy!
2nd thought: He has many different weapons! :o. Artist Alley Pro Tip; Don't try to place orders right after you wake up form a nap . Fuck you now I want this. LMFAOO WHAT IN THE WORLD THAT's A RANDOM ASS PAIRING ?? At least from watching the anime it seems that way .. Crona's always "MAKA...... Maka.... Makka......". Ohmygod give me a minute I finished YESTERDAY. ID SAY 10 YEARS LATE IS PRETTY CASUAL ALREADY. y'all i'm spending a long time on smth i dont need to do rn but if it works it'll look cool as heck.

They're just like hmmm $12 sounds like more than $10 . I wanted to make a screen print out of a drawing but since it's painted on 10000 layers the color separations were gonna be impossible but I figured out a way!! I really need to learn more about the program I've been using for almost a decade........ SDJOFGDGDFG THIS FILE IVE BEEN WORKING ON IS NAMED "_FINAL_PRINT" AT THE END BUT ITS 72 DPI. THIS MAKES ME SO HAPPY I made googly eyes an option in my shop for a while but no one wanted them :( but they were WRONG !!   Good luck!! . I HOPE THIS PRINT COMES OUT WELL cause it's gonna be the most layers I've ever attempted and if it turns out badly I wwill have spent many MANY hours on it. Thank you~~. EXCITED FOR MY FIRST FROSTED CHARMSSs. (I just placed the order). I...never in my life has my tummy bruised from hula hooping and I bruise pretty easily   Maybe you.r.e...doing it too hard?! OUCH! THE BUMPY KIND looks painful.... I have never seen those before, so I've used weighted but never bumpy.... Today had a lot (A LOT) of bumps but in the end my prints are looking pretty good so far at 4 of 7 layers \o/. Glow in the dark bg pic.twitter.com/ciO83At0SN.

That must be really disappointing.. I feel like a lot of people underestimate how much work it is to run one and then it becomes a let down for everyone..... LRT JUST REMINDED ME I was drawing a bunny helmet chara for a while but never did anytihng w them.. i wanna make merch but of Real People but I don't wanna do it for profit cause I feel that's a bit weird so.. help jennie figure out where this falls on her moral scale. lrts don't send them more bikes but omg.

People do make a lot of KPOP merch :o ... but even that feels a bit odd to me?? hm,..... figure skaters!! I wanna  make charms + give them...foil medals /hit. omg someone made plush of him?!! too funny!!  
I don't think I can feel comfortable selling for profit but I do wanna make them and I know if I make for myself some others may want them but I can't really justify handing them out bc $ to make so I'm tryna figure out what to do.. yeah no I don't feel comfortable selling for profit but I do wanna make them and I know if I make for myself some others may want them but I can't really justify handing them out bc $ to make so I'm tryna figure out what to do . .askin seems unlikely to get a reply/IM FUCKING SHY. LMFAOO I WILL BUT DONT HOLD YOUR BREATH cause if I get too in my head about it i'll never make them  . (softly) I want excuse to make foil charms.........

Ahh that's probbaly true too. to clarify ho don't do it is 'don't even draw them' not 'don't sell for profit' bc i'm not gonna sell for profit - I wanna make them + I know if I make for myself others may want them but I can't really justify handing them out free bc $ to make so I'm tryna figure out what do https:// twitter.com/cambrasine/sta tus/969672647192776705   …. i'm finally making minto charm and she looks different than the others but its been like TWO OR THREE YEARS SO IM JSUt...just let me llive.

Forgive my like spamming I just love this boy. um I'm like a little bit great at mixing colors? I mixed six out of the seven layers for this screen print and I'm only unhappy with one of them.  Thank you so much!!  I'm really happy with how these came out!! Wish I had made more than I did . Thank you so much!!  Converting it from a painting down to just a few colors did that, but the printing it all on a base layer of ink gave it even more great texture . I meant to do a split fountain fade on Chloe's hair but I chickened out bc I only had 9 prints and I didn't wanna ruin any   I wasn't a risk taker tonight . Yeah!!

Me: oh right. Being the first kiri zine is comparable to being the first Yuri on ice zine.. IM EXCITED TOO IM ALSO JUST DYIN also I thought I put certain things in the FAQ but I didn't / some I accidentally deleted so that's my bad LOL. It looks like we have mice again but they are very polite they didn't poop anywhere but they did steal my rabbit's pretzel treats so he's not happy about that. YES IM AN IDIOT / my friends are busy with their own projects but will help me vote on apps once I narrow it down   I've made several zines before and usually get stuck w the shop/finances/shipping bc of logistics so it's not much of a change. Thank you for the support!! I thought my mom was losing it and just couldn't remember how many treats she gave him but turns out no. Yeah I made the applications two weeks long but if this pace keeps up I'm gonna end it a bit early,,, for btmh we went thru like 470 apps and I don't wanna do that again LOOL. i e-mailed [redacted] (eyes glaze over). https:// kirishima-aishiteru.tumblr.com/post/171765141 471/   …  \o/. rgdhg TT A TT THank you!! I appreciate the offer! Everyone's been so kind already.. I'll do my best! hey y'all whats a reasonable number of apps to sort through ..... IM JUST TRYING TO FIGURE HOW SOON TO CUT IT OFF.. Yeah;; I think 300-350 is probably more than enough...... I have to guesstimate when I'll reach that anyways so we'll see LOL. Thank you!! TT U TT <3 YES he is! Can't believe I was almost *worried* about this for a moment there haha. LMFAOO THANK YOU FOR THE CONCERN EVERYONE.. I AM OK ILL bE SURE TO LET U KNOW WHEN THAT CHANGES  https:// twitter.com/cambrasine/sta tus/972949912521408512   …. Hi I have a lot of questions about chip size and distribution pic.twitter.com/GZfgPqaw8q. My favorite part of the application process is when you start having so many skilled applicants that you start to question if you, the host, are good enough to be in it . Here's a sleepy pic I took before Cady sat up, shook her head so aggressively that her big floppy ear slapped me in the face repeatedly, then laid back down and snuggled into my arm pic.twitter.com/lwLlYmRrV5. Tbh i was thinking yesterday we should hang out but then I remembered u have a jorb. But let's PEM soon since I was too stupidly depressed to ice. Oh shit ok. I CNANOT HANDLE THIS BLEP OGMYJDKDD pic.twitter.com/zpvp2Ksyzi. pic.twitter.com/zEZ4aH3mlL. Call out post for myself: I'm a slut for comics but never try to make them myself, except in my head where I map out panels until every millisecond has a panel and becomes Bad LOL I need to take a sequential art/intro to comics class but I'm Scared.. He probably watched from his cage like, "NoooOOOOOOOOO!!". SAPPY MULTI-PART TWEET 
Hey y'all! This is a call out post. I've seen a surprising volume of worried tweets abt this zine! I think its just because everyone is so passionate about Kirishima? I'm glad he has so much love.   I wish we could have hundreds of people in this zine,. I WAS JUST GONN SAY LET ME KNOW IF YALL HAVE IDEAS FOR A BIG GROUP THING WE COULD DO. Genius Chris. (PART 2) but it's just not practical for organization/printing.  

I'm proud of everyone for applying!   Be strong! The more you put yourself out there, the more times you get to participate in something cool, and the more used to dealing with rejection you'll become, too! LOL SORRY GUYS SIX MONTH DELAY ON THE ZINE GOTTA WAIT FOR THAT GOOD BOYS BIRTHDAY. (PART 3) Perhaps further along in the project we can create a week to celebrate Kirishima?! Where everyone can post their work using a specific tag, and each day of the week is one of the 7 forms of love from the zine?

Idea suggested/modified from the lovely @chriseatscandy. Ohmygod LOOL. "I'm sorry but.. this is something I have to do." pic.twitter.com/6w0bUO2MHP. I'll level with y'all I'm like low key about to cry over here.. I have to send this special boy back since they lost their sample in New Years chaos.../lays down Please wish him a safe journey!! pic.twitter.com/p5LyyPOwoC. What do you mean this wasn't a good use of fifteen minutes. I hope they'll send him back w the rest.. FIRST SPECIAL BOY. He's gone   I would've kept him to show at QCK and AB but then it would have been even more delayed for peeps who preordered and I wouldn't do that . cady is way more interested in the laminator box than the dog toy I bought her....is this how cat owners feel. sometimes i think abt how i missed starrycove's kirishima charm and how i'll never forgive myself. *dokidoki........ pic.twitter.com/NelRjJJ1mm. This is accurate. phew!! apps pace slowed down and I did a lot of sorting with my impartial third party so I'm feeling better about that :). I think smth exciting happened but I'm not sure so I'm just laying awake here at 6:30 am giving myself heart palpitations. Hi please don't die holy shit. Hnn I typically don't think enough about whether or not smth is real or fake leather but if it's labeled real I get so squicked out? An artist I've never seen before posted a selfie and they look exactly how I expected them to. This has no positive or negative connotations I'm just like "yeah seems right". I'm having pain on my right side aha. I bought nail polish for what must be the first time since ...2012? Beautiful pic.twitter.com/h7lweoE5fn. Sorry for the 6-7 AM stream of consciousness tweets y'all I'm gonna go back to bed LOL. ISNT IT EVEN EARLIER THERE?!    Have a nice day at work! Also I made the executive decision not to send those orders for the last few calendars until AFTER the storm bc 1. I don't trust u*ps for shit 2. They're made of PAPER and even if I plastic sleeve them I just...yeah... Can u get a refund. Or like, a meal voucher. It was a joke about your life being bad. ...I just woke up. Mmm I guess it *has* been 9,304 days..  
(A/N: I put a lot of effort into this tweet). I am so Content and Lazy. someone cosplay big three with me at AB TT A TT I need more motivation to make the accessories..I'm so scared......I'm really bad at crafting. I just set up a discord server all on my own. I feel like a big girl. @unagicakee. me, reading someone's zine idea: (squeaky) that sounds beautiful

I care. so much. ELSNRDTRYOHJTYJ. lrt me in a nutshell. For a moment I was blown away bc I thought the last two storms names (Riley and Skylar) were my brother's friend's siblings names but then I remembered it's Ryder not Riley and now I am disappointed. ok I really need the AB map bc 1. I need to see this shit 2. Gotta plan my display 3. It's weeks later than usual, the con is in like 2 minutes and most importantly, 4. I NEED TO KNOW WHAT ARTISTS ARE COMING AND WHAT GOOD GOOD SHIT IM BUYING. it's time for con season which means me vaguely recognizing people but not being sure who they are and acting like I do bc I don't wanna offend them, until I'm handed a business card or directed to their table and know who they are......I REMEMBER ART BETTER THAN FACES IM SORRY. gonna vague bc I'm mad for my friend but if u sign up to be a pinch hitter...+ get contacted to pinch hit...u can't be mad??? u literally checked a box that said u wanted this?? Did u..not know what it meant? Running a project+ppl dropping is stressful enough,no1 needs xtra salt. WOAHH! CONGRATULATIONS!! I'm sure you worked so hard for this! This is..very relatable. 
me: I gotta lose weight before AB so I can wear this bodysuit cosplay confidently
also me: eats almost the entire 3-serving bag of cookies in one sitting. I feel like I'm the only one who doesn't want rejection letters from zines? I'd rather...FORGET ABOUT IT AND BE ON MY WAY TBH ????????/  That be like "OMG IT'S AN EMAIL FROM--- oh.". ?! like why give me that tiny moment of hope followed by immediate disappointment when i could just forget and a month later be like haha whoops guess i didn’t get into that zine after all. I had a stupid idea for preorder bonuses and I'm gonna surprise y'all with this ridiculousness. Aaa yeah me too!! I'm way more likely to get sulky about it if it's right there in my face;;. Mm, I see that! I always send all at once tho and post when emails have gone out so people aren't waiting around! That's the worst - when conventions let people in one by one over the course of a day or multiple days and you're just there waiting waiting waiting TT A TT. OK I have no idea how to make Nejire's ankle or wrist things (....foam????) So I'm starting with HAIR TWIRLIES. Wish me luck.. any cosplayer's who have protips please@me TT A TT idk wtf I'm doing but aprile's gonna make me a beautiful suit so I gotta figure out the rest LOL. update: The weft is more tangled than before I combed it and i pinched the skin on the pad of my finger so hard it turned dark red and now I''m icing it https:// twitter.com/cambrasine/sta tus/973744188465598464   …. lrt the internet is a beautiful place. aaa congrats michelle!! <3 <3 <3. aaa I'm curious to see how the test curl comes out.. it's a bit fucked up bc it LOOKED SO GOOD but the chick in the video combed it after putting the hair gel in so we did that even tho it looked perfect before and doing that totally messed it up so esdhrttdfh. i'm also last minute ordering maka cosplay and hoping it comes in time for AB :3 c. Sad little test curl   Needs to be twice as thick, dry longer, wire support, etc. length/basic shape isn't bad tho pic.twitter.com/KAmT6oPtuG. It's 8 am I want a turkey sandwich.  these are very smart ideas which I will look into! Thank you!! . Gathers 4 billion reference photos, draws 0 thing. Can't decide if I want subtle or HIT U OVER THE HEAD vibes for this . I've had like 3 hours of sleep and I'm feeling super manic so instead of sleeping I drew usinf the back of one of this semester's syllabi and a broken crayon bc that's all I had in my room pic.twitter.com/lpmyuza8g5. Oh fuck I just remembered I have to be somewhere in like an hour and a half bad job jenn. Curl update!! WOW DRYING TIME MAKES A DIFFERENCE!! I just loosely put it back on the cone overnight and WOAH pic.twitter.com/5xY4Bc82kw. Yes!! This is exactly what I'm doing! Yeah the gel does give it that wet look which I don't love but I think it's for the best .. her hairs a bit darker than my wig anyway so I think it'll be ok. Afghikjdv was maybe gonna go see free! Today but I'm napping instead and Boston is far rip me. Who's ready to see me attempt a most radical move: drawing interior spaces?!
.....
 .... .....OTL. This is the most relatable shit I've ever seen. We need to just kick our own asses and START cause if you don't start you can't finish and if we don't keep making we won't ever get better/faster . Im so scared I'll fuck this up but my favorite zine idea calls for it so!! Maybe I'll do one interior and one outdoor (remake the piece I didn't like enough to finish for kiribaku zine) if I have time... why learn perspective when you can just bullshit it for 10 hours until it loose 'close enough'? I hear that 's what the cool kids do. i wanna make an enamel pin of kirishima's muscle arm clock but that sounds like a huge waste of $ and I'll have piles of them eternally LMFAOOO. just explained kiri's backstory to my mom and gosh why is he such a good boy i'm emo. omgg imagine.. ita bag not even for kirishima but just for his clock LMFAOO. An*meN*XT just emailed me like hey you're on the waitlist LOL NO SHIT I FIGURED THAT OUT WHEN U DIDNT EMAIL ME AN ACCEPTANCE TWO WEEKS AGO I thought this was a "you got OFF the waitlist" email . Omg why do I forget to apply for afest every single year... CONGRATS!! SEEING EVERYONE TWEETING ABOUT FREE IS MAKING ME SO SAD I just..did not have the energy for a two hour jaunt with three hours of sleep.... I wish these dang things were more than one day /lays down. this piece better make me level up bc i'm gonna pour my heart in ; n;. PFFf I'd have to make all my own merch . OH NO NEW MIRACULOUS how do i Find. I foUND IT IM GONNA WATCH IT IM DROPPING THIS ILLUSTRATION IM SORRY KIRISHIMA MY BOY I GOT ADRIENETTE TO SEE. HOT DAMN THAT WAS ONE HELL OF AN EPISODEEEEE I love how things are progressing/escalating this season TT A TT If they move that netflix date again I'll lose it..how the heck am I gonna binge this the day before Anime Boston?????? hah.a.........there's still a lot of work to do but I'm feeling pretty proud of this piece so far..... BUT SINCE IT'S FOR THE ZINE I WONT BE ABLE TO SHARE IT FOR SO LONG........ /lays down. sneak peek on my IG story. Of course it is (eyes glaze over) 

[con on the 17th] pic.twitter.com/Yuwqxtnjrw. Set up is in two weeks.. Still no map..   please............. Someone wrote in forums they're still letting in that many people off the waitlist.. if there's THAT MANY people still getting 1. Wtf happened 2. An acknowledgement or response or email update of any kind would be nice.  im sorry .. I am Losing All Hope. Yes . I accidentally invited missionaries over to my (Jewish) household... social anxiety: 1 me: 0. 1. OTL they have my address..I thought they were looking for $ to shovel....... 2. Yeah! I'm not really religious but raised Jewish, Jewish day school, etc. This face pic.twitter.com/riJ19bJDrc. can't believe the IRS is auditing my grandma post-mortum..... please stop making my mom deal with this.. he is..the whole bag. ..You're just gonna have to surround him with a hoard of tiny bakugous   That'd be such an aesthetic.. Drawing didn't go as well tonight..sometimes it's best not to force it and it's late anyway. Hey y'all, I'll be @QCKamikaze  tomorrow \o/ As always, it's my first con of the season, so please be gentle~
Unfortunately my charm order got delayed *~1 day~* aka just enough that it won't arrive in time, so no pussycats, new mews, souma - but I'll have all the old faves!  pic.twitter.com/sOCxWq3ONy. Me, every year, the day before QCK: fuck. ch 175 page one: nejire
me: !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! so many happy kiris this chapter feelin blessed. poor cosplayers must be like "OH CRAP ANOTHER ONE..." they'll go broke . Deku's such a good boy too. Gosh. I like the light-hearted gag villain idea but like Deku's thoughts...EVERYONE WORKED SO HARd...PLeAse..DONT........ color cover next time tooo aaa . Ok I just ordered a bunch of foam for nejire!! I've never made any props/accessories/anything out of foam before so pray 4 me. I mean I gotta cut and shape two rectangles and four strips this should not be..hard...shouldn't be.......... Cady got up on the couch for a better view of the sunset  pic.twitter.com/SLPJLOv47m. Tbh if I didn't have Queen City first each year I'd be a total mess for anime boston . Out here at QCK   Come say hi!! pic.twitter.com/hsMPCaoUcL. TT A TT   Aaa I'm so glad! I'll treasure my buggy apron!!! Fuuuuck ice pack, meds, sleep a - its 4 and I'm still in bed and my head still hurts. I did better sales wise than I thought yesterday so that's cool. QCK is always such a ???? lrt idk what this says but He Squat. OHHH! Thank you!! ; u; Tbh I was so sleepy I walked around maybe half of the room or less.. Maybe we can greet each other better at AB? . OHH I DID SEE THIS ACTUALLY AND as I walked by I said, "Empty tables? For shame!" aloud. . Oy!  . Hahahaha...haha...ha...hhhh  please. I specialize in passive-aggressive twitter names thanks. Best Friends pic.twitter.com/5Q1wsmN4y1. I miss Kirishima... pic.twitter.com/xoYeOQC1SJ.  but I'm lonely NOW. relatable. she sleep. she wanted to bite kirishima but she doesn't like the fluffy man I bought for her (pictured in op). photoshop's been seriously 10x as glitchy since they forced me to update. sigh. every time I drink from the bubbler at school I think, "Is this is? Is this what kills me?". i know nothing about the man who just delivered this food but he reminded me of mark ruffalo and so i like him. me, on experimental drawings
while drawing it: wow!! this looks cool!! revolutionary
two days later: what is this, this is bad. earlier cady farted approx 6 inches from my face

Starting your cosplay a week and a half before AB?  did you mean ME pic.twitter.com/5VKgWZ82zw.  aa thank you, Zambi!! Yessss!! My first time using he star/heart clips and they're sooo cute!! I always have biz cards out but tbh I get people who don't.. it's a waste of paper (stressful for me) - and of money when some people literally grab them without even looking at anything - just to collect them?, I feel like I'm ALWAYS re-ordering them, etc. THIS IS THE CUTEST SHIT IVE EVER SEEN . This cute bby fawn almost made my rage dissipate..almost.  !! What are your next cons?? What about Anime North? I can send it along w @unagicakee !! /volunteers friend for errand . Y'all are awful...but I've also done this 
Err damn I know some peeps going to AX but not well enough to ask them to hold onto smth for 4 months .  thank you Chris!!! Gee whiz I sure do love having a stomach bug and a midterm paper. wanna post qck trade haul but no energy to unpack zz.  I'll throw in smth extra when ya do :3. ow ow fuck my stomach's really fucked up why is this happening.....was it..high school germs from saturday? (Scream). me: IM SO EXCITED MY CHARMS ARRIVED WOW PHOTOS PRETTY KIRAKIRA
preorders: 'member us? mail time , binch
me: oh shit. (raises hand) me please. ; u; hehehe   I'm glad you like them~~. Oh? Like mystery packs or gachapon? General Mystery Packs: Since it's easter weekend I'm going to throw some overstock/retired buttons/charms/stickers in plastic eggs~ Gacha: I ended up making the pussycats bigger than capsule size, so only the matsuri charms will be in the gacha. See you there!! :3 c <3. Yep!! It's fun to play, and to watch ; u; 
mmm I'll probably just throw things in randomly and make them super cheap. (Screaming). Yum! This made me so angry but also laugh so I read this to my mom about "Yuuri clearly being a bottom" and she was like, "I must have missed that episode" 

But on a serious note people are awful I'm sorry. I'm avoiding my midterm by packing preorders you're welcome. Phew! I did all the packages I could without rummaging through my con bags from this weekend~ the rest may have to wait til Wednesday night;; Thanks for your patience <3. I have yet to be cursed with the concert wall so I feel like I'm definitely there this year but ~ who knows ~ . ; u; Thank you... I hope it's gone by tomorrow cause spring break is ~over~. (softly) wth I passed by this earlier but now I really wanna know.. Hmmmmmm  I can think of several ways this could go..... Y'all are killin me. it has been a year and a half since I ran a zine and wowee you kids really took everything to the next level huh? All these 80 pages zines with 5 charms and 4 stickets and 100000 postcards are stressing me out just by lookin at em. i’m so desperate to not write my midterm paper that i voluntarily packed orders, baked muffins, and emptied the dishwasher. I think this sometimes but I haven't made anything too bizarre or raunchy thus far. //VIIIBRATESS. my mom's laptop fan went on + she was like "ITS HAPPENING AGAIN..." and I tried to hold back my laughter bc turns out this is the "freaky" thing that made her think her "computer was going to explode" the other day and I-

update: she's convinced it's bing's website causing this. OH GOOD I started this essay and one of the two artists was working in 1980 and the cutoff was 1950 guess i'l go fucikdfignf fGHGHOJFG srHOGJHFNFG. screaming. I really really REALLY do not wanna restart it's due Wednesday and I have my studio class tomorrow so I emailed my professor who I am intimidated by
send me good vibes please. I came up w a possible back up idea (if they're enough years apart) but wowee I would rather write abt politics than Jesus/the Bible bc being raised Jewish I'm constantly perplexed and bored in art history by biblical scenes I have no context for and angels and saints and whatnot. thank you meru!! Ghhhhhh gotta go to class..so nauseous..tfw not sure if stomach bug still or not enough sleep. I sliced my finger today but luckily it only cut through the first layer of skin so it didn't bleed  stings tho sergurtg. @ crabbng  You rang?  pic.twitter.com/CokWzXcdHK.

Outspoken Critic of Nonsense, Salty Sally. based on the letters I'm worried it's a bunch of tiny little islands. (softly) ab is cursed this year i'm so scared. I'll be honest y'all there were some really awkward and really cute photos from that year so I tried to pick a nice mid-ground . Update: it's now last year's map

....EVEN IF ITS A SHIT SHOW IM EXCITED TO SEE ALL MY FRIENDS TOO rsgihdfg Just..a lot of unnecessary frustrations for everyone this year. congrats sunny! u vu pretty bby. Gonna try to make most of the artist choices tonight then sleep on it and assign types of love based on responses + ideas tomorrow . crying internally while cutting friends and fandom faves but making good progress on the apps /lays down. !! I'm so glad they arrived safely!!   Thank you for your support!! hey if you're reading this and you're the cute girl from my mom's accountant's office then lemme know what anime you like and I'll send smth along :3 c. THIS IS A LONG SHOT but LMFAOO. I REALIZE THAT BUT REALLY IM JUST TRYNA THROW MERCH AT HER orz. My mom got into a conversation w her about me/my art/conventions and she's into anime is all. I hope anime boston goes well for you   I'll be by for sure! There's a guy trying to fit a dozen balloons - several of them oversized - into his car. "Look in my bunny. It's in my owl." - Shit I actually say bc all of my wallets and pocketbooks are shaped like animals. the missionaries.. We introduced ourselves, then later they asked me if I knew someone named Lina and then at the end of the conversation were like, "Your name was.. Lina right?" ..and my mom said today they called me Jenna LOL Close guys, close.......also still Jewish-ish, sorry. a walking fashion disaster. I felt really gross earlier but I felt way better after the drive home (? reverse car sickness LOL) and anyway tonights shaping up to b pretty chill. Got another armful of preorders out today! Still lagging on a handful but I'll get some more out tomorrow. I made a category on here that says painty / lineless but I keep thinking it says panty liners. zine organizing at it's finest. trying to judge the 'manly' category is hardest i am inadequate. replacing my broken iphone has been such a Process. Had to back it up but not enough room on anyones computer, no room on icloud, upgrade icloud, back up, switch sim card, icloud back up not found, have to update ios on old phone, ....... THIS IS SO PAINFUL i wanan finish it tonight tho /sob. What do I think? I think I NEED ONE. good news y'all: my intense desire to be Done With This is winning out over my indecisiveness and decision making anxiety. (inhales) 6 more......... fates have been decided.......now to assign love types then EMAIL THEN RELAX...and by relax i mean writers app.. This is EXACTLY the shit I'm here for. I jjust sent out artist acceptances and i feel like i'm having a heart attack WOW THAT WAS HARD AND ALSO IM EXCITED and ow my chest. Welcome to Hell. This has happened to me two or three times, which is a lot considering how few orders I do on Etsy. One person wrote me a gushing love letter then the next day was like cancel it I feel nothing for u, begone. My school pleading for donations saying our food pantry has modest budget

Or instead of these weekly emails you could charge people less money to go to school so they can afford to eat.
Or you can allocate more of your budget there instead of moving whole buildings over 1 lot. Etsy is a scary place full of Normies. RIGHT like do you go to stores and buy smth then return it a few hours later?! AND THIS IS EVEN MORE ACCESSIBLE LIKE UR NOT STANDING SOMEWHERE HAHVING TO DECIDE DJFNTHSND. Y’all please make sure you look for other zines on the same topic before going ahead w your own! You’ll hurt everyone if you don’t   I’m not saying you can’t do whatever that topic is ever, I’m just saying space yourselves out bc otherwise people will have to choose between you. (Not particularly Kiri Zine related - Saw 2 for a particular pairing and another similar to those 2).

me: same. Also I love this fam . I showed my mom and she laughed and said I have a baby face and with bangs I look fifteen again . Aaa I’m glad it arrived safely!!  Thank you for your support u vu. /vibrates 
Plush when
I think I’ll email them for at eta cause I’m impatient and should prob update the poor people who preordered on day 1 . 1. Who the fuck does this?! Why are people like this?! You come into my house—
2. classy twt handle..
3. They’re so fucking wrong it’s unbelievable? I really enjoy your art..it’s so expressive and I love how your lines are kinda of..staccato?they seem so sure?Yknow? I’m bad@words. Got mine a while ago but they were /good but not great/ but I knew I was signing up for smth experiment. They don’t have hairs or anything tho   yikes. They also don’t sell great u nu. Yes, Maka!! THanNK YOU . I already tweeted abt this but on writers apps when I’ve already read a fic I am so happy 
I’ll try not to take forever y’all. Me: I should eat less dessert and muffins for a bit so I can feel confident in my bodysuit cosplays at AB 
Mom: I bought u 2 muffins 2 cookies
Me: sounds right. SNORT everyone has such like default expressions and then kiri just looks like he’s going “...Errr...?”   someone help him https:// twitter.com/aitaikuji/stat us/977555367151378432   …. I’ll never understand why sometimes characters get their eye colors changed between manga and anime adaptation? (Softly) Iida looks way cooler w red eyes tbh. Guys I just realized that I’ll be traveling in and out of Boston/the cities surrounding it almost every day (if not every day) from tomorrow until next Thursday when we leave for Oregon...sounds bad. They all have their pros and cons.. If you need stuff made and shipped for you, then redbubble/society6. No work for you but waaay less profit. If you are gonna have the stuff printed and ship it yourself then Etsy is good, but funimation occasionally has fan art taken down. Tictail charges you a monthly fee to have a shop, and some percent of sales made in their marketplace, I think. Storenvy has no monthly fee, charges 10% for marketplace sales but you can turn that off. The system is a little wonky tho/no built-in messaging.. I remember that!! I like it blue u vu. I'll be honest i was 50/50 on whether you made an oopsie or you were just parodying it as a thing people say bc that's art student/artist alley culture LMFAOO. Both are equally funny tbh . It’s snowing and sunny rn... Someone did this out front of my school :o pretty gutsy! There’s always a security guard at that building pic.twitter.com/6S8kvnA8T5. Most people don't have trouble with it, but some do.. I'm one of them LOL ... It's just frustrating when you see things literally ripped off official art still up, but they take down your drawings..sigh. Alice is always asking me what I think I really appreciate her interest in my mind yknow. Good news y'all   Plush will be sent to me soon - It sounds like tomorrow? . screaming I just watched that show w the genius lil kids + they spelled long words backwards instantly
meanwhile my sorry ass: 2 AM, on twitter, try to write tomorrow but it's underlined bc it's spelled incorrectly so I'm like hm OH 2 MS (There aren't, I typed 3 r's by mistake). Good news, they'll come JUST not in time for Anime Boston
/lays down. Wouldn't be AB without everything arriving the Monday after . lrt retweeting bc dekus' wearing a black shirt and it looks wrong to me. good, now I have another series u can catch up on ........ wink wonk. guys i'm not ready for AB
I don't feel
ready. !!! wow!! brave!! * U*   Good luck! I got ink here. How. pic.twitter.com/vNw24zrHGk. Shitty night time photos..a few rad pocket crops for Anime Boston pic.twitter.com/G2n5iZiV9Y. This is a classic move. Too many things to do no time minor mental breakdown. This news about AAC...fucking sucks? It's one of my favorite cons..local..small..reliable..... Now it's going to be too expensive for a lot of people, combined w the capped attendance means way less people and money for AA, and it's the same weekend as Anime NYC. I also had this problem one sec. pm'd it to you on fb. Gotta love that point of stress where you take a minute to assess your body and realize your jaw is clenched, brow furrowed, shoulders high. Will pm on fb (didn’t wanna stress u at work). Got myself together enough orz date time?? Orz orz ord pic.twitter.com/5Mx58906TZ. Aaaa thank you for the cute photos!!! I’m glad it all arrived safely!! :3 c   more to come .  thank you
I was blessed w my eyeliner going well today . Life is Strange: Farewell Thread! Chloe making disgruntled noises while cleaning..same.  Glad he made it!! Thank you for the support . GOOD LUCK!! Gosh looking at it all in one place, I’m overwhelmed by how gorgeous you work is . Also —I hope I’m not overstepping here — but people are flakey AF...I’d take the first half of the payment before any work (sketch) tbh in case they fall off the face of the earth/take it+run   I’d like to think most people are good but I’ve heard too many horror stories . I felt so sick last night I literally said “hi” to Cady as I ran up to my room   poor bby... All I can say is thank goodness my Wednesday class is cancelled this week   I’d be tempted to skip today since I haven’t missed any but I gotta show her all this stuff before AB. I KNOW NOTHING ABT 3D SCULPTING BUT THIS LOOKS AND SOUNDS IMPRESSIVE . This is the truest shit I’ve ever read.  yesssss. Oh no!! I hope you feel better soon!! .

I'm torn.. Start printing smth new (bc I wont be in here summer/next sem.) or just like..do smth less physical - grab lunch, try to finish up writers apps, maybe finish a drawing or two..chill......? OHHhh This is an interesting one! (Gonna split it up)

I can't find the file w the separations I made for this print.......I don't wanna...do it again.../lays down. thisi is the worst shit i've ever--why is this happening. LRT I'm so sorry y'all had to see this
I..I was hoping this was some (still awful tho) liberal thing but it appears to be actually pro-Trump and I don't
have words
How something I love so much was manipulated for eEVIIL FUCKINGmosfordgrh GUHHh this is the ugliest shit i've seen. nausea coming back. not sure if from the Thing I Saw, scrolling through files too quickly (I found it tho!), or lack of food.....gonna go grab a sammich. I only watched a few eps of this show but this makes me happy https:// twitter.com/klippdass/stat us/978718224618487811   …. OHMYGOODNESS.. omg so much pure Soul x Maka stuff in here?!? . Aaaaa it’s all soooo gooood!! I ADORE the one where soul’s arm is a scythe. So far my prof, one of the guys making food where I got lunch, and multiple train passengers have been sick today...p...ray. Screaming the girl next to me waited til the last minute to get off the train so I panicked and spilled prints and phone onto the floorrrrrr orz. Smart!!! Yeah no I just remember certain projects y’all were tracking people down for weeks and that’s not cool. Wall Might/Trump

.
The only acceptable burning of books /hit. No it doesn’t make you an asshole! You set clear guidelines from the start and follow up! I have people til Monday for kiri zine but I’m following up today w the last two yknow but you can’t chase people for weeks on end. Omg that Kirishima....beautiful boy . Oh good even though it said it’s being sent to where I live, UPS says my AB print order is going to the town I used to live in.
That’s good. Yep. c*tprint..please..why this .. why did you ship to my old address /lays down. like I said it's not AB without 1,000 things going wrong. wheeze I love catprint, they haven't done me wrong before orz Luckily I was able to have it held so I can pick it up in time;; But another hour-long chore I didn't anticipate the day before the con..not smth I needed orz. ...I'll be honest I really wanna see how gorgeous he looks like in the style of all the others .....but part of me wants you to leave him as is LMFAOO. half is pretty good tbh!! <3 I'm hoping to get half of my list done too LOL. phew! abt half way thru writers...orz. @ people who gave me excerpts from fics, all in one nice lil doc: bless u. 9 left.... that makes me, and kiri, very happy pic.twitter.com/wZgeBwxAOb. Just set aside the rest of my orders from this past week + ones ordered w plush since they should be shipping to me soon .. no accidental con mix ups ! Good choice . Such a look tho. . A pile of good boys headed this way   I didn’t know what pic she was sending but this is pretty amazing pic.twitter.com/p6F2heU1vh. Iida? I can’t tell u how much I wanna lay down on this..the material is really soft too. Sometimes I wonder what the guy who cosplayed Drake at all the east coast cons is up to.. (Softly) I totally will. Yes!! They’re on  http:// cambrasine.storenvy.com    :) They haven’t arrived to me yet though so — when’s your friends birthday?! <3 They're packing them to ship to me now and it'll take 3-10 working days to arrive to me, but I'll be away from the 5th-13th so it depends how quickly they arrive if I get them out before or after that;; If that's too late let me know and I'll refund you! Oh nooo! ; n; I think we've all been there... I can't tell you how many friends I've had received charms w  text backwards! Pfthahah Alright then! ; u; I'll make a note to do or include something special <3. me: fuming abt ab map
me: makes map two days before con. (screaming) First big con of the season means I'M NOT READDDYYYY----

That said..   Please come find me at R185 in Anime Boston's artist alley this weekend! 

New charms of new series! New charms of /old/ series!
Rad screen printed prints, tees, and totes! Mystery eggs! pic.twitter.com/GU9EoRT3P3. I took a nap at 6:30??? yet I am tired earlier than I normally am? science pls. Me except every con all the time ever
Why are we like this . It’s two AM the Thursday before Anime Boston and my mom’s tryna convince me she can make me a Maka scythe right now...please rest. I was Involved in the process but my mom p much crafted my accessories for me orz bless her... Tbh you can stop this person’s sentence half-way through!!! He found another way so chill!! I think it was cool how they made him stay true to character and find another way and didn’t take the easy way out just like haha yay he won murder. This twitter moment is so bizarre. But it’s got me thinking...in this house we call the duvet a comforter..is that not typical??  https:// twitter.com/i/moments/9790 78187878625280   ….  See you there! PA If you want Todoroki come early! ...I don’t have enough orz. Seriously how is she even real . Come thru   also pls identify yourself bc I’m Awful@Faces and will prob be running on fumes . Truest statement.  See you soooon~~~. Idea: one of those awful chalkboard shirts but instead it says “hello I’ve had _ hours of sleep” and you fill it in w the relevant number so people know how much to expect from you. Japonaise Bakery?  glad he’s doing well! First of all your art Does Not suck, but I’m sorry you feel that way. And the only way to get better is by keeping drawing but if drawing is making you *that* unhappy right now then don’t force it. maybe you should take a break and focus on or try new hobbies for a bit? ; n; . Yet another thing I didn’t know I needed..bless . There would just be like a little rectangle of chalkboard material between “had” and “hours” so you could write in the number . ghhvgghbbbSO NERVOUS FOR AB@MY BODY WHY DO U DO THIS EVERY YEAR
I think anxiety is up bc it’s the first big con since November but also it’s just been so cursed this far I’m worried . @ people who voted less than $30: no . WIP  yes I’m aware the con is TOMORROW pic.twitter.com/uEgQkdyU7P. I think they just don’t get it  Like they don’t realize the time that goes in/haven’t commissioned anyone or anyone w your level of skill before. Personally I wouldn’t be shocked to see $60-$80 w/o the bg but I guess it depends if you need the $ more or care abt what you’re drawing more and want to be choosy (more accessible price point = more people = more options). /pats u We’ll be ok but Shdndj Djdjdn feels bad . Not sure whether to attach the piece that goes over the hand to the glove or to the arm thing.....also I have no yellow paint (scream). SHIT ITS GONNA RAIN IN A FEW HOURS WHY. This color is so pretty pic.twitter.com/4rxQhp2SHT.  bless u
And I’ll give you your prints :3 c. Just took her on a walk but she still feels neglected.. A little attention seeker  pic.twitter.com/dGJHy0FjSO. Yeah!! Don’t undercut yourself! Like Ria said there are people willing to pay what you deserve. Gonna look like an asshole walking in w preassembled grid cube. These ones are SO HARD TO GET APART fight me. This line is so long I’m not even in the fucking hallway pic.twitter.com/LKpUJ4VT7R. It’s lit pic.twitter.com/bvMCns6iBa. I’ve never had to line up outside the room let alone so far down the hall I’m not even In it . Cursed. I wouldn’t be as rage-y as I am abt this if it weren’t the 6,000,000th thing to go wrong this year. Hey y’all pro tip if you don’t wanna be shuffling all your shit forward slowly in line then go in the Sheraton entrance then line up. I’m. I wanna say I’m surprised but I’ve lost the ability this year. I’m almost *in the room*. AB decor sneak peeks on my insta story :3 pic.twitter.com/ZGgKfq2oxi. My life very soon . Missing some stuff but   ...I had no yellow paint for the hand guard and lil bleep blops pic.twitter.com/XkaWgqqBqH. WHAT NO WHAT THEY LOCKED MY AMIAMI ACCOUNT?? I PAID THEM WHATS HAPEPNING. Today off to a great start. If I’m not at my table at 10 AM sharp here’s my complain-y rant explanation pic.twitter.com/JLyLI1Ed0I. Oh good the toilets leaking...ab is cursed; confirmed. Ok y’all I’m gonna be late. One word explanation: Sewage. Fuuuuuuck ID is in jacket from last night I’m . If they don’t give me my prints I... Had no id, nothing w my old address, and my moms last name is different from mine but I was p much crying and she eventually relented and just have them to me.  Thank you for the support!! I’m glad they arrived safely! Someone said Bakugou was really close to being a villain and I HOPE THEYRE READY FOR SEASON THREE AND TO FIGHT ME. Tell this to gourd guy, who sold out by 7 pm Friday AB 2015. My Anime Boston neighbor (in my second artist alley ever) who gave me a complex when he sold all 40ish of his $20-40 drinking gourds by 7pm on Friday. LMFAOO asking directions from a random lobby desk guy, people tap on doors and he yells at them that it’s not locked but they were friends trying to say hi to me . Me: puts all my makeup in one bag so I don’t have to worry
Concealer: bitch u thought. At least there’s a Sephora in the pru . If you want this boy you best get here soon! R185 ! #animeboston pic.twitter.com/5RdCadibia.

LMFAOO YES PLZ I should just commission u for one at this point . I put them in a lil bag w your name on it u vu so just remind me cause I’m bad w faces orz. Last few Matsuris for AB!!! Come quick if u want pic.twitter.com/lWxaSwu5pO. ITS FREAKIN CRAZY TODAY WTH IS HAPPENIN. Hi I like the big 3 pic.twitter.com/OxXjSdeWvF. That I’m used to but my last AB Easter Sunday was sooo slow so this was a surprise! I do so much talking at AB I don’t wanna speak to anyone for the whole next day   Just, like, the physical act of speaking. This weekend was amazing but uh where was all my big three at?! Anime NYC was full of cosplayers and merch for them! Post AB pic.twitter.com/1bX1AYCqlG. PLEASE   I would throw $ at you for them!! Right?! :( I was so sure they wouldn’t be forgotten since they appeared again recently in the manga. RIGHT? I saw one tamaki and one nejire cosplayer all weekend :( and NO MERch. Oh no!!! That’s sad but it makes me a feel a lil better that I didn’t miss out on big 3 pics since I didn’t end up wearing Nejire :(. Me after Anime Boston, a self portrait pic.twitter.com/fnqj0QsFfk. Confirmed: 0 Mirio’s at AB. I only lurk but bnha reddit is wild and the schedule for hell week is amazing. GENTLE (finally reading this week!!!) pic.twitter.com/1b2SOI0DL5. Ohh I hope we get a color illustration soon so people can cos the dance outfits!!! I went to bed at 8:30 and said I’d be up from 1-6 and here it is, 1 and I’m awake. Why is my body like this. Cosplay TOO GOOD. ?!?! WHA— id like to file a complaint: i live here and I’ve never seen a squirrel like this. ok it’s been 12 hours? Welcome to Post-Con Depression......I HAVE MORE CONS BUT..AB is AB . I call this a self-fulfilled prophecy https:// twitter.com/cambrasine/sta tus/980675734279720961   …. WHEN I WAS MAKA A LOT OF PEOPLE ASKED IF I HAD A SOUL OR CRONA W ME AND I DIDNT...FELT BAD . Hello yes I’m going to need to see this . Knowing I inadvertently ostracized myself from a lot of fellow Kiri-loving artists whose work I follow+admire by not accepting them to the zine really fucks me up...  Never had this happen w a zine before..I think ev1 who loves this boy loves him A LOT..233 apps,<30 spots . I can think of five off the top of my head /lays down. Also I’m too ashamed to update the zine twitter but WRITERS ACCEPTANCES WILL GO OUT TOMORROW I was like 80% done when AB hit me like a fucking wrecking ball..if you’ve lived artist alley life at a big con w 12 hours days u kno how it is. By tomorrow I mean today holy shit I gotta sleep. LAST TWEET(s) ABT THIS cause it’s 6 AM and I’m full of regret but like. ITS WORSE BC some people are already friends of mine so I’m like SORRY I STILL LOVE YOU but others I hadn’t had the chance to connect with yet and now I feel like I never will.. I tried to be really particular abt including a variety of styles and not letting my style prefs/fandom biases influence me and my friend still called me out LOL   Having her - someone not in the fandom at all - judging w me really helped or I would’ve never decided..so thank u. Not fucking tagging u tho bc I’m not gonna throw u under the bus UNLIKE U DID TO ME THIS WEEKEND. /IN PERSON/. Fuck no. Omg I know this feel - I ran a zine w Angie and Tori in it   B but yeah Angie got a proper job there and that’s pretty amazing - that’s the dream isn’t it? Haha.  Well I’ve seen some people who are Like That (no thanks), but I think this time everyone is just v emotionally invested in The Boy. No one was being mean or anything (not that I saw at least? Oh god LOL) I just felt bad knowing people got upset but ..I know logically it’s not my fault that I couldn’t accept everyone..I think I’ve gotten numb to rejection (to an extent) but a lot of people haven’t. YESSS   I have not seen ANY merch got this series and this is super cute. Omg no that’s what I’m saying is so far I haven’t seen anything mean to me and everyone who contacted me after was nice I just am feeling guilty bc the decision made several people cry /lays down. MY 6 AM MUSINGS GOT MORE ATTENTION THAN ANTICIPATED! No worries friends, no one is giving me trouble (thus far) I just know the decision upset several people I follow and love so I’M feeling guilty even tho I know I can’t do that   THANK YOU FOR THE SUPPORT THO . Mm I’m a bit worried already since BNHA zines are SO over saturated rn but there were none ever for Kiri so I HAD TO and hopefully it’s different enough to be successful. So we’ll see! I can’t believe I have screen printing tomorrow. My body is broken and energy supply depleted from this weekend and I’m usually sore after class as it is...no thank u. YES!! And even cons where I’m like oh I’ll make a vacation out of it IM TOO TIRED TO DO ANYTHING HALF THE TIME and the nearby food selections will be chains and I just—. LRT I REMEMBER SEEING THIS BEFORE READING AND I WAS LIKE WHAT THE HELL. Guys I just got up but I was in bed for....16 hours. I still feel so exhausted in my chest fjdjdnfnd. lmfaooo just talked for the first time since last night and my voice is so raw I sound sick. Nice @unagicakee pic.twitter.com/n6uk8MlFqB. Plans for today in no particular order: miraculous episode w l..uka(?), gakuen babysitters finale, zine emails, packages, go outside??? Just like stand out there?? Time is so distorted this week has been wild. I was just about to warm up a deli sandwich I had leftover then realized it was a FULL WEEK OLD. This Facebook notif tho pic.twitter.com/YvYdEi8ZAn. *CAPTAIN HARDROCK SPOILERS*
Adrien's dad bein a dick
my mom, to the tune of the theme song: "I will sneak out. I am a cat~". finished captain hardrock. So y'all got a new ot3 or what :3 c. Rui you're giving me conflicted feels............please keep on living to see more good kiribaku content. I have seen luka x marinette art and luka x adrien art so i'm just out here waiting for that ot3 content. I wonder if it's in print in English.. I'm really bad at reading manga bc my eyes hurt reading it online for too long sidgnfdhg. I'm saying i'm waiting for it but i could just draw it myself...but I probably wont LMFAOO  IM LAZY!!! Logically I know we’re too tired to get much done today but my mom just discovered men’s rompers and she’s shown me like a dozen already.. OHMYGOD FJDNDJDS. Has anyone drawn Kirishima in a romper yet and if so please direct me to where I can see it. No way! It’s just a nice gesture :) I’ve done it before. :) pic.twitter.com/YssERzmKJ5. Oh good someone graffiti’d a swastika at my school. Lovely. @ metswee  pssst I know a lot of people don't see twitter DM requests so I thought I'd try nudging you here (From Kiri zine). ohmygod...... look, she has a lot of extra neck skin, alright?! I have done this so many times tbh.. mmmm i'm gonna buy a better maka skirt, this one is stupid. i didn't get a proper pic as Maka ; n;. preorders? (still fairly expensive tho............). ohhh online sales can be hard sometimes but that's not so many!! Obviously don't do anything financially risky for yourself tho! You could always make a preorder period and refund people if you don't get enough? OH I think they shipped the plush a few days ago but I didnt' fucking see cause it was in a diff spot. OHHH THE PLUSH DID SHIP. SATURDAY!!! SO ITS ALREADY A FEW DAYS AGO...oh god please arrive by Thursday...please.. NO PROBLEM!!   Tryna make dreams/kiribaku merch come tru LMFAOO. If they arrive Friday [or later] I'll be so disappointed. ready to bury myself in a pile of good good boys. Mix and match for diff pairings would be fun too but you'd have to think carefully about who was facing which direction hahaha. You know it ;). update this website is DEFUNCT but it *seems* like it should take 4-6 days ..from saturday so...tomorrow - thursday expected? but I do'nt trUST ANY SHIPPING COMPANIES so maybe not. this request stands https:// twitter.com/cambrasine/sta tus/980879380921704448   …. haha Thank you?? I just need to know if it exists bc his fashion sense is Awful and I could totally see that.. imo some """romphims""" are very good and some are very bad... so I'm imagining a bad one LMFAOO. yeah but ifeel yucky. AHAHA H OH YM god You know how your phone's photos will be like 'hey look i recognize this as A Person' so my phone put together a montage that is photos of me but ME WITH BANGS ONLY (multiple wigs). "good!!!a lot good" - actual note of mine from writers applications
Please don't think you're a bad writer if you don't get in, I don't even go here. Gotta come up w some good original content for ota and flame.............. friend helping me judge: Which one is Katsuki
me: I picked the wrong friend for this. /pats u
Don't beat yourself up too much;; At least you didn't do it...three times /sweats. friend: ok so im assuming shitty hair is kiri in this one. who is dumbass?
me: shitty hair is kirishima, dumbass could be anyone but maybe kaminari?
friend: is that brainfry?
(actualy conversation I'm having right now). Her argument was that she's too gay for the girls to have remembered the boys LMFAOO. ok I FINISHED gonna
pee then email LOOL. SENT /lays down
(softly) never again
NO BUT..... I will be sure to read them more actively and judge as we go like I did for artists instead of post-app hell. A solid defense. PSA I'm peacing out for a week and a half on Thursday so orders placed after now will likely be shipped after I return 4/15 - and I'll do my best to get existing orders that I have everything for out before I leave !! <3. TT A TT <3 I still can't get over how much love and support you give me!! <3 <3 <3 (ALSO this is a blessed image bc I was gonna ask you which things I had or hadn't sent you since I lost track HAHA). Honored to be part of such a beautiful board * U*. OH YMGODDDD NOOOO BUT YESSS BUT NOOOOO
I wish I could say definitively that he would Not wear this, but we all know I can't   thank you for this blessed/cursed image . ps my mom (who was enjoying awful rompers earlier today) got a kick out of this. YOOO THe AB DATES FOR THE FUTURE ARE ALL??? SO LATE??? 2022 is right before /my birthday/ (last few days of May). hello yes please pre-accept me to anime boston 2022 bc it's my birthday. i'm gonna be like 40 then (26????????). aaa yesss thank you!!
we should both draw him in better but also bad rompers in the future hahaha. I just found some cryptic sticky notes from last zenkaikon with names/numbers/emails and I'm WORRIED....what do these mean................. oh good messages couldn't handle the fact that my bf's mom texted the two of us this weekend and decided to send all my texts to him today to her number instead, including the one just now at 4 AM. I’m still tired/out of it . I just turned the shower on w my head under the spray already HDNFJDJDJ. I’m a well put together person who definitely won’t be six minutes late to a six hour class without having eaten pic.twitter.com/AMTNPBydsO. They have til 2022 somewhere..faq maybe? It’s Easter weekend the next three years then Memorial Day weekend in 2022. Is it possible someone grabbed the Hynes for easter 2022 already,??? Conventions and critiques always remind me wow I’m bad at making eye contact and I need to. Be better at it. It’s not conscious just like I’ll be several sentences in and realize I’m looking down ?! ??!? My rabbit was nipping me the other day meanwhile some rando comes over and he let her pick him up without fussing?!? . I'll like talking mid-sentence and the back of my brain is going 'hey those eyes of yours, they're looking down. look at the person. look them in the eye. it's weird you don't do that, they're gonna think it's weird' and it's distracting > n<. That's interesting! I know some people who are like that but mine isn't a conscious decision or thought it just?? happens? and when I'm not in a situation I don't think I have a strong feeling that means I shouldn't be I just..don't? I'm bad@words LOL. PLUSH BOYS ARE IN NEW YOOORKKK i'm yellin
I bet they'll arrive right after I leave on Thursday seRGSRJThgfg. dfsdhdf hThe kids at my school...in general they're totally inept at Photoshop? Even tho freshman year has a mandatory course that's supposed to teach it? I had to teach a classmate today to check auto select if they want to switch layers automatically. And then I was teaching her to merge layers but said control E before correcting myself to command E and someone else butted in that she should just right click and find it in the long ass menu. IT IS CALLED A SHORTCUT, DAMNIT!! Anyways out of nine classes I’m considering for next semester I intended to rate them 1-9 but instead I rated them two 1’s, two 2’s, two 3’s, a 9, a “meh,” and a “guuuhhhhh”. LMFAOO MAY ... THE FUCK AM I LOOKING AT. Casually cries days ahead due to flight anxiety. They didn’t put a building number on my address for the plush /lay down why. Just had to call in. I asked how long he thought they’d be and he totally made up his answer, but probably a couple days from NY aka right after I leave so everyone and I will have to wait til I get back orz. The train sucks and is never at a good time for meeeeee I’d have to leave at 1:30 to get to my 4:00 class .  thank you for being so patient!! I’m so excited to get these lil guys out! It’s been a process . My professor said “in particular” no less than forty five times during class today. I counted. Here for this crab content, but I think it's applicable to humans too..I've definitely experienced this, at least. LRT HOLY SHIT IVE NEVER SEEN THIS BEFORE.. THIS POOR CHILD. This shipping company is so bizarre. It's missing so much information? I thought maybe they'd pass the package off to another company but they didn't and it just says "in transit", no idea what the next stop is or when to expect it so guess i'll find out LMFAOO. Today I couldn’t find my notebook for my lecture class so I brought unbound printer paper to take notes on. Then I dump out my pencil bag and I’ve got two paintbrushes, two aqua brushes, two sharpie paint pens, and my tablet pen, so I have to ask a classmate for a writing utensil pic.twitter.com/yf4yHQkciK. Post-AB pre-flight Jennie is not good at being a human. I LOVE EVERY PART OF THIS. You made the right choice. He is a good boy through and through!!!! THIS SHIPPING COMPANY KEEPS GETTING WEIRD BUT HOLY FUCK ITS SO CLOSE BUT IM LEAVING IN TWO HOURS PLEASE......... pic.twitter.com/Ep1ysT3YU6. me: tryna get packages out real quick

I wanna go somewhere!!”. YEAH I WOULD SAY SO BUDDY pic.twitter.com/Y3r6VrFt4P. I liked it too??? I thought the timing was good for several cuts as well......... I TRUST YOU MORE THAN MYSELF THO so I'm glad you think so hahaha. ;//u//; I like hearing your opinion tho!! My favorite part is the "I keep my ideals" when All Might's eyes light up * U*. Every cute himiko for you pic.twitter.com/O2byHJWMj1. Sometimes when I go on a vacation I don't look at the news every five seconds and then I'll go on at night and be like WOW GUESS EVERYTHING WAS BAD AGAIN TODAY. I’m trashed is delayed jet lag a thing. fma has been really popular again lately!! I keep seeing about it all of a sudden. Stupid skin..I always get stressed before vacation so I have more acne when tryna take pretty vaycay photos. Aaa I have some of these gals :3 c. Oregon Trip Photo Thread! pic.twitter.com/JEJaOT9GFb.

Also I’m very mad at myself for forgetting to bring @unagicakee ‘s Polaroid keychain, but I still had to make a LiS ref at the Yaquina Head Lighthouse in Oregon today.. pic.twitter.com/xjq8ogGm06. aaa it's hard to remember the names.. (I'm a FAKE FAN LOOLL)  I have Glory and ...F..firefly? I had others like Cotton Candy (can't tell w the filter if that's her or not), Gusty..Lickety-Split...Looking these up makes me wanna collect again AAaa. (softly) I may have taken a small piece of driftwood........ But yes, these are all just laying around!! I've never been to a beach with stones like this so it was very cool! :O. same!! The whole beach was like this!! It was wild.. I wanna go somewhere with colored sand someday too!! this airbnb has a map on the wall where you can put a pin in where you're visiting from but it's....A MAP OF ONLY THE UNITED STATEs.....orz. I spent more on a screen print for my professor than on myself thus far in the trip...I love her and she loves owls and it was a gorgeous screen print what was I supposed to do . ANSJDDKDNN IM FROM THE US BUT people from elsewhere have stuck sticky notes up on the wall . Woke up the latest so far on this vacation since my bro had class today. Proof I cannot survive unsupervised. Waiting for that sweet sweet student M*CE app...I thought I was being noble by not applying but so many students who don’t make comics got it last year so IM THROWIN MY HAT IN THE RING. Good morning,, beautiful pic.twitter.com/MqttBS86ap. Real talk I got up, walked back in the room to get dressed and he was exactly like this. You can buy his clone . He is a precious boy. I mean. It’s rad af pic.twitter.com/JOTIWIYyVt. Omg they’d be so confused... what if I bought a world map and transferred the existing pins onto it . Often when you see an artists work in a shop they have marked it up slightly because the store is taking 40-60% of the $$$ so I was curious and looked up the screen print guy and HIS PRINTS WERE CHEAPER THERE THAN ON HIS SITE....... adfjsgrg I hiked for three hours then biked for an hour to an hour and a half and i'm broken. I think bakugou w glasses is just a fandom thing but i like it a lot. I DIDNT KNOW THIS WAS A THING AND THIS FOLLOW UP TWEET IS EVEN WORSE NOOOOOOOOO. N O ONE TOLD ME GALLERY NUCLEUS HAD A PORTLAND LOCATIOnnNfuckk. spent all day in the sun
pros: maybe my skin will match my make up again
cons: MY CHEEKS FEEL HOT . (Softly) same 
Inviting her felt like applying to a reach school . OHHHHH
GOOD!!!  I’m glad they arrived safely!! I just read a gallery review where the person was upset that their print was so reasonable ($30) and the original was ~~so expensive~~~ ($700) like that's??? HOW ART WORKS???????????? And if the artist prices their work then why the hell are you shitting on the gallery? ugh. Day 4) 3 hour hike to look out, 1+ hour bike ride  pic.twitter.com/Bf68UJMDau. Day 5) 2 hour hike part 1 pic.twitter.com/GVq4l3HNEn. Day 5) Hike part 2 pic.twitter.com/AqrT5UaQMm. gimme???? (Let me buy  ). Ack!! I never see DMs on here! I’m on vacation so it’s been a bit hectic. Will read + reply tonight . LRT ITS SO CUTE HOW HE FLOPS AT THE END. Moved to a hotel for the last couple days.. pic.twitter.com/LNWaEBdrDV. LRT I KNOW SO MANY SKILLED AND LOVELY FILIPiNO AND FILIPINO-AMERICAN ILLUSTRATORS y'all got this!!!! >:). Hi guys I’m going on a plane again tomorrow morning and if you’re following along at home then you know I’m so fucking scared of flying   Please give me requests to draw on the plane!! pic.twitter.com/rGiiHl9O9s. ; n; just said bye to brother and his gf.. leaving in a few hours.. Won’t see him again til July..not sure when I’ll see her again :(..if I’ll see her again.. Uh oh!   Take care of yourself!! When I get back I have to write an essay and screen print and figure my final project and place orders for my next con and pack orders and clean my room and hgbjnjnbbb. Been running around so much I would like to think “it’ll be nice to be home” BUT ALL MY WORK IS THERE . Guhhhh I’ve felt feverish since last night..heart palpitations ..fucking 4:00 airport shuttle. Shit gets real REAL QUICK   my heart isn’t ready!!! https:// twitter.com/aitaikimochii/ status/985128348476043265   …. Fancy soap made the security thing go off . Enough time to eat and download bnha , I think. Pilot says lots of turbulence and thunderstorms . tfw you're not sure if it's better to be nauseous from not eating or have food in your stomach to potentially throw up .. turbulence approaching sdgifhf. LMFAO HED BE THE WORST BUTLER THO. Anyways there was a really fun time when we hit some tough turbulence and the stewardess was yelling to sit down on the ground and I had like 4000 heart attacks in the time it took me to figure out she just meant that for the people who were standing. Lmfaooo Cady was excited to see us when we got home, then we went to see the rabbit and when I came back she was already back on the couch  not /that/ exciting I guess. (Yells) chisaki and Eri rating: E
my brain exploded 
I’m leaving this fandom . I love these soft boys . Lord help us..based on the tags...that must be..a different one ; m;. I’m craving everything I missed in OR and they’re all a 30 min drive away..I don’t ..wanna. Eh I’m not one to shame so I just scroll by what I’m not into (some things aren’t even disturbing necessarily just weird ideas/crossovers? But everyone’s brain works differently I suppose) but just..that pairing .is.. LRT (not to dismiss the point of the post but whoever he’s into kiri’s face is just really really cute here). The worst is when you’re looking for a pair or character and they’re all BACKGROUND ROLES IN FICS ABOUT OTHER CHARSCTERS LOOL. Our
Pet sitter sent my mom a text saying he won’t watch our pets again and that we’ve been taking advantage of him and that we don’t take care of our pets. 
I 
What the fuck. He changed Cady’s diet while we were gone?? And wants to adopt her??? Jesus Christ. Yeah I’m. Feeling a lot of feelings right now but Cady is sleeping soundly resting cuddled up against my arm so I’m trying to focus on that. Thank you..if anything we spoil her rotten ?? nature hikes almost every day, she doesn’t even have a dog bed bc she’s so used to the couch, yogurt and greenies... she literally complains if it’s 3:00 and we haven’t gone to the woods. In conclusion men are whack if anyone yells at you and talks down to you pls remove them from your life immediately ..esp if they’re supposed to be. Working for you. Yikes. Idk what we’re supposed to do about our pets for all my May conventions now..fuck. Mm :( Thank you for the suggestion!  Thing is - we go to a vet about 30 mins away bc we love them so much. Right?? After he yelled at my mom (again) a few days ago she was done anyway. Kouta! ( New character for you if you're anime-only ;) ). seriously one of the most fond Bakugous I think we've ever seen LMFAOO. When you’re trying to look like you know what you’re doing but it’s hard because you don’t really know what you’re done . I'm going for a tone which I am deeming "professional-positive-aggressive". Includes phrases such as, "would be a great fit,' and, "I look forward to hearing from you.". Yep. And my rabbit. We were paying him anyway but literally the other day he was like 'I'll watch her for free! I miss her!" ....he...clearly wants my dog...please..get your own dog. me, 6.5 hours of sleep: i'm so tired
me, 3 hours of sleep: UP ALL NIGHT TOG ET LUCUKKKYWE'reUPALLnightT. LRT THIS MOMENT WAS P DARN CUTE
ladybug s2 is Good. guhhh class is cancelled tomorrow so I'm gonna go to school then instead..sad to miss the senior illus. exhibit but I am so wiped out...... Will get some orders packed and catch up on correspondence. Reached out to a small group of shops about enamel pin wholesale/consignment   If y'all know any cool shops you think would be a good fit for mine, please hit me up!   I feel like there's not so many rad stores in Boston as in say Providence or Portland (sigh). I've been meaning to do this since I got them... It's been ..a while /hit. THIS FUCKING GUY IS THREATENING TO CALL THE MSPCA ON US..what the actual fuck. He literally emailed the MSPCA about us. My rabbits nails got too long so we've been cutting them a little at a time when he lets us and since we were packing and prepping the house for our replacement pump his cage was dirty but our petsitter offered to clean it? otherwise????????? what the fuck???? Nope. Won't detail his issues here but there have been some red flags.. He's fucking crazy. My mom's trying not to get me upset (too late) but she just said he was like 'If you won't pay me I'll go to court and get a lean against your house" 1. that's not how that works but 2. we never said we wouldn't pay him??? we've paid him every other time? i'm so fucking upset just sitting here pacing and shaking 
really need to get some stuff done...talking to my brother hopefully can settle down after that.. um our house is paid off but he's like 'we'll see how your mortgage company likes this' and he TOOK MY FUCKING RABBIT to his bosses house??? I mean he brought him back but what the fuck. I mean I'm almost positive they can't take my pets away - we've got grooming and vet records, what must be 4,000 photos of cady and I cuddling and hiking, a clean, spacious house they can come check up on anytime they like but like wow this is really fun for my anxiety. anyways now we have to contact the mspca, the police, change our locks.. sorry y'all please mute me if my tweets are stressing you out anywhere near as much as this is stressing me out..  anyways life is a never-ending nightmare of awful people being awful. I can’t believe he took my rabbit out of the house and not even his own cage. They can literally die from stress fuckface !! Omg these are great. Yeah..We told him it was ok if he took my dog for the day but he took them both away for the week?? literally took my rabbit away in a box??? There's a cardboard box that's chewed on three of the flaps.. before this stuff we needed him to come once and walk her one day and he was like "I could take cady for the weekend. I don't mind. I miss her" and now he's like 'you should just let me adopt her rather than the mspca taking her" ,...he cray. "haha this drawing is going well i'll be done with it in like 20 minutes, nice" - me, upwards of two hours ago, before changing everything. glitter in enamel pin designs should be used sparingly / only if it makes sense for what your pin /is/
this has been a psa
slash it's 3 am and I posted an opinion without anyone asking for it. He literally said like 3 times that we can avoid this if we let him adopt our pets...Recently he was gonna adopt a dog but guess he just wants ours now orz I mean, she's a good dog, I get it, but she's mY DOG TDFHOGHfgg /lays down. ok I'm gonna shut up about this for a lil bit but I'll keep you posted on anything important u nu Gonna go to the police station (just in case) and call a locksmith tomorrow.. Also hey I love my brother 
He’s very good   I miss himmm and Sara already. Yeah, definitely! Thank you for the advice   my mom purposely saved the voicemail where he yelled at her sounding p unhinged, spent all night taking screenshots of their texts, figuring out what dates we took Cady for vet visits and baths and stuff /sigh.  Good people are good.. Feel so bad for the runners today..I don’t remember having such shitty weather before ; n;. pic.twitter.com/rqx8S6sEd0. pic.twitter.com/72ahkDhBcs. Aaaa I was nervous since I hadn’t printed in a while but being back in the studio felt so nice and calm   I left bc I finished after not too long but I wanted to stay. Tryna remind myself I got other stuff to do and should take it easy a bit today too. pic.twitter.com/TEvfzhC2rw. pic.twitter.com/C6UnNqQx1e. lrt i wanna join their girl gang. GOOD I SPENT A WHOLE FIVE MINUTES ON THAT. Train is packed today :O. P much tho . Pupdate! Took Cady to the vet - still just dermatitis. Always. They started using new lotion stuff for itch tho so we got that,maybe it’ll help! He said he knows we take good care of our pets and not to worry. Also said coconut oil wasn’t good for her so that guy can suck it. ...that actually looks super helpful :O. Just wanted to let you know that I am available to fight this person :)

SERIOUSLY THO I will never understand what inspires people to send this kind of thing??? what did they gain from it??? Also there was a post a while back about not writing compliments like 'this is the shit' or using other bad words in saying smth positive to an artist bc some people who don't know english/don't know it well could easily misinterpret.kinda unrelated butreminded me of that. Right like do they have a quota and a mental list of people they wanna insult or is it just like a spur of the moment “hey I could be a dick right now” thing . Me: 
I should stop procrastinating on this essay 
(Reads assignment)
Oh this is easier than I thought 
(Still doesn’t do it). tfw you find out the guy who let skilled ladies into his elite illustration school back in the day wasn't as forward-thinking as you would have hoped...... pic.twitter.com/L3f479efzc.  “like thanks??? I guess??” - those women. my classmate and I both had work up on the board for crit today - not even directly next to each other - and someone asked me a q about her print which was an official image from samurai champloo /lays down. Ah well it's screen printing so we're allowed to appropriate images - I'm not sure if she redraw it or not but she drew another illustration she layered it with. The point was two Animes on the board, people can't handle it / recognize style differences orz. Things I don’t know: 
* what I’m doing for my final project
Things I do know: 
* this isn’t due for a week 
* it’s 4 am and they’re coming to (loudly) fix the floor in 4.5 hours pic.twitter.com/885QQyjlmC. I drew this all w my trackpad bc I kept insisting I was gonna stop and go to bed so I wouldn’t go get my tablet. What I’ve learned from this short career meme is that a surprising number of artists I follow dropped out of school then found success. Like I know that happens, but it’s different to see it happened to people in my field, people I know and admire. Which is cool bc I’ve been going 1/2 time so graduating will take forever. Every time someone asks me my graduation year I’m like haha who knows   Realistically I may not finish so I’ve been trying to take classes I care abt over freshman course load. Oh fuck look at that I hit 1,000 followers here!! Thank you   I’ll try to be..more positive..more art /lays down. Also feels good bc while I did attend ~4 years of high school and got my high school degree, I didn’t /graduate/ graduate...I DONT THINK ILL EVER GET THE CAP+GOWN EXPERIENCE. Which is fine you don’t need that but..I’m sure it’s nice. I’m sure a lot of people take it for granted. You did such a good job rendering the poor photo that I almost thought it was real before expanding it . I barely slept but I did have make up so I’m using it to trick people into thinking I’m a functioning human pic.twitter.com/k8zKkLpPE9. Ok last update on this apparently: there was no MSPCA report, and there’s no Jackie there so he literally made all of that up.. so. That’s. Done with I guess???? What wild emotional manipulation ..he caused us so much distress..wow.. This is a beautiful poem. The only words I have to respond to this with are this emoji: . Yeah..me too...Lots of pointless stress tho that’s nothing new in this house . I don’t really know what to do with myself so I’m just gonna like roam around my school for a half hour I never do that. Honestly just wanna ..be done. Not gonna bother. Thank u tho . Anyone got any kind of dreamy music recs? Like..glass animals or trance music or smth on that idea...? That’s a mouthful haha Thank you, I’ll check it out . I feel like I look good today so that’s cool
Makes me wanna go out but no energy (insert shrug emoji). Yeah..the whole thing just kinda hurts.. also I’m low-key worried bc (since he was supposed to house sit) he knows the exact dates we won’t be home. I'll be asking for some feedback on illustrations for my screen printing final (...and another oops) soon~
On the first day of screen II I wrote my goal was to create illustrations specifically for screen printing, but I then pulled my recyclo-bullshit all term anyway so..I fix. my mom said 'your music is pretty' and it's from spirited away heheheh. I told her to guess at first and she said "Your Lie in April?" so she knows me well enough to know that if I'm listening to classical I landed there by anime LMFAOO. I chuckled at this and my mom asked what was funny so I read it to her. she watches bnha with me and said she doesn't think Bakugou would have the patience LMFAOO CALLED OUTT. Option 3! It's interesting, but a little busy. I think removing some of the hearts/music notes would really make it easier to read (See hastily photoshopped gif) pic.twitter.com/ZPlrnNDQfa. hahaha She is~ And Yeah I can kinda see him getting in the zone too so I think either could work :3 c Do whatever most inspires you - it's your story!! <3 
Though I admit I do love the concept of kiri with his dyed hair and sharp teeth as the friendliest tattoo artist.  anytime!! I hope you can get it how you like it u vu I’ve been doing comps for my final the past couple days so I’m in a very “move it around, change the color, change the proportions, chsnge everything” thought process Rn . F A L S E. yeah..you'll be seeing some polls from me soon LMFAO. ok please b gentle bc this is just a comp I drew with my trackpad---
Poll in replies!

General feedback also welcome. Only thing that cannot change is dimensions and the fold in the middle (This is a spread) 
Will be a screen print, so playing w textures, transparency, etc. pic.twitter.com/PFl9r2QUqU. (see OP for illustration comps!). LMFAOO thought the first b was a stutter for a second 
Blushies are always good..was gonna maybe do a few subtle lil flecks of transparent gold too for freckles and on fishy like scales. I already had a p heavy preference on this one, but the comp for the mushroom one is gonna be way harder to decide aaa. Colors are exactly the same except A has a pinkish blush on the orange body (Gradient from the bottom up + cheeks) ;) That could be what's throwing you off. GET READY FOR ***FIVE OPTIONS***
these got weirder the more tired I became tbh
can you tell I watched an adventure time compilation video the other day?

poll in replies!! pic.twitter.com/30NpQAK16U. (Illustrations in OP) Again, open to general feedback too.

Vote below to choose A-D , LIKE THIS POST to choose E. That's what my friend said too! ;). Yeah   There’s always time for things to get worse, but she noted down our name and his and told their legal team in case he calls in.. Now that the anger and fear have dissipated, I’m just left w this heavy heart. We weren’t /close/, but we knew each other for over a year, worked on a lot of things for this house together, etc and were friends.. I know he had some mental illnesses+based on his behavior I’m speculating he may have another but I just hate feeling like anyone could completely snap+flip at any moment..since my cousin did smth similar last year..just SUDDENLY “you’re the worst”, no build up, no holding back. I just don’t understand? Like I’m sure you’ve seen me angry tweet but in general I’m not one to act rashly. Like if my bf does something frustrating sometimes I’ll write my response, wait a few minutes to cool off, and adjust it to make sure I’m not overreacting or being hurtful. It’s wild to me that some people just completely embrace their anger and have no reservations about burning bridges, suddenly lashing out..esp when both the people who did this to me recently were on good terms+never mentioned anything/discussed before their outbursts  guhh/end. Pretty much me w make up, age 21. (Seriously cute tho!!!!  ). Summary of my tweets: WHY ARE PEOPLE LIKE THIS
Hahah  Yeah! Definitely. 
I’m generally good about not letting stuff build up and I’ve been trying to be better about that too, and advocating for myself (in small situations) so!  thank you for the support, Tania . Thank you ; A; I’m feeling less distressed now, just.. SAD LDNFNDNSNdm It’ll get better with time tho, always does . GOOD SHIT RIGHT HERE . IM DRAWING FISH BUT I WANNA BE DRAWING BAKKUGGOGOUDFGSFgd. Omg the guys working on the floor are making hashtag jokes..help. To be fair the fish drawings are going well but pic.twitter.com/657zSHIP1y. I'm so excited to keep seeing Bakugou's development as we go along TT n TT that little shit..I loverhjitdrhfg. IM WORKING AT...150 DPI? (scremas into the sun0gfhgjhn. protip: Use the lasso tool like a brush!! My shapes always look so much more beautiful and smoother with this method than painting/erasing. a relatable tweet. I'm really excited abt these illustrations!! I've been meaning to make more original stuff, get away from fanart/chibis for a minute, plus fully lineless is another experience.I hope the screen prints come out well! Will have to do a lot of mixing/transparency tests + praying LOL. mmm I want this four color press and I’m salty bc I emailed this guy last time he listed it and he didn’t respond and now he posted it again!! Please..I’m trying to ..buy it... Omg.....what did they say . The results are in ! B won, and I think it's stronger too. I'll be making some adjustments to try to keep some more attention on the figure though :) https:// twitter.com/cambrasine/sta tus/986813257947197440   …. Thank you so much!! At first I was like CRAP HER HAIR IS THAT COLOR THEY'RE GONNA INTERSECT then I was like 'wait..' . Aaah!! I get what you're saying!! I was wondering why I felt a bit stuck on A and it's totally that. I'll be using B since I think the overall composition is stronger, but I'll try to make some adjustments and add some more interest to the figure to keep your eye on her a bit~. Thank you so much ; u; That was a helpful comment. OHhh CONGRATS!! \o/ I hope you make lots of sales!

PS Let me know how you like (or don't like) having your shop on wix :O. MAKE WASHI TAPE IS ANNOYING this chick won't get in the middle. Floors are done. I added a before picture so u can see how Wrecked it was. An improvement, yeah? pic.twitter.com/q5EvxZJX57.  very true, thank you . omg..the masked cupcake is really getting to me for some reason LMFAOO. Just imagined this: Camera shows exhausted person flop down on their couch after work 
“phew. I deserve a drink” 
(reaches down to coffee table [out of view], lifts this glass into frame). LRT I don’t think I was that advanced but I remember in seventh grade my teacher sat me down to talk bc I had enjoyed Vonnegut but then got into this really fluffy teen novel series and wasn’t challenging myself and it’s like damn I was a kid let me have fun? That’s how I feel looking back but at the time I was like she’s right..I’m better than this and did my next report on smth more robust but damn 
It’s good to challenge yourself and keep learning but you have the right to enjoy stupid shit too !! One of my favorite things on twitter is seeing someone gently correct someone and it ending with the person replying something like, “oh I didn’t understand. ok. Have a good day”. This just reminded me of my bus ride the other day where there’s an empty row of three seats, this guy gets on and sits in the middle. I couldn’t see his posture but I’m just gonna assume he was manspreading. Gave the crew a little extension so not sure when I’ll have enough previews to post but I belive I should be able to get things up and running on or before next Friday ! https:// twitter.com/kirishima_zine /status/987369344274444289   …. Psst @erijaimeart  I @‘d you in the zine discord . A good summary of my public account. I'll separate mine someday..just kind of dicking around for now. I never posted my AB hula bc I’m the worst but here’s some good good stuff I found while unpacking!  

( Left to right @lanimani  @OKAYKELLYK  @llllucid  @nucheki  ) pic.twitter.com/AncXccCJJ4. Autocorrect haul to hula so I retyped and it changed it again LMFAOO so there ya go. anyway I'm filling orders but a lot of them have at least one pre-order item so I have to skip them. I found one I could fill and got excited til I realized I'm out of pussycats!deku and literally went, "FUCKING DEKU" and was shook at quoting Bakugou LMFAOO. Did you try posting this in the ita bag group on facebook? :3. LMFAOOK IM PMSING SO HARD my mom pointed at me and said “You’re next” and I was on the verge of tearing up and had to tell her spoilers for this season bc she was like uh u ok buddy. I'M NOT READY AND I'LL NEVER BE READY. whheeeezee They don't know what's gonna hit them..it's been so tame so far TT n TT. I wanna see a quiet place but I'm too scared   I've ,. never really watched a horror movie. My pets are..agitated? Cady's fine but when someone's@the door she freaks more now?In the past she'd bark but now her fur stands up,she sounds upset-her pitch is all over the place
And the rabbit bit my mom for the 1st time ever...had him for 5 yrs
wtf did this guy do to them?! Guhhh I wanna be not tweeting abt this anymore but the behavior differences are there. I'm sure they'll relax after a while.. Neither of them like being moved around and they weren't home for a whole week, and bun moved again since we did the floor in him room so :(. The point of hiring a pet sitter/house sitter vs a kennel/boarding is so that they can be at home and comfy.. douche taking them w/o our permission..sdrgjtgifdhg OK DONE NOW;;. yeah ; n; normally it's chill around here so I'm sure it'll wear off.. aaa I'll think about it then!! <3 <3. omg that pineapple undercut is pretty damn rad. Meeting a new pet sitter today   Wish us luck! She seems a lil particular and things are a bit crazy since the guys just did the floor and we had to completely empty two rooms into other rooms . New pet sitter seems very nice :) Cady has been a lil iffy since we got back, esp with workers we had the last couple days but she was immediately all over her so that’s a good sign. the place I usually watch bnha is down right now :(. asFDSGDH THINGS ARE GETTING SO EXCITING AAAA I CANT WAIT FOR NEXT WEEK
BAD THINGS HAPPEN BUT IM SO EXCITED TO SEE IT ANIMATED ANYWAYS ADSFhfdghdh SUFFER AGAIN. The accountant called my mom my grandma's name........even tho he's doing my grandma's /final/ taxes.. Sounds like someone's still recovering from tax day. Bakugou's scrunchy waking up face just added 10 years to my life. THIS TWEET IS MAKING ME A BELIEVER---. Trying to decide if I’m legit enough to start paying out the butt for a domain, hosting my own shop, etc..... 

Thoughts from any artist friends  who have made this change (or decided not to) fairly recently? S..SOMETIMES I STRUGGLE WITH "is this adding details or overworking it?". (Sweating) I wonder if this..applies to me as well........................./hides last three layers HAHA... I think it's harder with screen prints bc I'm like I ONLY HAVE X#OF COLORS I GOTTA MAKE SURE ITS INTERESTING. yeah ; n; I'm also just hyper-focused on it bc it's for my screen final and bc I wanna be Done With It. critique with friends @grimmfirefly pic.twitter.com/buSspHfbod. Done!! I couldn't decide on a sky color though..I've been so indecisive with this illustration..     Poll in replies!  pic.twitter.com/VHvpHcK3xo. What color sky do you like best~? (Illustration in OP). This is beautiful and I want yuki’s tee  ....and also reminded me that I always say I’m gonna draw fruits basket but never do . I just wrote up what must be the most comprehensive overview ever about preorders but there’s no way I won’t get 4,000 asks anyway . LRT (one back tho) that is me I brought my most precious stuffed animal on our Machu Picchu hike. TO BE FAIR I WAS REALLY SICK THAT DAY with what must be the worst stomach bug I have ever had so I needed him for support LMFAO. Plans for the afternoon include getting a frappe and picking up litter. Frappe was just OK. THERE IS SO MUCH TRASH...it was getting dark so I had to get home (no light on my bike) but I’m gonna do it again sometime soon cause I passed even more orz https:// twitter.com/cambrasine/sta tus/988167848387399680   …. :( I’m sorry you’re having a day like that. Be strong!   I find a good night’s sleep is a good reset button, so I hope tomorrow is better for you~. PSA 80% of what I picked up was tiny liquor bottles (nips?), cigarette cartons, and cigarettes.

“This patch of forest next to the street is a good place to throw my cigarette”
Yeah, ten other people thought so too. Almost done!!   FIGHT! haha

Just do your best to take care of yourself when you can during finals!   It’s not easy, but it’s important. Ack! Usually when I have tablet problems it’s the cord, not the pen :o those are almost definitely cheaper so if you’re not sure you can try that! I feel this way about grapes. No prob!   Just be careful when ordering or buy in person bc there’s like..two kinds of micro USBs? Idk, I remember that I got confused LOL. asdf Thank you! It really wasn't much tho since I started like an hour before sunset orz But yeah.. once you do it you'll realize how much litter there is and feel an obligation to do it more often!! I biked a bit further than my usual walk so I can pick up closer trash tomorrow. But yeah!! Even just picking up a piece of litter or two you happen to walk past is better than nothing and definitely better than being the litterer yourself!! u vu. PFF THIS IS ALSO ME every once in a while I stop to empty my jacket pockets bc they get so full of junk and it's just trash LMFAOO tissues, wrappers, plastic bags, etc. shiny hand boy
(I don't watch voltron really, but I like your Shiro TT u TT ). Ohhh just saw a lil red fox!! Pretty . oh. my. god. EVERYONE LIKED THE ORANGE SKY BUT IM PRINTING IT BEIGE AND IM SORRY AND ALSO FIGHT ME
Just for the screen print version I think it's..too loud somehow. 2013. I wanted to make a separate tumblr for my art. didn’t know what to call it. I used a random word generator til I found something that “sounded cool.” 

At this point I’m too afraid to change it and so I’m eternally doomed to mispronunciations of this literal random word. pic.twitter.com/aUkNITXbVl. i meant to tag this #myhandleexplained  but i forgot . yet ANOTHER ACT OF GENIUS LMFAOO. she's subtle .  I’m glad they arrived safely!! Thank you for your support! I can't believe I haven't acquired this yet. Here they are - my spread and cover for my screen print final  
I really like how these turned out!  I've always loved the ocean.. and mermaids..and tangs! Not such surprising content haha
I have a few background color variations I may play with while I print~ Wish me luck! pic.twitter.com/q0XzTWLL5g. aaa Thank you Rosie . aaaa I love having this microfiber cloth...makes me smile a lot u vu. I feel yucky..not sure if stress or inhaled too many chemicals yesterday . Screams
I can’t believe this person was being awful and they couldn’t even do it /right/—-. LRT plot twist guess every anime you’ve ever watched  the characters were /WHITE/ THE WHOLE TIME!!! Not even JAPANESE. Truly amazing. Quick someone put this on his wikia page—. My prof is so nice she offered to let me use not one but two of HER screens to work on my final project   I’m excited to give her the screen print I got her in OR but I’m a lil worried on how to present it to her...like is it frowned upon? Aaa im sure she’ll like it too..her demo prints are always owls and i found a really cool owl screen print so!! I waited til the last class but I just worry if my classmates will think I’m sucking up or since it’s before grades are in or smth.. Haha yes ..probably the anxiety. . I’m not ready for infinity war
I missed dr strange, guardians 2 and most recent Thor. Imma be real honest it’s been a while but I remember watching the first two thors with me brother and both of us just being so not into it?? I heard this one was v different tho and I p much have to so will   thank you for the info!! Wow I didn’t have a sinus headache for like 2 weeks I should be happy I went so long but all I can focus on is this sharp pain in my face. :.....this is very good. CONTENT I DIDNT KNOW I NEEDED TBH. Some things are out of our control. You did your best, and it’s very admirable . Guuhhh I’ve p much felt sick since my bf told me that he relapsed yesterday and stopped seeing his therapist. Coincidence? No. Healthy? Also no. “Iiiiit’s Popplio!” ((Popplio cry sound)). The good kind of migraine where your thinking is impaired so you bring nasal spray with you instead of pain relievers. /lays down I just remembered I helped someone at the studio the other day so now I don’t have enough orz. Gotta do what you gotta do. There’ll be more nice days . THIS BOTHERS ME A LOT but this comic is a blessing. Sometimes I forget academics aren't very good at my school so I get really stressed out abt my writing when I don't have to. My prof was like make sure u read the requirements this time and I was like is that a call out for me who did an artist a few decades past the dates given. on the midterm? then she went on to say that only half of us included images (2 per artist were required), and not everyone cited them in MLA ...it said all this on the assignment..please.. My prof has given me 100's on every assignment so far but also cannot remember my name. She literally hands back every other paper then goes  "... Jennie?" at the end LMFAOO ...please...even process of elimination could work. tom holland is so fucking precious. MY IPHONE TOLD ME I HAVE A NEW MEMORY IT WAS VERY SPOOKY pic.twitter.com/PF8MzpK4U6. A GOOD THING HAPPENED IM EXICFTEDvfdgbfgcn. It's more like a potential thing actually so I'mma shut the hell up for now or I'll curse myself: confirmed. cady: (is hyper)
plumber: haha u feed her too much chocolate?
me: wha?? n..no
plumber: oh my dog always get into the chocolate
my mom: that can kill them
me: like, even a really small amount
plumber: oh really? i dont know haha

?!?!?! ISNT THIS OCMMON KNOWLDEGEDGE IMFyelling. lrt this is fan art but clingy todo koala and jelly kiri is definitely up there on the list of most ridiculous but amazing Horikoshi aus. our new incredibly expensive special pump we had to get keeps stopping working and the guy thinks it was wired wrong at the factory
bc of course it was
/lays down
It backed up gross stuff so many times + we haven't been able to do laundry consistently since September. the good news about this is that the new pump should be practically silent. Meaning it shouldn't contribute to my naturally disrupted sleepy (my bed is above it..) The way it was wired it was LOUDER than the 50 year old pump so that was a fun couple weeks LMFAO. mom: ..then you can get your print order in, unless you have anything to add to it.
me: stop calling me out like this. My boyfriend relapsed and stopped seeing his therapist and I’m supposed to see him next week but I’m worried he won’t even last that long and I’m gonna fucking kill him. We talked for a long time but he’s not clear or sober enough to really understand what I said. He told his mom, said she was about ready to drag him home tomorrow and I am too but I don’t have the same kind of power so I’m about  two seconds from calling her but she is really bad at handling it so I’m at a loss rn but he still has pills so doing nothing isn’t an option. I feel so helpless but i can’t do nothing what if he overdoses what the fuck am I supposed to do. Fuck. We’re gonna call her and hope it doesn’t lead to a huge mess but I told him I couldn’t hang up and do nothing and I don’t care if he’s mad at me, I just worry she’ll get upset then call him and get him more upset and he’ll do more drugs. My mom and I are talking to her on and off now but I feel like she doesn't really get it. his mom is like 'he told me he threw all the pills out' of course he fuckiing didn't!! thats not how addiction works!!! i just wanna watch thor and make art and not worry about whether my boyfriend will be alive by morning. I wish the studio overnight was tonight i'd just go screen print for 8 hours and not think. It's already been years of trying to help him..he finally acknowledged the problem about a year ago but he can't be trusted with himself right now. yeah. I just hope nothing happens in the time it takes them to get organized..  thank you for the support. I don’t like papaya but there’s a really cute papaya swimsuit. Ah I’m sorry to hear you’re experiencing something similar..it’s..not fun. I know it’s not my fault he’s using it’s just he’s been hospitalized as a result before so it stresses me that smth could happen.. I saw ladybug spoilers..NOT THAT IT WASNT OBVIOUS but still damn. Stub hub ? um I definitely don't have time for #mermay  but also did that stop me from drawing this til 3:37 AM on April 27th? of course not

Inspired by the   emoji (thank u @mistysmistakes  )

Feel free to drop a mer req/emoji insp on my insta post:
 https://www. instagram.com/p/BiBKweFlkjU/ ?taken-by=cambrasine   … pic.twitter.com/KXENARJ5bX. yeah u nu. I’m so worried abt him I can’t function
Gonna try to sleep. I called him 7 times I’m gonna have a fucking panic attack in about two minutes. It went to voicemail quickly last time and idk if that’s him sleepily hitting a button or Apple being like bitch u need to stop. I feel like it’s p much 50/50. He better wake up in the morning and go “oh shit”. I don’t know and am definitely not qualified to talk abt north and south korea but ..wow. Gonna go poke around and read a lil. Can’t believe I just saw a poll asking if Trump deserves a peace prize for getting North and South Korea together and it was 76% in favor gonna go claw out my eyes and scream into s pillow b y e. Oh my god. Guys I don’t drink coffee so I guess all hope is lost for me pic.twitter.com/lMrHv1czJJ. Life goes on   BUT DAMN WHAT IS THAT SHOP DOING That def didn’t air anywhere yet, right? It’s so wild to me that some people are sitting there digging thru his tag so they can find negative tweets and respond ??? Please do something else with your life. Yeah this isn’t the first time... it’s More Common Than You Think! Ehh I just blocked him. Tbh it’s not worth the trouble. If that’s how he spends his Fridays that’s on him man . I literally didn’t even tag it I just said (in a much more exasperated and gorey way) Trump isn’t responsible for peace in Korea, like yknow a normal person might. I SWEAR TO GOD I DONT HAVE TIME FOR THIS RN - look sie a Korean person said this and therefore it must be what all Koreans think and also the truth pic.twitter.com/6PpexFlWYQ. Just a PSA that I don’t have time to argue w white guys this morning so if u@me trying to convince me Tru*p is resolving international conflicts and not say, /starting new ones/, then I’m blocking u ttyl. He took more this morning and he doesn’t have class today or this weekend so I don’t see why he wouldnt do even more and his moms at work but I can’t say anything short of you need to go get your son right fucking now at this point. I might. Go over to her house tonight. Ugh I have to go screen print now because it’s fucking F I N A L S. Called his mom to get her to go down there and she had already FaceTimed him while he walked to health services and they took him to the ER, she called his uncle who is closer and is headed down there. So I’m gonna go chill the fuck out and work on my screen final thank god. 6 pm time for the first meal of the day   don’t be like me. I tweeted about this without using any tags and two of his supporters STILL replied to me??? Like are u literally on here searching his name and looking for negative tweets?? Screen printing is going Badly too so that’s fun orz sorry guys not happy fun time over here.  my classmate helped me bless her and after that layer everything went well...but there’s smudges on so many bc of the messed up first layer which wouldn’t dry orz https:// twitter.com/cambrasine/sta tus/990021589008863233   …. THIS IS SO GROSS WTF. I really appreciate my prof but also she likes me so she treats me well...but my classmate who helped me out tonight when I wasn’t well...they don’t get along. And they’ve both been kind to me and I’m worried if I give them both presents at once it’ll be bad LOL. my dumb ass, assuming life wouldn't go upside down, making AM preorder start time so I gotta be up... I screen printed til like 2 AM send help. “A SMALL DISPUTE”
IT LASTED LIKE FOUR THOUSAND CHAPTERS, DEKU pic.twitter.com/zSkjhn10fQ. I can’t handle Mirio holding up Eri so she can see the show they’re so cute I wanna cry. I’m so tired and so sore I was about to fall asleep w my laptop open on my lap I can’t even feel it. If I don’t go print today too (and tomorrow...maybe Monday/Tues morning...) I may not finish 
Also@Boston why are cool things happening this weekend and only this weekend that’s really not convenient for me . A thread full of yikes. I really hope I can make more Mermays on and off but I have to do zine layout stuff too orz. I wanna watch this week’s episode so badly but I got shit to do for the moment . Sometimes I think I’m straight then some days like today I see a girl in short shorts and instinctively say “God” aloud. LRT TWO OF MY FAVORITE THINGS. @unagicakee. Me: 73 degrees?! it’s beautiful!!!
Me after 15 minutes outside: my face is flushed my skin is burning I am perspiring 

There’s an adjustment period . I’m gonna scream they figured out a long term plan for getting him help/out of the bad environment he’s in but his mom just left him unattended again???? Y’all.  similar situation here...we had a couple high 50/60 days but really it hasn’t been that warm and now it’s supposed to be 82 in a few days. I just. Someone shows u a scan of your sons brain and it’s fucked up and then u leave him alone again I can’t even. (Muffled screaming). I feel sick but I’m gonna go have fancy Italian food then screen print bc I don’t have a choice and I really really wanna go to Japan fest tomorrow and see everyone. I just...feel like they should be..more competent. Long term they decided he’s gonna go to a therapy program here and school here, but for the minute they didn’t plan his return so I’m just back to “hoping he’s ok, hoping he doesn’t have or acquire pills” which isn’t my fave. THIS HAPPENED TO ME YESTERDAY with Tr*mp and Korea like these people literally just searching key words and hitting latest looking to fight?? I’m supposed to go down there next week for a con so I’m like are u gonna be there or home or ??? Orz. pic.twitter.com/fxRHJHz81k. You're out here living your best life
IM SO JELLY. lrt omg I was just thinking about that exam today. buff boy u vu. I'm so out of it I can't decide if it's stress or physical work of screen printing /so much/ .. I reclaimed three screens w the pressure washer yesterday.. two SEMESTERS LATER IM STIL SO WEAKKKK. Ok I can’t see infinity war til I see Thor Ragnarok SO IM WATCHING THOR AND THIS MOVIE IS RIDICULOUS ohmygod what am I looking at here. I watched the other Thors w my bro a while ago and felt like they were painful to sit thru but everyone said this one was different and UH YEAH IT WAS HAHA. It’s so bizarre...I very much enjoyed it!! . Do I really have to watch guardians of the galaxy 2 before I see this avengers movie. I WANTED TO SEE VALKYRIE'S COMIC BOOK DESIGN and i'm feeling so betrayed what the hell are those madonna-esque boob shields. sometimes I think I could get into comic books and then I remember I have the long term memory of a goldfish. LRT THE LAST ONE grdihgfj. Ow my stomach is attacking me why this. THESE ARE SO CUTE. Overheard at art school:
“He was trying to say it was a found object but I said to him that’s a piece of broccoli —- and it looks fresh!!”.  still, it wouldn’t exist without everyone’s teamwork!!  WOW! Hahaha my nasal passenge burns that’s probably not good . Help them pic.twitter.com/1D9vGL8aD5. I had to pour the chemical to reclaim my screen cause it was too low to spray so I think it’s that  oops. At people who write just to say the international shipping is too expensive..I know. But I’m not USPS so please complain to them instead . Right?! thing is it’s gonna be a few more pages than a zine I ran before and when I put that one of the scale w a few pieces of paper it was 8 oz - the exact cut off between $14 and $23 and I can’t risk undercharging bc that’s be hundreds/thousands of$ we’d be out for charity... LRT this is the truest thing I’ve ever seen. (Reading about a professor) 
"..many have seen him walking his dog on the common...and have seen her as a model during class"
me: "WHAT?!" LITERALLY THROWS THING IN MY HANDS INTO THE AIR
dog in class?? DOG???? dog in class? RIP Doug . Expecting the print exchange to go like this:
Classmate: oh this ones kinda messed up
Me: (softly) the secret is they’re all messed up. So tired
Need more sleep but no time. Tfw your professor is late but you already incriminated yourself by texting her that you were late. Screams I’ve been running myself ragged and my classmate was sneezing and sniffling next to me today..I’m so scared..... feel better . Ok I just saw the same parent and child walk by me twice on the train and the options are they’re walking in a loop (possible - two floors) or there were twins and they dressed them the same??  But I think the parent was the same too..Idk but feels like I’m crazy . UPDATE WHAT THE FUCK the the parent was different but same kid??? T t t riplets??? Literally walking in circles? Help https:// twitter.com/cambrasine/sta tus/991462196470341632   …. Ok now it’s five times now: confirmed loop https:// twitter.com/cambrasine/sta tus/991462594589478913   …. It was confusing bc without the double-decker you can’t walk past someone the same way twice on a train   They’re still going btw - six now. Jshshshshd even tho I wasn’t happy w my prints my classmates said really kind things about me/my work during crit..I wish I could remember it when I need to but I’m tired so it’ll probably fade quickly. Tfw your charms are set to arrive the day you’re leaving for the con    send good vibes pls. I’m so tired. I’m so tired. I’m sooooooo tired.  I can’t think of anything but how tired I am I’m going to bed and I’m not brushing my teeth and I’m only maybe changing my clothes. Uh there was a two alarm fire so I guess no art history today.. Luckily there are no injuries (pretty impressive considering there’s like five floors)...I just..hope no one’s art was destroyed cause they said sprinklers went off . It’s 84 and my hands are sweating CANNOT ADJUST, TURN BACK. Overheard
“Mom, take a selfie of me!”
Me: pic.twitter.com/pKSRIYtim3. Me: let’s pick up food and picnic!
(sweating, face red)
Me: jk pic.twitter.com/982mMObcIx. LMFAOO I’m worried about these generations..a kid maybe like 9 or 10 said this like it just means photo now   we need to help them. I really need my school to decide abt class cause it’s in two hours and Im out between there and my house don’t know whether to go home or not..could really use the time to prep for zenkai. LMFAOO THIS IS NOT THE ADVICE I NEEDED pic.twitter.com/vN0sDSE8bq. Due to the  , first class was cancelled. So I got to go swimming before heading in! IT WAS ICE COLD BUT I LOVE SWIMMING SO I MADE IT HAPPEN pic.twitter.com/qV7ElfslJh. I ended up sitting next to the cute girl I’ve only seen in passing in the studio all year and she giggled a lot at my jokes and her friend liked my print . Its. Hot. Why did we buy a house without central air. Gee whiz I sure do not feel like driving 7 hours to PA today . If I just had..one more day before zenkai /lays down
This past week was so exhausting w time sensitive things like finals and making sure my bf didn’t die that I totally neglected con/trip prep orz. I’m... so glad my charms came or I would have had like nothing to sell I’m a mess. pic.twitter.com/6404Xyz9it. i think I don't know two of these but at the same time I can't be sure. Free them pic.twitter.com/imRrN7WhOP. It’s a good skill though to be able to assess your work like this and be self aware? Instead of being like I SUCK I AM THE WORST I QUIT or I AM THE BEST NOTHING NEEDS IMPROVING, yknow? It happens. WOAHH!! These designs are so cool/cute . This is the kind of quality content I signed up for. Oh my god?! Is this like an academic textbook ?? Ok so here were our guesses this morning for what time would leave

Mom: early 3:45, late 4:15
Me: early 5:00, late 5:30
Actual Departure: 6:30

A good example of how my mom has 0 sense of time and I am, after 21 years, too optimistic about how slow she is. I think I’ll have to take out a loan :(. Why didn’t you say so before I refinanced my home? . So nauseous...gotta go set up ggjhg. Thank you . I feeling this rn. Well it’s the time I wanted to be there so I’m gonna get out of bed, maybe take some medicine. Ohh did you grow up somewhere colder?? I’m just weak. If you are one of the Elite 60 zenkai VIPs...IM NOT READY. I feel so clammy send help. I’m feeling pretty woozy but please come say hi!! Table 54 !! (It’s last year’s map but I’m in the same spot) pic.twitter.com/Qui8Um5a4Z. (It’s backwards but) I’ll have rad rabbit pocket tees at my table tomorrow!! Was too tired to heat set them for today   In both black and white!! pic.twitter.com/f249buTWGW. I always remember ぁ because it looks like someone about to pop some food in their mouth like "ah!". THATS SO DANG CUTE. Djfndjdn I’ve seen like three or four people getting others’ charms lately and now my Shinsou were missing from this order and she doesn’t believe it and says  “check again” ? :( I now have a container with a few dozen drawers, all labeled..I think I’d know, dude. I only got 4.5 hours of sleep?? How did this happen.. I was in bed for 7 hours tho...thanks obama. My table neighbor is wearing a dress I own and I keep looking over at it / her. PS these are beautiful. I’m having a good day thanks for asking  pic.twitter.com/GTvjhqaijf. I’m a happy gal pic.twitter.com/61b3nzq0Ze. When you have a good April fools joke idea but it’s May 5th. also they *offered* shippy don’t@me.

Tired but still gonna have a nice dinner~~ Today was busy pic.twitter.com/CmQq9dbBbr.  thank you!! It’s in my top two faves . Me: let’s not get the chicken parm it’ll be too much food
Mom: personal pizza sounds good then
Personal Pizza: (is the size of a regular pizza) pic.twitter.com/IXM3StOalV. It was. Delicious. I just have concerns abt refrigeration after we check out tomorrow bc we have a ton of leftovers . Everyone’s been very nice tonight..the OfficeM*x dude charged me for regular paper instead of cardstock and a lower quantity, waitress gave us free salad.. SUSPICIOUS LMFAOOOO. and after many many phone calls between my bf, his mom, my mom, and I - my bf is gonna be on a bus home tonight so thats good...petition to let Jennie relax. I wanted to watch Dr Strange but BNHA AND LADYBUG TODAY?! went all day without seeing bnha til I'm LITERALLY DOWNLOADING THE EP i feel so attacked

Y’all should sign up for Doobert!!  Thank you for coming by!! (And loving Crona, they deserve it ) Hope you had a lovely weekend~. Ha ha very funny. Do it!! I just watched it a few days ago and it was v different from the first Thor movies (which I didn’t really enjoy much). It’s funny and bizarre. I’m gonna watch it out of curiosity too! I’ve heard both ways from people so :o. Irk. I went to bed early and woke up early w enough sleepy (7.5) but I was tired so I took a nap and now I’m groggy and I slept on my neck wrong so my neck/head hurt = n= not impressed. We had some bad weather and Now our screened in porch isn't so screened in...
I didn’t get to sit there once yet this year so I’m feeling p betrayed  pic.twitter.com/l505KlEBLt. The days between running out of sketchbook pages and getting a new book make me feel so lost LOL. Hey y’all what were those really good metallic watercolors everyone was using a bit ago? OH! I think it was!! Thank you!! The   hit it cool pic.twitter.com/NNYghzAtZs. Ohh!! Matching!! . Mom: Jenn!! We don’t have room for five pictures of the same blue flowers!!
Me: Just send them to me and delete them off your phone? Chill..
Mom: No, Jenn, we all have the same cloud!!
Me: You’re trying to scold me but you’re so wrong that it doesn’t work. Arboretum is lovely this time of year..different flowers every few days!!  pic.twitter.com/6NJSyaZklv. I had to google “squishing boobs together” it’s for science I promise—-. Jhshshshs I have fresh/soph end of year crit in six hours but I have Not Gone every year and what’s one more ——- no but I’m scared and don’t understand what it is   it would probably be really helpful to go...but I just...it’s hard since I’m going part time idk what to show. Like I draw a lot yes but idk of showing things I did outside of school or fan art is frowned upon or what and it’s at like 7 am which means leaving here at 6 am which means getting up at ?!;!:$:$:!abbzbdbdkslxld. I feel like it would be constructive though, and I want to be more serious..ugh. LMFAOO LOOK AT THIS YELP REVIEW FOR MY SCHOOL
You came to the wrong place, bud pic.twitter.com/Hxd3Kq3Fd5. rfsrgdh cady is so cuddly!! We only left for three days :O 
Normally we sit Cady >  Me > My Mom but she just walked over me to sit in the middle TT A TT precious. aaa it was so cute watching your adventures together thru insta stories!! TT u TT <3. This is v relatable “does he have a hair dryer and a glue gun?”. Hnn sometimes I feel like I’m not doing life right. I felt that way a lot in high school, and when I first started college since I’m not on-campus..and now again that I’m getting older.. (I can’t belive my 22nd birthday is giving me such a ..1/3-1/4 life crisis?). I’m not a party girl and I’m ok w that but I should still be ..having shenanigans. And hanging out w more people my age. And Doing Things. Idk.. I don't understand .. We have found FIVE ticks on Cadence since we got home????? Are ticks that much worse this year? Did this lady let her go somewhere weird? Check out this @Kickstarter  run by my Zenkai neighbor!! I saw the sample in person and it was super cute TT u TT http:// kck.st/2I9NQmd  . Y I  K E S ... To be fair we hadn't put her tick collar on yet bc we wanted to be able to watch over her when we did it bc she's always a lil off for the first few days.. I feel bad but we have to do smth.. This happened to my friend who didn’t wanna make the skin too dark to print properly since they were for stickers .. tumblr is a nightmare. A good thread. I threw out so much plastic this past weekend I felt so stressed . LRTs a good thread. I hate how much plastic I waste doing AA!! I’ve taken to more aggressively reminding people to recycle gacha capsules, asking people if they want a bag instead of just giving one, etc... but it’s hard. And all my charms come in separate plastic which I hate.. JESUS...yeah...I wonder if I asked if they would Not do that???! ... LRT this is a good idea and I’m kicking myself for missing that stickermule deal now. Yeah I’m gonna ask although I’m a little hesitant to ask this time bc I just had to go back and forth w her about the missing charms orz. I ran out of fancy straps so if you ordered matsuri charms I will be shipping them when those arrive on Thursday!! (muffled screaming). tfw you go on an hour long walk to relax then have a stressful 45 min conversation as a result of not answering your phone....bc you were on a walk..to r...elax..... if you're melancholy like me then boy do I have the song for you
 https://www. youtube.com/watch?v=9sfYpo lGCu8   …. another  https://www. youtube.com/watch?v=p9_Bsj Mi4bM   …. there are two prompts and one i have no idea for so i'm doing the other but it's gonna feel like a rip off of a reading response I did earlir this semester.. For the midterm essay she was like well that's almost what I asked and it was interesting and gave me an A+ so I'm gonna do the same thing or just like rolling up and squishing the prompt into something I feel I can write many pages about. y'all I am losing my mind okay I emptied my ita bag onto my bed when we got home Sunday night, and put all the items in it away. This includes my old sketchbook, my pencil case which has MY TABLET PEN, and my other pouch which has my glasses. These items are now gone forever?? It's been two full days and I still cannot find them I am so confused and frustrated. Update: my mom made me recreate the scene - take my bag, walk in the room and mime unpacking while she sat on my bed and watched and I did not find them but she was looking around and suddenly pointed to them so I guess it worked just not the way it was supposed to. Last year I made a list of goals for the summer so I'm going to do that again. this essay is kicking my ass. It feels bad to glaze over the problematic aspects in some of the works I'm mentioning ...but that's not what the essay prompt was....and I'll get totally off topic...s.s.orry. Did u draw this portrait of me at Zenkiakon last weekend? Oooh! The creamy color has good contrast but now I’m curious for this too . LRT the best part of this is not only did she dump his ass, he now has to clean up the mess he deliberately made to “test” her. I LOVE THIS STORY. I think it’s stupid, thanks for asking pic.twitter.com/gE5QlvI5hL.  #Mermay   pic.twitter.com/vbmYuu21Jp.  #Mermay   pic.twitter.com/tlMlNnFONU. Thank you!! me too u vu. Guys. I saw infinity wars. We were the last ones in the theater bc I had to sit for a while. Why would they make this film. You know who “doesn’t feel so good?” FUCKING ME GIVE ME BACK MY BOY. Also bc I’m not a marvel expert the only thing that consistently bothers me is how no one has problems communicating, breathing, or moving (gravity) on any planet ever. Why. W h y. How are they gonna make money they killed off half their sequels LMFAOOO. Is this a good friend???? Real talk where was Valkyrie ? wait wait wasn’t she on that ship w Thor and the Asgardians ? Aaah he did say smth about half surviving... I hope so . I just. They were fighting the strongest guy in the universe why the fuck didn’t they call captain marvel /first/ . I’m so. Uvendndndnxndxnsjkaka. Dcbnnkhgch I’m certainly not qualified to guess..but yes, also interested in seeing what happens there.. Omg I know I was like uh what kind of technology is this in this universe . oh my god. I'm still not convinced this film happened. All your faves dying? Sounds real fuckin fake. BNHA 182 Spoilers - ish

!! I've never seen unfinished drawings in a chapter like this :O I'm sure Horikoshi isn't happy about it (and some picky readers too..) but I personally find it really interesting to see, esp. in combination with the finished ones * U*. Also Mirio and Eri-chan are so cute TT A TT I can't handle it.. I just wanna wrap them in a blanket and never let them go. The only thing I go on Reddit for LMFAO

story:   https://www. reddit.com/r/BokuNoHeroAc ademia/comments/8iervm/chapter_182_spoilers/   …. YEAH!! RIGHT? I really enjoy it!! * A* It's so interesting to get a peek at his process!! i love this rowdy boy. This applies to every mangaka. Vacations. All of them. There’s sequels for movies of characters who died stop fucking w me Marvel I can’t believe anything u say to me . Guhhhhhh ok so every single night I wake up after 6 hours barely able to breathe thru my nose and with my legs and arms aching and weak. when I was away and slept three nights in an airbnb I still woke up after ~6 hours, but I didn’t have any of those things. So I looked it up and the nose is ?? Bc I have a deviated septum but I’m guessing it’s the dust in this house? I use my air purifier at night but it makes no difference. Arms aching is probably from sleeping w my arm under my pillow (oops) and legs could be poor circulation bc. If not moving during the day - which is sometimes the case but often not - or from lack of oxygen which makes more sense bc as I said I can barely breathe thru my nose when I wake up...in conclusion ? Idk how to fix this at all ?? Pillows too high? Bed too soft? ??????????? Back off bruh. Uses myself as a shield between u and my pillows. Ch 182 was too cute I died. My back is on my marshmallow soft 15 year old bed :|. THIS IS GORGEOUSSS. I JUST WATCHED IT ITS VERY GOOD AND FUNNY pls watch. WHY IS PHOTOSHOP CC SO FREAKING GLITCHY
I had no problems until I updated and now I'm losing it -- I had two files open and it saved over one of them with the information from the other i'm------. Aaaa I also wanna start watching!! 12 year old me was in love with Andy Samberg on SNL . jesus the plush people didn't reply to me for like 4 days and i almost died bc they've always written right away before but FINALLY! NIPPLES. Ehhh an artist I follow was making profit off smth I didn’t agree w so of course someone more qualified called him out and he responded nicely enough I guess but I still feel like he didn’t GET IT - PLUS he pointed out the comment on his story+i wasn’t a huge fan of it.. I thINK THATS PRETTY SHITTY AND NOW IM BUMMED OUT. This is not a typo. This!! LMFAOO FUCKIN TOGA "I FOUND A BOY I LIKE!" AEHFSETIHFDHFGH. AWFJESOGRTG IM NOT READY FOR NEXT WEEK. OR ANY OF THE WEEKS. Hmhmhm Anyone have experience w chillypig ? ; o; I'm considering them for rush ordering bc I'm a fucking idiot----. I think i'm gonna. do some stuff today. the question is /which stuff/.....zine stuff....house stuff........d.eath. I think I may have just decided to fly to Chicago, drive to Atlanta, fly home...............  Supporting local farmers AND local artists ;). I use tubes but then the charms don’t fit in the diameter and you’ve got the same problem . One time I tabled a bubble mailer onto the tube and was like pic.twitter.com/6qhkhRmgNo. Y’all every week we get closer to “It has to be you” and I. Am. So. Excited. I’ve definitely seen official color art of him, I think?? pic.twitter.com/i1MWCbFGsK.  whatever’s about to happen...I’m NOT READY FOR IT. My mom’s birth mom:  so and so is getting married
Mom: ah they’re getting married so young
Birth mom: well she’s twenty 
Me: (Softly) that’s my point. They got engaged before prom what’s the rush y’all. I thought I had seen some but you’re right   petition for horikoshi to draw full body full color Fat!!! After he takes a nice long rest tho. (looking for places to dine tomorrow)
Mom: "Now taking reservations for..Valentine's Day?" .. Did they close?
Me: Maybe they're /that/ popular. guys i've fallen for Thor and I can't get up. he used to be one of my least favorite avengers.. I was such a fool (looks wistfully into the distance). ME TOO.. I think it's bc I...DIDNT LIKE THE FIRST THOR MOVIES...whoops haha..h.a.... . @unagicake where do I find that good good thor content I feel like you know. (slams money on the table) I'll taken ten---. (my mom after looking at flights for at least one hour): looks like we're taking this flight. It's the most expensive one.
me: ??!? WHAT DID U EVEN SPEND ALL THAT TIME DOING IF-----. I had a dream I won some contest and got to sing on stage w FOB except the band was actually panic at the disco and they wouldn’t play any FOB song they were playing weird obscure Disney songs and I was like GUYS REALLY ANY SONG FROM THIS ALBUM OR THIS ONE OR THE HITS. Anyone familiar with car rentals have suggestions? Ours wasn’t so expensive last time, but it was like an extra $270 to drop it off to a different location (we are only driving one way) and every tome we look at another place it gets worse$$$ LMFAO. One of the ones we looked at literally had to either be picked up or dropped off at an airport   So many weird rules ... Yeah it was like $200 for a whole week and now we need one for like 3 days and it’s been quoted like $500-1000?!?  no. Aaa I’ll also be flying  on Thursday!! But to the less exciting Chicago   Dokomi ..one day I’m coming for ur ass. Maybe next year...or the year after when my brother has graduated so we can go together \o/. Also japan when /lays down. err offer to direct them to tutorials or inspiration or smth? You can't be their personal tutor;;. Like...you don't have time to do that (unpaid at least) but also like you said...you can't just......teach someone how to draw... Otherwise majoring in illustration wouldn't consist of a million classes LMFAOO. I'd really love to do a patreon-style ___ of the month club sometime.

I subscribe to a postcard one + it makes me smile every month u vu 
I have seen them for enamel pins too..I think it'd be a good exercise. I wonder if a theme would be good, or just original...BRAINSTORMING.. A BETTER QUESTION
would you be /interested/ in that -- (read OP)
It'd be like $6 - 12 a month within the US depending on the kind of item -- and it's patreon so you technically aren't like locked into the full year or anything. could even be fun to do among friends.....................like switching off months or smth ,.... au where patreon has an advanced search function. The past month has been really messy, and the next two weeks are cons but my June and July are ~ wide open ~ and I'm tryna keep them that way so I can do things I wanna do -- like this, original art, get a personal domain (+ host own shop?), learn more Japanese, hike, swim, etc. fdssfdgfsdg it's so hard to get charms these days, they're always busy now  ; n;. LRT EVERY PART OF THIS IS TOO MUCH. When you don’t even realize your message boils down to “that’s nice but I care more about me” (eyes glaze over). One of those looks familiar . It’s 4 am my head hurts and I ripped a hole in one of my favorite socks. Ohh I haven’t heard of them before, will have to check it out! Oh good MORE swastikas on campus 
What the fuck. Wheeze my dumb ass about the drop the most I’ve ever spent on charms for myself bc I’m ordering too late. Tfw you aren’t sure if u threw up bc intense anxiety or actually sick. I think a friend was looking for rock band bakugou stand but I can't remember who??? If that was you.. I found him? I think the only way I could do enamel pin is switching w a friend bc that’s A BIG INVESTMENT esp if it’s like only 10 people or smth . Threw up this morning
  Slept til 4
  Still cute tho pic.twitter.com/jQrOTNvtDt. True   Thank you for the encouragement.  die with me? I’ve gotta focus on getting thru the end of this month first tbh   ........but I’d love to see if I could sketch some ideas and plan in June/July and establish it by August ?   ....we’ll see . I love this boy. I never watched season 3 but i may just for kuroko... I DIDNT REALLY FALL IN LOVE W TOO MANY OF THEM;;. Will do u vu. How is hurting almost 3,000 people self defense? What the fuck is wrong with them?? Way out of proportion. @ Ninapedia  @grimmfirefly  @unagicakee. THANKS FOR NOTHING, "FRIEND.". pretty sure that motto doesn't applying to SUFFERING. me, obviously doing well: DOESN'T APPLYING. me: maybe i'll feel better if I eat something..
stomach: bitch u thought. YOU'RE WELCOME
ITS PAYBACK. uhh apparently I accidentally tweeted "55 Palestinians" earlier in quotation marks which could come off super wrong so u h I did'nt?? try to tweet that? not 100% sure what happened. TW/bugs 

WHATTHEFUKWHAYDTHWFUCK DID SMTH HATCH OR WHAT pic.twitter.com/5MXkrcx2oG. I HATE WHEN PEOPLE THROW THINGS OUT. I'M SO EXCITED FOR MIIIINE /vibrates
They turned out so well! LRT is actually my life on this dead end street. LMFAOO WE ARE HAVING A POTLUCK AND DID A TERRIBLE JOB COORDINATING FOOD what kind of dinner is this —- pic.twitter.com/i228fOTMRd. I think shows like SPX and MICE in the US would also be good fits, but a lot of travel ... Y’all I’m gonna scream our new pet sitter just cancelled on us. We’re leaving /Thursday/. Why are people so bad??? Stop??? Ok probably found another pet sitter wheeze. JENNY HOW COULD U DO THIS TO ME......MY BEST BOY... ajdndjdjJDJDJ I TOTALLY MISSED YOUR EARLIER POST OF HIS DESIGN I’m glad u included his mask the answer to weird bondage mask is always yes . I can’t wait either   It’s gonna be a while, right? I have ACEN, Momo, Otakon, Flame Con, San Japan ? I got a mosquito bite on my face . I’m so scared of flying   I’m not packed  help. Phew. Landed safely. Let’s just hope my bags made it on or I’ll /really/ have nothing to sell .  I was so convinced I’d at least get to drop off my bags today but we’re still in line for the gaaaaate. Aaaa please do!!!  it moved again this year, so keep an eye out~~ Darn, don’t have the zine yet for you to sign . Airport. Sat for over an hour after landing and now we’re at the baggage claim but there’s 0 bags yet and set up ends in 22 minutes . Definitely!! Sometimes if I forget my book I’ll have someone sign a sticker but it’s not he same   And yes, I definitely have some boys with me . OHHH DARN I WANNA SEEEEE . It opens at 10 tomorrow and I didn’t get my mom a badge in advance bc I didn’t decide to go for sure til like 3 days ago   screwed. LMFAOOO INDECISIVENESS MIxed with unluckiness   hopefully Your con goes smoother!! I can't tell if it's not clear or I'm just that pooped out already but --- ACEN exhibitor/artist alley check in.. Do I go straight to the AA room? or reg? help. Thank you!! That's what it sounded like from the e-mails but I wasn't 100% sure! I'll be taking an uber so I'll just drag my suitcases through the building haha. Don't have the energy to make map but I'll be at ACEN B20 this weekend! Due to a delay w my flight I wasn't able to set up tonight+probably won't be fully ready by 10 AM, so pls be patient with me ; u; also low on a lot but when I run out I'll take preorders w/ no shipping charge. Me in 2015: UP ALL NIGHT MAKING THINGS JUST IN CASE GOTTA BE READY

Me in 2018: flies halfway across the country with barely any of my most popular merch, gets prints at OfficeMax on Friday afternoons. I didn’t know I needed this holy crap . Baby upstairs has been crying for a half hour and it’s not even 8 yet please end me. This morning was a bit rough but I’m set up and settled in at ACEN B20!   Come thru ~. Pssst twitter buddies - I’m low on a lot so if you want smth specific u may wanna ask me to hold . Yes indeed I do   I’ve got a decent amount of him rn but I have a feeling tomorrow will be wild so I can put him aside if ya want~. I’m not doin amazing so far but I bought two things already   I think the problem is I know most of the east coast artists by now but a lot of these folks are new to me!! Crying bc I cant watch bnha til tonight. Slightly defective baby boy can be yours for $15! Ask for him !! #acen  table b20 !! pic.twitter.com/taCI43omJF.  If you’re the person w the super cute Tokyo Mew Mew bag with the strawberry bell around the window pls come back I want a pic and have smth for us #acen  If you see them, tell them!! Uh my mom bought a slice of cake but it’s more like a whole cake so if you can find a plate then you can have some!! Please. pic.twitter.com/io2hP3E65x.  what a pure post. He has found a home! Thank you! I’m yelling I didn’t realize this artist I follow was also this other artist I follow - like it’s her separate brand and earlier I was like “I’ve been following both of you for so long!” And I’m EMBARRASSED. I fucked something up. Badly. gearing up for today's bnha .. usually I go 720 p but this week ---- 1080. IM NOT READY. I hear the guy upstairs saying it's the kid's bedtime. Idk how he's gonna go from running the length of the house - which he was also doing 12 hours ago - to sleeping, but best of luck to them. ITS STIlL DOWNLOADING This is true pain. I was like haha omocat u have no power over me now and went to the booth anyways just to peek and SOMEHOW I HADNT SEEN THE SPRING 2018 .......
I bought something, but not regrets cause the only other light hoodie i have is from PINK when I was like 13 and is fallin apart. sdghshg I'm having fun at the con but in general I'm having trouble enjoying my time away this time.. it was prob just that bad news + lack of sleep at this airbnb that leaves me no energy for extra activities .. Omg they did u dirty. I’m so sleep deprived w these damn kids that I just spent five minutes looking for the pants I’m already wearing. /wipes your tears away.  y’all are too kind!! Last one for real! #acen  table B20! pic.twitter.com/ICLWcnmV1c. He gone!! If you come by tho you can still see a sample in person and preorder with free US shipping!! @unagicakee @grimmfirefly  @Ninapedia. CONGRATULATIONS!! Djfndjdn omg I’m so sorry..probably like being on the concert wall at Anime Boston . NO ?? WALLS?!? Omg that’s...bad. Heheh thanks you too! And yeah, they’re so popular I’m constantly restocking ! . Oh, no I’ll be restocking! I even have some in time for Momocon next weekend. I just mean last one for the convention :). THESE PHOTOS ARW SO CUTEEE. At nearby restaurant, waitress complaining that “these anime girls” gave her crumpled cash   I can relate. Sooooo how many of u fuckers are making fairy nejire charms bc i want in on both making and buying . I had a good time at ACEN. I knew these cons were more like hoping to expanding my audience and have fun rather than making bank since there’s so many costs (flying, lodging + pet care for days in between the two too). since I’m using a different supplier for my Momo rush order, I’m gonna have to put them together myself. For pussycats I’m thinking star shaped split key rings?? Thoughts? I didn’t understand split rings for a long time so I’m bias against them but I’m not sure how people feel pic.twitter.com/1iVuhHh1kM. (See OP). LRT matsuri set keeps getting further from  canon . The baby upstairs is crying..please..I’m so tired...I’m not gonna have kids for a long while. aaa yes, it me!! ; u; Thank you so much for coming by - and for the compliments!!   I hope you had a lovely weekend~. Holy. pic.twitter.com/QjGkazxFwK. Chicago pic.twitter.com/zEp9sN1wgE. Tfw you leave late then lose an hour to time zones . We drove til really late and the lady ignored the do no disturb sign not once but twice...please..it exists ft a reason. > talks to one person in Louisville
> develops southern accent.  Take some time for yourself! See ya when ya get back ~. Wouldn’t be a family trip without one extravagant purchase supporting a local artist   no regrets. Ohh! I am! I’m in Berea headed to TN. Ahh yeah!  I think we passed Lexington already .  This is a cute little town with lots of folk art and craft!! I’m glad we drove thru here!! If anyone’s looking for me at Momo tomorrow just know I may not be ready til Friday!! We had to do some road trip rearranging due to weather so we’re running a bit behind schedule  Goal is to get there before close tomorrow. Hehshdh we had to change the plan to arrive late but I still feel like an ass. . @kohichapps  I didn’t realize you were also at Momocon until a few days ago, and didn’t realize you were ONE TABLE AWAY FROM ME   also@ur table#——- nice. I can’t believe I almost got a decent night’s sleep last night but then the neighbor at the airbnb mowed the lawn. YIKES...I thought the 6 on Cady was bad . I set my first alarm an hour early by mistake I’m —-. You ever look at your spot on a map, say “this spot is gonna be bad,” go anyways and then it is?   Please come visit!!! pic.twitter.com/dZhFpmQcrT. You know I’m busy when I HAVENT READ THE NEWEST BNHA CHAPTER. Aaaaa since the main order wasn’t gonna make it in time I knew it’d be like this but still..running out of like..so many charms..much stress. AA life is so hard..at one con you’ll sell 20 of a design then at the next you’ll sell 2 so you can guess but you’re probably wrong . Pet sitter sent a pic of Cady and I STARTED CRYING SHES SO BEAUTY I MISS A GIRL. Also if you’ve messaged or emailed me in the past like week I am gonna try to reply to most if not all tonight!! I’ve been literally running around so I’ve fallen behind . Bruh what’s ur problemo. YEAH!! Got mostly set up last night thankfully! JUst STRESS BC IM RUNNING LOW ON...EVERYTHING bc back-to-back cons
ILL SAY HI PROPERLY (and throw $@u) tomorrow!! time to...reply to  emails /lays down. HOLY SHIT I FORGOT BNHA AND SAW A SPOILER OF THE BEST THING BUT IM STILL MAD ABT IT. I'm not even done but never has there been a BNHA chapter so pure---. GOOD LUCK THIS WEEKEND!!!  SO MANY CONS ALL OVER. LRT MAY BE THE BEST THING IVE EVER SEEN. OK I BELIEVE I HAVE ANSWERED EVERY MESSAGE/EMAIL even zine ones so if you're still waiting for a reply from me please point me in your direction!! Me: I’ll go back to the airbnb, sleep early so I can be awake tomorrow to cosplay, be present at the con, and then alive enough for the concert
Me: reads bnha, updates my store, replies to every email I’ve received in two weeks, eats again bc I stayed up late enough to b hungry. AAA SOME FRIENDS COINCIDENTALLY BOUGHT THE SAME CHARM OF MINE AS BDAY GIFTS FOR EACH OTHER if that ain’t the cutest shit then?? I don’t remember when or where but I am PRETTY SURE at some point there was a mention that manliness wasn’t about gender ... wish I could remember . YES!! That was it!! Thank you . (Screaming) trading with one of my favorite artists??!?! Unpopular opinion but Exhibitors should get to cut the bathroom line ohmygodndbdhdihavetoepeeeeee. Imma be honest I may be convinced to also watch the English dub there seem to be some ridiculous lines I’m missing out on. Omg someone was gonna commission me to draw Mirio and Eri I hope he comes back :3 c. A mood...IM GONNA COME OVER NEXT CHANCE I GET.. can’t believe I’m tweeting@u one table away . Aaaa thank you!! . Ohhh that’s ok!! I can bother u tomorrow if thats better? It keeps being busy but I want an enamel pin before the weekend is out :3 c. It’s  http:// Cambrasine.storenvy.com    ! By updating I just meant changing most of the charms to preorder   I may change to hosting my own site/shop over summer :3 c. OH SHIT. Yes I’m waaaay the heck back here!!!  pic.twitter.com/ssFt2SjtuL. I didn’t see your table?? I’ll go looking for ya tomorrow!! (Ps I’m bad w faces so pls remind me if I don’t recognize you  ). This is my first time doing at con commissions (even though they’re only doodles) and I feel like there’s two types of people: those who say “thanks” and runs away without even looking at it, and people who go OH MYGOOODDD I LOVE THIS (shows friend) LOOK AT THIS DID U SEE THIS—-. “I dig it!” . OHH! I see! I was admiring jinja’s rainbow shinsous   Omg yeah..I feel like it’s even hotter in our corner of hell LMFAOO. Omg that’s cute but yeah I don’t think I could draw under pressure! I tend to draw once to get familiar w hair, clothing, etc then do it properly.  glad to know it’s a universal experience. LRT I love a boy 
All y’all anime only folks who were like “it’s so obvious he’s gonna become evil” ——-   ARE YOU SUFFICIENTLY SHOOK? I sat in the bbq place for like 15 mins and my hair smells like a fire pit. goin for that 1080 p again !!!!! OMG!!! NOoo!!! Literally my favorite commission I drew the person was 'oh thanks' and the ones i was like 'I BUTCHERED THE CHARACTER' were so happy and excited smiling really big?!! It's no bearing on your art!! Also there's people like me who aren't always super OUTWARD about excitement?? Sometimes I get in my head about 'seeming excited enough' when I I really am genuinely happy, so maybe that's a factor too//. PS This is always gonna be my favorite translation of this scene, please enjoy-- pic.twitter.com/qqVeBtyvvW. THIs PANEL MAKES MY HEART BEAT FAST gosh it's very good. ODODDHMYOOOG I HAD TO WATCH THE ENG DUB OF THIS EP AFTER SEEING THOSE CLIPS AND
BAKUGOU TELLS SHIGARAKI TO "GO THROW YOURSELF INTO TRAFFIC". They butchered Uraraka's line and made it like ' i dk guyssss I think it'd make things worrsee' not like 'he won't accept your help'. ITS AN IMPORTANT LINEEEE /kicks funi. ARE YOU SURE??? sometimes mine malfunctions but i just shake it around and feed it nickels til it functions again. ....UH OH...SO ITS STUCK?????? The only solution is to crack it open with a hammer, then reconstruct it using Elmer’s glue and scotch tape. Yknow, like in cartoons . Ok who’s gonna change into their swimsuit and run thru the water at Centennial Park with me tomorrow?? Yes or yes???? LMFAOOO YOURE WELCOME FOR THE ADVICE!!! (Really though good luck!! I hope you can get it going again!). Yes? A mood. Late but cute. See y’all soon pic.twitter.com/jM7DngQT3u. Update this penny is cursed my mom just backed up into someone ?!? She “didn’t see them?” Even tho I told her and we have a back up camera I’m fucking —- https:// twitter.com/cambrasine/sta tus/1000735546791153664   …. Actual dialogue:
Me: back up before someone comes behind you
Mom: ok
Me: oh there’s someone behind you
Mom: no there’s not
Me: There’s someone BehiND YOU —-
(CRASH). I’m throwing that penny away somewhere in not joking. Our neighbor leaves out yesterday and the new peeps are aggressive marketers (((anxiety intensifies))). Fuck. pic.twitter.com/nhwlUQ4ulh. Bakugou is best boy at this con so now I’m swimming in Todorokis LOOOL. Omg people are sassing back@him. (Commission)
How big is his cape?
(Zooms out)
Holy shit it big.  Thank you for preordering!! (My dumb ass didn’t order stars in time  ). Sometimes I use math to figure things out and then every con is different and my charm drawers get Wrecked  pic.twitter.com/gL4L02eUb3. @the person who stole a charm off my board: thanks for robbig me of that sale, future sales (bc it was on the preorder board), and now I have to message a customer that it was supposed to be sent out to immediately after this weekend. pic.twitter.com/ozil7tXWRC. Hey!!! I had another charm and an enamel pin stolen!! Please stop!! Two more things were stolen!   That’s more than in my entire AA career til now. Nah it was two different fandoms and an original :( took down prints on the side of my booth so I have less of a blind spot but one was right in front of me! Yeah, damn :( It sucks not being able to get everything you want but stealing from artists and small businesses is so not cool. !! No worries! I’m running out of steam too.. I can always use more kohi merch if you want anything from me ;) 
(I sold out of a lot tho so u may wanna ask first ahah). It’s a busy con weekend :( I’ve been really lucky before now busy damn 3 things in one day is a lot!! /paps u thank you Jenny . Ahh damn :( I wonder what’s making people get sticky fingers this weekend? The con has been going well thankfully, I’m more upset morally than $ wise. LMFAO THATS WHAT I WAS THINKING TOO TBH. I should just order 9,000 rescue charms in preparation for the next few weeks . oh my god I know he’s cute but please stop fucking stealing from me??? Is this like one person who has it out for me or what?? That’s the fourth missing thing, second pussycats deku . Ahhaha if I got 9,000 they’d be passed down thru generations . This has never been a problem before this con - I’ve had one thing stolen since I started in 2015 but like damn guess I’m redoing my display . I hope every time they see his cute little keychain face they feel guilty . Just the samples up for display ; n; they are easy to grab but it hasn’t been a problem with this display for years so . Mmm people like to touch things tho, and some are different on each side so!! It’s a good idea for certain items though, thank you!! ANYWAY aside from the theft - Momocon was a really great time! I enjoyed myself even though I didn’t know a ton of people I got to meet folks! ; u; I hope I can come back next year . You don’t have to be popular to have success in artist alley!In fact it’s a good way to get more followers! People are there and looking at EVERYTHING! But yeah if you’re starting it’d be good to share with someone and it does cost $ like any start up with no guarantee of success. If you ever wanna talk more about it I’m here! Yeah, it’s fun to start w a friend / sharing to cut costs! Even now when I need the space of a full table if a con isn’t lucrative I’m still like “if I had split the table my profit would be higher” haha. Prints are always reliable - cheap to produce and you can get them made quickly if you run out so I’d say start w that and build up your inventory of other items like charms as u make $!! But yeah take your time but if u ever wanna talk abt it in the future  I’m here! Just a bit of a disappointment in an otherwise very lovely weekend tho :).  Thank you so much for all your support!! Take good care of my babies!! . I think it’s actually like a weird psychology thing that people are more likely to buy if they can touch?? I display my mew mew charms like that but people are still like OHH ITS THE SAME CHARM   some people try to buy two by accident! Just a couple hours left!! https:// twitter.com/kirishima_zine /status/990254712585900032   …. Right when we finished I said “I wanna go home and draw so many things!!” And I know when I get home I’m Not Gonna. Been doing AA for a few years but sometimes there are still surreal moments of STUFF POPPING UP -like a friend’s friend got my charms as a gift, friends buying the same charm for each other’s b-days, some1 posting what they bought only to have others reply w pics of their own etc. Also I saw someone w @unagicakee ‘s lanyard and another w a charm I love how our art spreads across the country and world in such a way? Anyways sorry for my musings I’m so tired I’m gonna stop thinking and being sentimental now ahhaha. A couple weeks ago I asked my boyfriend what MCU movies he had seen so far and he answered with something along the lines of “uhh the green hornet..Deadpool...” and I don’t understand how we’ve been together six years and this still happened. . :o why is that one part looking glow-y,? Hahah I thought so but my curiosity couldn’t stop me from thinking “what if it’s some super secret screen burning technique”   Thank you for answering ! “It’s the Magic, I put a little into all of my work—” . Good morning?? pic.twitter.com/RLrAqsznmh. Anyway it’s a pretty miserable state of affairs when the emergency alarm goes off and the only two options are FIRE or GUN so u gotta fucking look before u leave and wonder where to go after exiting.  Stay strong!! Yesss crop top life! You’re braver than me tho ! I’m self conscious and always wear high waisted things with them . WOOAHH HOLD UP DO YOU KNOW THE ARTIST OF THAT MIRIO CHARM??? (I drew the big 3 print btw — thank you!! ). UH SO I WENT THRU THE ALLEY LIKE FOUR TIMES AND SOMEHOW MISSED BIG THREE MERCH END ME. Ahh that’s so sweet!   That’s ok! Can I use your photo (with credit) to see if anyone on the internet knows? . Ohmygod that was my row?!? HOW DID I MISS IT? Thank you so much for the info!! I’ll ask the internet and check the artist listing later :) . HELLO BNHA FANDOM AND #MOMOCON  Please help me find this artist!! I need him   I was told they were in my row but the list didn’t help.. pic.twitter.com/kF0y9C3Gwq. Photo cred to @JohnBahamonde1 !! Ohmygod I know grey I even went by I’m ——-  thank you!! That’s funny - that’s exactly what my friend just suggested! I think I’ll try moving it to the part of the grid that’s set back instead of the front and then if it persists try the peg board! I just like moving things around a lot. That’s very kind of you but don’t worry about it! More upset about the concept of stealing from a small biz/artist than about the money. Luckily they were things that I had produced, not hand crafted. . FOUND AND I KNOW THEM IM SSTUPID THANK UOU.  thank you!! Will you be at Otakon? :o. I found a lucky penny today but this one doesn’t seem cursed so far - just got free donuts!!!! (Softly) $800 is more than you’d make at work tho. There are so many Jesus billboards on this roadtrip.. it’s a lot. I can’t believe they oversold AT LEAST SIX SEATS when it’s MEMORIAL DAY . Dumbasses. I feel that. We left the same day but we decided to drive home instead of flying  I’m glad you managed to get on!! Me@this vending machine: u ok buddy? pic.twitter.com/DWnJBErutn. The m&ms fell but I gave them to other weary travelers pic.twitter.com/LlvXjfWQco. (3.5 years into doing artist alley) self care? I don’t know her. But yeah this is a good idea for n00bs, con veterans, and everyone in between! “Some days I feel like this vending machine..” LMFAOO. Ahh me too, this weekend! Just a few things off the table tho, I saw that a couple people had all their cash stolen... I always separate my money every night and only bring in start up each day. My friend and I were discussing what’s safer - on you, hotel/airbnb . Some friends from the Atlanta Botanical Garden pic.twitter.com/Qvu56yTQPl. I get carsick in the back seat, or when it’s raining...motion sickness is weird . LRT I was saddened by the theft at my table but when I read about someone who had all their money stolen I got so emotional I almost started crying just imagining it. Some people rely on this for their livelihood or to supplement their shitty regular jobs!!! Also it’s so much. more work than you think to prepare for these things, plus traveling, plus the exhaustion of working sometimes 12+ hour days (lookin at u, Anime Boston and Otakon) - and yeah it’s fun but it is /working/! Sometimes factors out of your control make you lose money on a con too. (Poor weather, poor organization, poor alley/table  placement, etc.) which can lead not only to poor sales but also to lost money in STOCK you bought and expected to sell but didn’t. Some artists do tons of conventions and still squeeze in time to make new things for y’all to. enjoy. My point is yeah artist alleys are rewarding and fun a lot of the tome, but artists work fucking hard and some depend on these to keep them afloat and if you steal from them then hey you’re pretty shitty. Anyway thanks for coming to my ted talk,. Djkhxhkkgf fuck. Can’t be as bad as my first day of college when a prof doing attendance called out a super white name then went “uh uhh I mean —- Yuki” and a very white girl raised her hand like that was the name she wanted for school and I was like what the hell did I just see. EVERY TIME I WENT BY YOU WERE BUSY AND IM SHY IM SORRY I SHOULDVE SHOVED MY WAY IN . Will you be at Otakon or Flame Con?? Ps your rainbow shinsous looked gorgeous ( I saw after-hours :3 c ). Oh no   maybe we’ll both get into anime nyc again or smth..... YEAH IT WAS BUSY... Spending money feels bad but supporting artists feels good

I think I’ve made this tweet like three times but it’s very accurate. (Muffled screaming). Oh wow!! So they caught the person red handed? That’s pretty rad - that people who intervene. Sorry someone tried to do that to you though :( wonder if it was the same person... *that there were people who intervened. I’m sure whoever came up with heated seats didn’t intend them for period soreness but I still wanna say thanks. Why are y’all even going to the park if you’re speeding by not giving a fuck about three beautiful deer . I just saw so many deer!! The park closed at 7:00 and not dusk like it said so   next time... Lmfao ok the cashier was saying he should’ve had 30 kids so “at least one of them would’ve been successful” and anyway that’s not how that works. My throat is starting to hurt pretty badly..please please don’t be con plague..I’m not home yet..I have things to do... Holy shit. I’m so sorry. Losing a pet is so so difficult. I’m sure you have others you’re close to for support but I’m here if you need to talk! Too bad it’s their job \o/. Anyway I got my period and a cold today why is my body betraying me. Hello I’m sick / tired / on the road pls send me yoi movie info/info  link please thank. Nothing “breaks” as often as ice cream machines at McDonald’s. I know you already cleaned it but my throat hurts please give me ice cream . This is one of my favorite parts . Success   she was really cheap w the m&ms tho I was about to ask for a cup of them bc I thought she forgot them  pic.twitter.com/1NTbH0HgHk. Joey just started watching Supernatural what universe am I in. I bought too expensive sweatpants today but they’re so soft and not see through and pockets don’t make weird bulges. PSA!! Don’t wait several months to report a missing package! It makes it harder to find and sometimes the USPS tracking info has expired !!  rest ya brain. I’m always restocking so no worries! I’m gonna place my order tonight or tomorrow most likely but I’m gonna order extra in prep for online orders and cons later in the summer.  thank you Liz. It feels like someone shoved a bunch of cotton balls in my ears and head guhhhhhhggg
My mom said she’d help me w plush mailing so I don’t get y’all sick
Should be home late tonight. LMFAOO tomorrow is prob gonna be me in bed blowing my nose and making shipping labels .. happy birthday . I’ve heard the word hoagie like ten times take me home. The number of times this has happened to me... LRT what the fuck no get over here instead
Also real talk is he gonna survive. Pain is getting worse again sushsjshshs I gotta get back on the pill but I’ll have so many side effects again. Having a uterus is no good Lemme tell ya. This is literally the ugliest knock off pin I have ever seen how dare they not only steal from u but fuck it up so badly while they’re at it yiiikes. YOOO WHAT that’s not how commissions work buddy and if it’s like a sketch or at con it’s much less of a process 
Tbh tho I did $5 doodles this weekend and wrote No Refunds seriously it’s a doodle and I was still worried abt this. Anyway, your art is great and they were Wrong.. Listen to your artist friends, not some rando  . Stopping for dinner then half an hour home !!! I’m so curious to see if puppy is happy to see us or mad we left for so long . I’ve been actively looking for a cute fannypack but haven’t found The One yet :(. AAA CONGRATS DANI THATS SO EXCITING. (Yelling). Omg ...picturing at ita fanny pack Rn .

Omg it’s  the Kirishima sticker all over again. Omg what these are pretty dang cute..and I have to go there to return the grids I bought when I flew to acen so NICE!! Thank you!!

Have you tried Posca markers yet? They seem to keep popping up and I’m thinking of trying a small set .. whhaaaaat I’m so jealous !! Aaaa thank you for the support!!  (ps your hair is awesome). Yeah!! I bought a tiny original and I was like “is this marker or gouache?” And it was these!! The blue and magenta she used are sooo bright. I missed these!! The primary color one is esp stunning. You ever see an artist undercharging so badly you wanna shake them by the shoulders because —-.  thank you!! Aaa Yes!! I have family in Georgia and I had a really nice time at Momo!! My only regret is I didn’t get to run through the fountain at centennial park..maybe next year   if they let me in again I’ll be there!! Aaa thank you!! Woah! A big impact! Oooooh . Haha somehow I should’ve known to ask you?! Seems like something you’d use! Do you mind if I ask you what the opacity is like? . I’ve lost all sense of what is this cold and what is allergies..pollen is so bad here. Ohh!! I was wondering how that worked!! Very cool   Thanks for the info! Noted!! . @grimmfirefly  is out here crushing all my (unrealistic) merch hopes and dream. I love my mom - even though I specifically instructed her not to do this when she ran in the grocery store while I was laying in the car daydreaming of Benadryl pic.twitter.com/8s8SviETjg. IT MIGHT WORK. YEAH? I Just saw the prices for someones fic commissions the other day and I was like "ok but how many hours did planning and writing that take you bc if it's more than one then--". oh shit when u get an enamel pin idea when doodling a different enamel pin idea
my nose is flowing but so are the ideas#sick doodling#sick#think im funny. Sometimes I think about the illustration of The Wild Wild Pussycats and Deku -- and Deku's in his /gym uniform/ Horikoshi u coward. AA WELL... I CANT RECOMMEND IT SINCE I HAVENT DONE IT BUT???? It looks really fun????? Swimsuit cosplay day??? hahaha. Me too * U* They always waitlist me but I tend to get in later so let's cross our fingers!! \o/. You fucked up a perfectly good navigator is what you did---. I HAVENT SEEN IT AND THIS TWEET SCARES ME.

Guhhhh I get side effects for cold medicines but I gotta do smth or I’ll lose my mind. Clearly someone has made a mistake and I WILL fight them—. Fuck yeah. . Problematic twitter user zetsubooty hates gay dogs go to twitter jail , do not pass go do not collect $200. (But no I see your point abt phobias and some dogs are really chill but I know Cady would be so stressed out   It’s a lot for a human - someone who knows what’s going on and is tall enough to function- to handle so I can only imagine..). Same..I don’t feel ready to apply but watching some amazing artists I admire get denied is still Ouch. I didn’t finish reading the chapter yet but teary Fatgum is the only important thing . This lady should be Nejires mom just saying pic.twitter.com/8B5ywdxEfy. EX FUCKINGG CUSE U pic.twitter.com/ZHuZ0Rc0ii. Hello I need this man to leave my house so I can get up guhhhh I’m sick I’m not brushing my hair or getting dressed so leaveredhddjdn. I had to take a Benadryl bc I was sneezing and blowing my nose too much and now I’m like. Passing out. Drowsy. sneezed and almost dropped my computer on the floor. In Colombia most places charged to use the bathroom, or charged (or charged MORE) for toilet paper. i'mve lost all senes of time but I'm glad tomorrow Is Saturday because BNHA. The saga pic.twitter.com/jeqkZ8Tl2w. LRT I LIVE FOR THIS SCRUMPLE MOUTH BAKUGOU. ITS GONNA BE OK SON. Do you think we’ll make it to this part??!? (Cropped to avoid spoils for the anime only bbys) pic.twitter.com/hIA2AI5VG0. WNDNDJDJSJ I THINK THEY MUST..I HAVE NO SENSE OF PACING IDK WHEN ITLL CUT OFF but I think we should get this lil nugget. (This season I mean—-not today obviously  ). AWFUL BUT IMPORTANT. (Gestures to Bakugou)
“Why is he so bristly?”
“He’s a rescue.”
“/Ohhh./“. 10/10 would recommend to a friend. We’re just doing our jobs ma’am. Ah yes the best stage of any cold, nose bleeds. Shout out to my deviated septum for making bad things worse. Oh shit!! Good job, Sara!!   I’m glad it (seems like it) went well! I’d like to send them a handwritten thank you note. Aa I can't wait for all the anime-only folks who didn't "get" kiribaku to be like 'ohhhhh' after next week's episode. You don't have to ship it - I'm just saying you'll understand better! (..and maybe you'll ship it--- LOL). Cady has winter allergies and I have spring allergies and we make quite the pair. someones dock floated over to our property and we found them and told them but it's still here and it's been 4 weeks so I'm pretty sure I own it now yknow legally---- LMFAOO. LRT or support LGBT+ artists/crafts people!! There are also some people doing some rad fundraiser products this month!! Exhibit A:  https://www. instagram.com/p/Bjfm9xYDSvT/  . Should make a thread of all the rad artists/small businesses doing fundraiser products for pride.. IDK HOW TO FIND THEM THO.. pre ch 90: it's cute
ch 90: ITS REAL. AAA I JUST WATCHED THIS WEEKS EPISODE SHIT IS GETTING SO REALLLL
It's so awesome to see it in this format. “what time is it”
“what time do you want it to be”
“early enough to call the bank”
“It’s not too late”
“it’s Saturday”
“.....It’s too late”. Two good dogs @little_reddo pic.twitter.com/rs3YoHUONv. I’m tryna figure out how this person includes international shipping when the cost of the product is LESS than it costs to mail an item to most countries — not even including any fees, profit, cost for the item, packing materials, etc . Ehh I thought they ended that a while back?   USPS is never doing me any favors LOL. Dhdndjdjdj that must be nice.... my postal people are not happy people LOL. ahah I wish I had taken a more lively picture but it's too hot here for my dog to do anything but flop on the hardwood like this!   Yes,, I will take good care of Kurokocchi bby . Clearly this person can’t read /or/ use google. It’s tragic, really.. I had a dream I almost got with a cute girl at a con but then shit kept going down so I was running around instead and I ended up arresting Himiko Toga after shooting her twice (pun not intended) in the legs

 I don’t sleep very peacefully —- LOL. also at some point in my dream I was in Nejire’s POV and accidentally added “love you” when telling Tamaki bye by mistake and was like “..oops”. Ohmygod. Out of all the things to be commissioned to draw smut if you certainly lucked out . She was really cute I should draw her   “how did u come up w this oc” “(long pause)”. LRT is so accurate sometimes..like do you want the thing or not?? The last few times I almost got commissions people saw my post - knew my prices and ToS, emailed me, I said great let’s get started and they were GONE FOREVER.WHAT???why did you Email me?? If u had no intention of-. You ever look at one (1) bathing suit and then Instagram shows u swimsuit ads for like three days? The pure ecstasy of NOT digging thru comic pages and movie screenshots for refs. Ajdndjdjw I felt really sick last night and this morning but the headache and nausea are gone so now I’m just left w regular cold grossness
I think today’s the turning point in the cold but I have to be careful not to overdo it bc I ALWAYS overdo it and feel worse again. Getting sick sucks like I lose a week of my life every time and my deviated septum makes a bad thing worse..like without a cold I have to baby my nose so when this happens hell breaks loose VBKNVGKN. I remember the ENT specialist was like “wow you’re lucky your nose looks cute on the outside but inside it’s pretty much an S” LMFAOO LIKE ...THANKS??? >> away for two weeks
>> return home
>> dog Instagram stories increase by 4000%. Yeah!! I saw a lot of people talking abt seeing increased aro/ace hate the past few days . The worst part abt not posting project things is then a popular/famous artist will post smth similar and u gotta pray someone doesn't get on your ass abt it later. “If it’s on the floor it’s mine” pic.twitter.com/BEmjyikBen. Omg ..me too but ..also .....his MERCH PRICES WILL SKYROCKET AGAIN LMDAOK. I ALSO NOTICED THIS.. I just had the most idiotic pin idea . I haven’t screen printed in like a month I’m . Sad. This is the best thing I’ve ever seen. /shows mom toga x deku heart button
mom: aww it's cute
me: ...are we..watching the same show. real talk is Himiko ok I mean obviously no but--- like don't you wonder how people with certain quirks discover what their quirks are? LIKE HOW THE HELL DID SHE FIGURE THAT OUT WHAT POSSIBLY HAPPENED... you ever just sit and think about how good the dabi is a todoroki theory is. This is exactly what I pictured when I tweeted this!! my only ONLY explanation is when they were little kids they bit someone or were like 'i wonder what blood tastes like' (bc i think we all must wonder that at some point??? when we're little???idk). asdf That's a good theory too but -- ok one of my biggest BNHA pet peeves is the intro says 80% of people have quirks. That's only 4 out of 5. I know Deku wanted to be a hero really badly, etc. etc. but statistically there should've been several quirkless kids in his class alone? "I met a boy I'm interested in~"  

I got this as a doodle commission at Momo and I liked my sketch so.. ta-da! 

PS I ordered literally a few heart buttons of this bc no one will want them but if u do ....DM me LOL ( $5+ ship) pic.twitter.com/qGTXTHXi3t. --- I also made this much more pure heart button design of my best gal and her fluffy friend 

  Preorder@  http:// cambrasine.storenvy.com /     pic.twitter.com/OpuKqIE9SY. I'm still feeling pretty shitty but I think my contagious grossness is wearing off so I'm gonna see about packaging at least some of my orders tomorrow .. I'll wash my hands and try not to breathe on the merch but you may wanna swish it if you're paranoid. Huh. Yeah. Like one out of five people but we’ve met 1,000 characters and only two are quirkless? Or rather, are or were at some point quirkless .  Thank you! Always fun to draw this girl~~. Thank you Mai!!! Concerned would’ve been a better word to use. Sorry!! Horikoshi: 80% is really high
Us: actually ——. yikes tho what was he hoping to achieve..I wonder if he was just token straight dude there to start shit or incredibly Misguided LGBT community member. THIS EXPLANATION MAKES ME FEEL A LOT BETTER omg I was trying to parse why this person felt the need to put someone else down while compliment and maybe be racist while doing it   Tell your friendo I’m sure he has other talents!! What the heck show was this... Ok I saw a post arguing aro/ace peeps aren’t welcome@pride and it’s like if you’re not attracted to anyone?? Then you can’t be straight? Cause being straight is being attracted to the opposite...I don’t..understand. I don’t feel like I know enough to be qualified to discuss but. I think so too u mu I’m surprised there’s such debate I thought A was a solid part of the LGBT+ acronym.. Yeah I was reading some peeps wrote that ally shouldn’t be in it (fine, totally get it), some people don’t like queer bc it was a slur, and that intersex people asked to be removed a lot bc of x y z (I forgot the reason already  ). (to clarify their argument was just No Straights@pride and if you're aro/ace you're /aro/ace/ so i'm gonna need another argument thanks). OHMYGOD I SENT THE FILES AND FORGOT TO PAY yep that's not how you place an order...a great example of why placing orders while sick is a bad idea. I'm glad I checked on it orz. TT A TT aaa I tweeted this recently but my brother's gf is such a cutie she's so sweet........ Tell them to hang up and call 911 or if you think they aren't capable of doing that keep them on the line and call 911 yourself.. (I thought about this in the past for not as 'just curious' reasons SRDGIFHFGH). actually I didn't realize they're as cheap to produce bc I ordered a bunch for the zine soo -- for mutuals/friends just shipping or i'll throw it in if you already ordered/trading or smth :3 c. LMAFOOO I DIDNT COLOR IN ONE OF HER HANDS I'.M----. Ohh!! I see!! That makes a lot of sense!! Then yeah, even more reason for them to be included in pride........ sigh 
(softly) AU where everyone just gets along and accepts each other. “so how are you spending your weekend?”
LGBT people: celebrating ourselves and life and love together :)
That guy: in a hat, standing next to a group of people, hoping I get to fight someone. Yeah :( I’m sure it was there to an extent, but I didn’t see all this in previous years.. Agnès Sorel pin..poll in replies

Shoutout to @villainsbn  for the text..she was probably joking but here we are pic.twitter.com/nKyjTRwJrK. (Image in op). (Context) pic.twitter.com/DxhKrbCp10. YESS I wanna see your Hawks . This is a RELATABLE TWEET. Good luck with everything! My mom asked if I was ok and she was like just sit for a minute honey and I’m like IVE BEEN JUST SITTING FOR A WEEEEEK djdjdhd I need more vitamin c or something. erhfsg tryna mail orders but since i'm still waiting on restocks I HAVE some of these charm but not with the glitter so I'm not about to rob y'all of glittery fun.

I WAS JUST TOLD TO EXPECT MY PROOFS IN THE NExt..FOUR HOURS? what is this place---. aaa I always say I'm gonna but never do!!! I just got..really sleepy..soo maybe in a few..z...z.z.zzzz. SNORT  
I don't think it'll be popular enough but I still..WANTt TO LOL. ,..........I LITERALLY JUST ORDERED STICKERs like /in the last 10 minutes/ and this Did Not occur to me D:. I made this cute lil gal as tiny stickers to give away at cons if you skip the pLASTIC (i.e. multiple sleeves, bags for things that don't come bagged, etc.) 
SO. MUCH. PLASTIC. in artist alleys. It stresses me out and there was a thread a couple weeks back about doing this!!  pic.twitter.com/V4zQkXhMel. Ack!! She’s hard to see bc I uploaded it transparent again.. Also while paper can be recycled/degrades faster it can be just as bad or worse bc of all the water used for producing it??? Maybe?? I’m not a scientist but I think I read this !! And yeah ugh I hate those paper bags anyways. If you’re gonna display your print in a sleeve fine but if not and you have one already JUST COMBINE THEM..!? ALSO LESS SLIPPERY THINGS TO CARRY !! ALSO I GIVE U A STICKER NOW. @ pukaparade. NSJDJS SOMEHOW I read mousepad instead of mouse and I was like “I highly doubt that” . Ugh this is true they’d just encourage each other...now I’m imagining what that shopping trip would look like???? Kiri buying more crocs, Mina with like a feather boa and some tacky looking animal print . First viewing: Ohh that art style is.. Of course it’s hamlet’s!
Second viewing: —-OHMYGOD THE TITLE IS A PUN
Third viewing: (the topmost text) spiTsJDBDHDJDBDBDN. I doodled some ribbon dancers. It was nice. ACK I know but smth is better than nothing? I seriously wanna ask if I can not have my keychains individually bagged bc sometimes if I'm doing smth like the gacha or adding parts that make it bigger I'm just literally throwing them away immediately.. OHH I LIKE THE WASHI IDEA!!! Yeah same I've also been forgetting to order bags a lot so I've been ASKING if they want. some people are like nah i'm good, most people if they get multiple -even if it's more than 2/can't be view simultaneously- are still down for bagging together. LMFAOO I... I ordered 4 x 6 sticker sheets for the zine and they emailed me like We moved some stuff around and I was like uh oh so I open it and it's like it's now 6 x 4 and it's exactly what I uploaded and???SO DID U..JUST ROTATE IT..OR???? sgdfhh when I ran out of bags once this one person was unhappy w me and I've seen people online like huff huff "if i'm paying 10-20$ for a print then the LEASSTTT you can do is give me a bag" and i'm :|. LMFAOO I REMEMBER THAT I was like "you two need to stop"   Packaging is cute and as much as I would love it..it's wasteful!! I think the only one I can defend is backing cards for enamel pins bc it's popular to display it that way in stores..should one..get their pin in stores.. whic reminds me of a THING I DIDNT TELL U. Doesn't it usually do that on the 5th or 6th? Wow.. there's no way EVERYONE defaulted........ D: I'm looking into setting one up for a project so I think I read the 1st thru 5th or 6th so If it's not done by tomorrow or the next day you'll def need to get in touch w support.. I WISH YOU LUCK!! I’m gonna stop having mental breakdowns abt these plush and ship them out tomorrow I promise . My eyes have stopped LEAKING and my nose has stopped running so I’m good to go ok. This is sorta well known but Jewish chicken noodle soup. Well, maybe just chicken noodle soup but my grandma would argue it had to be Jewish to work . HOW DO U EAT A HOT DOG FROM THE SIDE?!! nOoooooo. HSJDJD I DID THIS THE OTHER DAY and thought about it for a long time. NDNDJD I Actually don’t have a lot of this bc of that?? I’m picky   I want all of those buttons tho..that are Horikoshi’s drawings / manga style ..Djfndjdn . OHMYGOD NO I THOUGHT U WERE JOKINGGGGG MY EEEYYYEEESSS. AAA I HAVE THAT TOO!! Matching u vu.  He deserves better. A true artist.... Also is it just me or nipples have become a huge theme around here (my twitter/art) lately. I’m sorry / you’re welcome #freethenipple. Sign my  http:// change.org    petition ——. I can’t tell if those of you liking this are like “yeah ..we noticed” or “u go girl” LMFAOO. (I’m giving the boys a once-over to check for defects but getting tired and..)

Me: if I don’t open this one and check him he’ll be the ONE that’s missing the embroidery or something 
Me: (Opens)
Plush: missing embroidery 
Me: ... General functions:  
ESP: . Nice!!   You lucked out! Safe travels~. Omg this is an amazing idea. I neglected the kiri zine twitter and tumblr a bit while I was away but hopefully I’ve made up for it ..With all the zines gone wrong lately (mods disappearing, packages never being sent, funds being hoarded or misused, etc.) I know people need extra reassurance!! . LRT give them money we were con neighbors and they seemed cool and I want this bag?? . Me: eats a bunch of junk food and takes one probiotic
Me: is this self care. I was caught off guard by how much this sounded like “I’m running to the convenience store, anyone need anything?” . you should consider putting Eri on top   I drew smth similar but cut her out for composition purposes and at my last con everyone was like “aww if only Eri were there”!LMFAOOO now I gotta draw another — . I THOUGHT SO IT WAS GOOD I ENJOYED IT. BDHDJD THATS SO CUTE W THE APPLES..I have another big 3 and a Mirio and Eri print I wanna do..IM IN DEEEEEEP   I’m excited to see what you make!! Welcome to  cambrasine 's social media accounts our theme is N I P P L E S. I revamped the buttons  pic.twitter.com/sYxjMaMDNZ. I'll be there next time

I'm Jennie! I'm a printmaker and illustration student, ready to keep working + improving this year!!  

e-mail    cambrasine @gmail.com
web   http:// cambrasine.wixsite.com/portfolio   pic.twitter.com/n0GpkHegaJ. (Unrelated but felt like it was a good excuse to say it: I admire you + your work. It's been great to see someone the same age/from our school achieving so much already. I was too shy to say hi@school, but I want to wish u good luck &I hope our paths cross again in the future!). Yes!! Planning another drawing of them already.. I'M IN DEEP w these good kids!! After Much Struggle (see my insta story..) Buttons: Made
 1st batch is done..I’d keep going but it’s 3 AM, gonna start making mistakes. that would be bad so.THE REST 2MORROW. I’m also Feeling better!felt bad this morning but tonight I feel like a person for the 1st time in a week. pet peeve: when people tag their friends on posts in fb groups they aren't in and it literally says 'this person can't see this post bc they aren't in the group' and they still do it and do nothing about it srdfgdgff OK GOODNIGHT. I did, in fact, give them bodies btw, they were just even messier than the heads HAHA pic.twitter.com/wpFX8oenVN. I hate this  https:// twitter.com/ihop/status/10 03682801042915328   …. Mm I wonder if moving to LA for illustration is a smaller version of moving to LA for acting?  Like not all the jobs are there but /a lot of the jobs are there/? I was under the impression  LA+NY were like the hot spots but I keep seeing more+more artists I follow move to LA . Omg now that I think about it this content kinda reminds me of you/Chris w those yoi dolls—- . Ahh, *inhales*
the sweet sweet smell of getting more attention on something that took you ten minutes than on something that took you hours 
.
.
( ..I still love y’all tho..thank you.). Ehh I understand how you feel. Just yesterday I saw an artist I admire draw something great in/about her depression..I think it’s just like people just dealing with things differently like anything else...and we didn’t luck out of the art-productive-negativity lottery . I’m glad there are people who can translate their feelings into drawings though, it makes for some really interesting concepts!! You ever see fan art where someone did just such a good job dressing the character in something they would TOTALLY wear and you’re like. Yes. You understand. Ive been om a good couldn’t fall asleep til 6 last night ..well, this morning rather ..and now I’m like?? Do I keep sleeping?? Get up and nap later? get up and NOT nap later? I’m tired and I have things to do idk which plan allows me to have the most energy .. WHATT THE FUYHCKCMCNFN. Omg this is s great idea!! I designed lil Bakugou and kiri  for pocket screen printing but I never made them . The number of times I’ve considered making neopets merch is stupid. THE PROBLEM BEING LIKE WHAT WOULD I EVEN DRAW just my long lost neopets?? . THAT IS LITERALLY EXACTLY WHAT I DREW IM DYIN——. The problem was to do that id need to sew the pockets on after printing... and I can’t sew...@grimmfirefly  collab . Aa yeah the only AA merch I saw was Aisha!! my first neopets were a yellow kacheek and a blue shouru..my bro had a green jubjub and my mom’s faves were kiko and blumaroo!...for some reason kiko is still v compelling LOL. LMFAOO WE talked about collating before but I do not think this is what she had in mind . If the person is good at maneuvering tho this could work for being pinned UNDER the pocket too. I remember when they added ixi and I fell in love. usul is so weird and cute too tho!! God this is making me nostalgic af. I’m bad at creatures tho... @pukaparade  get on it. Aaa I had a striped poogle!! I think I adopted it.. I was also in way too deep I ran some guild that would like ?? Adopt neopets, make them more desirable and find people to adopt them? IT MAKES NO SENSE BUT I SPENT SO MUCH TIME ON IT. Me: why do all the new versions look like they’re ready to fight 
(A whisper in the back of my brain): so they can hold things and they can sell the things they hold for real $. Guys I don’t think I’ve ever told anyone this. For some reason I didn’t wanna put my pets in the hotel so when we went to Disneyland when I was 8 someone offered to take care of my pets and I gave them my password. Y’all can guess what comes next. WHAT? How did they escape conversion??(wow this sounds like we’re talking about religion or ..worse things..). This is insane. My mom is giving someone her email over the phone and she said “no spaces” and I fucking. So neopets sticker sheet or what.   I hate this.. I WILL GET BACK TO THIS SOMEDAY... I started w cute neopet heads and quickly devolved into shitpost level sitkcers like the money tree w $ shades and end poogle racing. This is gonna be so stupid I’m excited but AGAIN I GOTTA DO IT LATER I HAVE LIKE 4 other things I need to draw first. Right here with ya bud. For some reason I always mix up Peru and Portugal. Even tho I literally went one of those places. IT ALWAYS TAKES ME A MINUTE TO FIGURE WHICH IS WHICH CONTINENT . I called to ask if they had posca pens (they did) and to end the she said good luck . First he was quirkless, now he’s backingcardless..poor bby cant catch a break. LRT awkward Bakugou and Tokoyami small talk: things I didn’t know I needed. "Look at the shape of that cloud, it's so weird..it almost ooks like the top of a tree."
(It was the top of a tree)
Wear your glasses, kids. OK MORE BOY PACKING TIME. ((VIBRATES)) why didn't they scan my packages today.....?? I really wanted them to be scanned. Idk why I just. really think it would've made me less anxious. They've done this before at that location tho (sigh) so it's probably fine.just....irk. aaaa their style suits them so much?!?! <3. I have so many questions. so anyone got a good kiribaku playlist...asking for a friend. OhMYGOD. So many parts of this are amazing..double decker plane.."We can't find the leak" "*hard shrug* ok whatever" srdightygyjhf. why does sm*rtpress site go down so often??? same ; n;. LRT RSEFJSDGFfd I want .. but our recent trip was expensive (Even with the income from cons since we roamed in between + bought some cool art!!). lrt woahh those are some pretty Minas!! and hydrangeas!!!! Poor pup hadn’t got an off-leash/woods run in a week since we both got sick so she ran her little legs off today and she’s totally passed out . Hdhdhd I only did a lot over two thirds of my package goal for today but to be fair I also broke my button maker...eventually my mom stabbed the part I got stuck w scissors and pried it out bc she’s?? A genius??? A monster??? Anyway it’s fixed ish. I also doodles#d on everyone’s package /hit. Wow I fucked up both of these tweets *I did just over two thirds of my package goal for the day 
* I doodled.  Thank you!! I hope you like him!! (Psst mutuals/friends I was able to identify got an extra button and the puffiest boy hehe ;) ). @ pukaparade  ? This cold sucks I felt mostly better the past two days and now I’m having new symptoms. DSGRJFOHGDJLGJdfgfdhgfjhh <- That'll probably be my response for the next few updates at least. I've been a bit bad about this lately myself but posting on social media when you buy someones stuff at a con or online is !! REALLY HELPFUL!! Headed to the post office with my very reasonably sized bag of packages thanks pic.twitter.com/6cmnXU7Xw8. pic.twitter.com/lSiAX5gQ8u. My mom was guessing the names of neopets to see if she could remember them. I pointed to the penguin one (Bruce) and my hint was “The Hulk’s name”
And she goes “Steve—“ and I think she’s about to say Steve Rogers but she says STEVE BANNON anyway I’m dead now. omg like 6 weeks later they finally took their dock back and I MISSED IT and cady was prob freakin' out here. OK!! PSA I don't take care of my charms well, but hypothetically here's how: If you have an acrylic charm where the image is exposed on one side, I've seen people coat that side w nail polish to avoid chipping. Idk if I can really recommend that bc some nail polish discolors.. you could also try a resin..Some people use washi tape but that could also cause problems over time or maybe rip the ink off it it tears.. As for protecting them in general, there are kinda clunky rectangle protectors that you can put them in, or you can DIY it around the shape:   https:// myfigurecollection.net/blog/34216  . Otherwise I'd say if you put your charms on smth like your keyring or wallet that you throw around a lot, I think them getting a lil wear and tear is just part of life ; n;. THIS IS SO CHARMING AND BEAUTIFUL and your choices to blur parts and the gif versions ...damn... Really well done . LRT AAa go real the extra panels too they're great. I personally dislike mod podge bc in my experience it yellows and remains tacky eternally.. there may be more qualified people in like the ita bag Facebook group :( I’m not an expert . (PS cONGRATS!). This is so pure. Usually Aleve is my go-to for migraines, cramps etc. but the last two times even tho it made my pain go away it also made me like??? So sweaty?? Is my heart beating fast? Idk dndnnfdn I’m hungry I had half a sandwich today (yesterday) so that’s not helping. Oh no I just remembrrrd I gotta be up in like 5 hours to have a doctor tell me go back on birth control or suffer forever, those are your two options bc we don’t care enough abt uteruses or the people who have them to find a real solution. Horikoshi: wanna see Endeavor for a whole arc?
Me: pass. I’m sure he has an important role yadda yadda but please give me back my kids

Excited to see everyone fall for Hawks tho . These are good lips. (Softly) give in to temptation. LRT AAA FORGOT ABT NANA IN ALL MY KIRIBAKU EXCITEMENT. MY DUMB ASS DIDNT RECOGNIZE YOUR NAME I WOULDVE GIVEN U EXTRA STUFFFFFFF.  I’m glad he’s settling in and making friends already . Pro tip: always write in the notes at checkout if we’re friends/mutuals!! I will!! Give u thing. Ok really how hard is it to CLOSE the box you opened?   come on .. and if they’re down to rip things open they should be equipped to close them anyway!!!
Ugh sorry this happened, glad damaged merch was minimal. LRT ah the joys of flying to conventions. This is a mood. YES CAUSE I FELT SO BAD LOL Some ended up wonkier than others . It was just frustrating bc the sample process was so easy and then everything after was like pulling teeth   Thank you for understanding . Stupid merch idea of the day:
Kirishima “Not all heroes wear shirts” (instead of capes). (Softly) I bet your eyebrow scar is hella cool. LRT blessed content. PS plush people - I did my best but let me know if you’re missing something!! (If you have extra things that’s fine I did it on purpose). THAT LAST PART SOUNDS REAL FAKE BUT I MEAN IT. WHAT. GOOD LUCK!! I hate this. SWEATING... don’t enable me (please enable me). ....I’ll look@the list and get back to you...... My Big 3 collection so far!! Minus a Nejire button I misplaced and my own pin (whoops)

OHHh hNOooo making this post is bad for my wallet. (You may be better off messaging her tbh! They go pretty quickly!). guhh people seem to be using tictail more..should i make a tictail too...guhhhhhh. should i make a stupid tictail. LMFAOO IT DOES BUT IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYONES THERE THESE DAYS and some people aren't crazy enough to check etsy, storenvy, AND tictail like me so. I fuckin DID etsy and then they took off all my popular shit. can u tell im' not over it LOL. aaaa lemme know.. I looked a few weeks back with no luck ; n; I only ever saw that one post forever ago but uh I don't know mandarin so that wasn't super helpful. I'm very low-key on etsy but they took down my most popular listings so now i'm like ???? put on other things?? or how many strikes do I get? ack. mom: LOOK AT THE DOC MARTINS PRIDE BOOTS, come on those are cool
me: are u gonna wear them
mom: noncommittal noises. Matsuri charms (even tho I didn't write the names? just tagging qualifies you for takedown), rescue charm ; n;. MM sometimes they don't mean that tho.. Sometimes they'll say 1000 and their minimum is 100, sometimes it'll say the minimum is 100 and it's 1000... I'll message them ; u; Thank you!! when I took my SATs they misprinted the time limit for a section so, unable to determine which students had 60 mins and which had 90, they threw out the whole section. Many peoples scores were below expected, mine included bc I nailed that section     https:// twitter.com/i/moments/1005 152124580319233   …. It was fine bc my school isn’t exactly renowned academically and I was still every comfortably safe for admission, but I’m sure it affected a lot of kids where it DID matter and that sucks. A lot. how am i supposed to sleep
when episode 48 is going to happen. <3 <3 <3. same u nu If you see a weird cut in your package it's bc I DIDNT TRUST MYSELF AND REOPENED AND RESEALED It. WHAT THE fuck THis is so good

(SHAKES FIST AT HAWKS). part of my brain is like completely rejecting their work as music and another part is like fucking galaxy brain this is the best thing i'vev ever hearohmygod. If you’re like wow jenn there’s a distinct lack of ep 48 tweets on your twitter - I stayed up til 5 to watch the new episode and now I’m dead. (Softly) murder? True fans destroy their sleep schedule and give themselves migraines 

(This is sarcastic btw don’t@me). Same. nooooOoooo my one weaknesssss. Ohmygod y’all are too much. LRT I cannot get over his face , literally last night I yelled LOOK AT HIS FACE when this happened . T POSE T POSE T POSE. Soooooo.. is now a good time to shamelessly promo my linking charm?

(Or whichever you’re missing  ). IS IT HAPPENING I CANT FIND ANY INFO. I wrote on the fb page a few days ago like ????hello. I have two August shows so I’ll have the check the date but if it works out I’ll be there!! I’ve never done it before :o. Aaa I’m glad you like them!! Thank you so much . Aaaa what a soft fam   Thank you for your support!  Very. wfseg reposted rescue charm on insta too and it's got like 2-3x the#of likes i usually get ...thank. TT A TT NANA... TOO KIND  
sad quiet moment post- all-the-shit. ASDFDSGFS THEY TOTALLY ARE THO.. https:// twitter.com/cambrasine/sta tus/1004261707215261697   …. mom: I hate to say this..it's technically only...9 weeks to otakon
me: *TWITCHES VIOLENTLY* rtjdigfhFHFHGGFJF. IM FUCKnig dEAD. me: hmm I don't have to, but I could do this in a way where I make more work for myself
me@me: why.  Thank you!! I'm glad you enjoy it~. TT A TT   Thank you!! Aaa I saw!! I'm waiting on my restocks still so I'm sorry it's a bit later than anticipated;; Can I throw something in for you to make up for it? ;) ;). (Sobbing). I LOVE HIM. You’re welcome. Gorgeous!! (I find smth charming abt the consistent line weight ?? In this piece and in general in artworks). This person sucks and should be blocked from seeing all art until they learn to appreciate it. Ps Dabi was there on THE FUCKING GROUND bye. Ok that Instagram post has now gotten 7-10x the usual attention. I’M HAPPY+GRATEFUL, gained followers, giveaway soon but -

It also makes me frustrated bc I feel it proves how many ppl “like” your art relies on how many ppl SEE your art which is based on freaking /algorithms/. this design is always popular (+tags)so people liked it so they show it to more and more people: cool

But normally if I draw smth not popular w everyone it shows a small#of people, if the people they happen to show it to don’t like it then they don’t show it to anyone else.. Like I have a lot of BNHA loving followers obviously but others follow me for say magical girls or mermaids or smth else so if they show the people who only love bnha the magical girls then the ppl who like magical girls may not see it bc it wasn’t “well-received” yknow. My momma has food poisoning :( which means no black market, no fun outing, but I’ll get some shit done since I’m home . it's so nice outside but the pollen is Destroying me and we're out of tissues /and/ toilet paper. I LOVE YOU ALL MIGHT I DONT HAVE TIME TO DRAW U UBT ILOVE YOUMAN. tfw you're taking a 'what character are u' quiz and you have to stop bc it asks you what star wars character u relate to but you've never seen star wars..any star wars...at all..help.

I was between the two of them . DSFGHDFH BACK AT YOU BUD
ps I need some of your soul eater prints soon.............. tbh if AA heads didn't yell@you when you don't have a badge preordered I'd always be late. oh no youtube decided to play a  sad playlist why this :( :( :(. DSFGDG CADY KICKED ME..HARD..she's still asleep? how?! call out post for photoshop and myself: when PS glitches and I have to quit and reopen but instead I just quit and 15 minutes later I'm like '..what was I doing again?'. IS THIS,..IN RESPONSE TO SMTH. when it's 4 am and your self confidence is so low the best you can say about it "maybe this won't be /so/ bad..". The last few episodes I’ve also watched the English dub purely out of curiosity and I just remembered Deku muttering a bunch and - I think it was Momo - goes “This is peak Midoriya” and I LOST IT. Damn the people at ihop are whack. You don’t just change the name of your restaurant bc one menu item starts selling better than another!!  You think Every “house of pizza” sells Pizza the most bc that sounds real fake. Yeah there were some moments where I was like WOW THEY BOTCHED THAT - like uraraka abt Bakugo unwilling to accept help turned into “lol idk guys...” and I was like why did you do this...BUT YES THERE ARE SOME PRIME LINES TOO.  Thank you so much!! I hope you like what I create in the future   aaa I wanna make a soul eater print sometime.. “If I used to hop on over to ihop do I now have to hobble on over to #ihob  ?” - My mom, asking the Real Questions.  Thank you for all the compliments and the support!! I’m really glad you like everything and that it all arrived safely!! (PS If you do start a fantasy kiri bag you should totally get @llllucid  ‘s rubber strap - it’s soooo nice!!). Aaa I’m glad he arrived safely!! Omg this pic of you holding his head is so sweet?!  take good care of him!! I’ve been taking really bad care of myself the last few days working on stuff(endless hours on screens, staying up til 3-6, getting out of bed in the afternoon, etc) so I’m gonna keep working a bit today but also like take a breath and a shower,go see my boy tomorrow,get outside. Abdnddjn omg!!! He’s honored hahah Please take photos . ahah It seems like everyones' is arriving today!! I'm glad he made it safely~~ TT A TT Thank you for your patience!! Take good care of him! . DSFGHIFGHSERENNAAA...YOU'RE TOO KIND.. OH. I REALLY LIKE THESE. YOU LOOK SO CUUUTEEE! They really suit you! THANK YOU BUT... pic.twitter.com/dcFDG8pnXG. ?! He’s big now?? That’s ok !! Small is better since there’ll be no room on my bag anyway..whenever I actually make it . SDGBMMCJRNNSSKDJSN THIS IS THE CUTEST THING IVE SEEN. Sjnddbdbdn it used to be “ch 90 killed me” and now it’s “so 48 killed me”!! So disorienting . Ok I’m gonna try to get all the remaining packages I can (not preorders) sent out tomorrow. Can I do it. AAa I'm glad you and Kiri had safe travels!! . AA Thank you for the support!! TT u TT <3 I'm glad he's found a good home~~. delays w the kiri zine have been stressing me (I’m still waiting on charm outlines?!?) but certain things are out of my hands and it’s not worth rushing for unreadable books and  $ xxx  taken from donations so I’m glad I made the post..hopefully I won’t get too many angry messages. LIKE IVE BEEN REALLY STRESSED and my friend pointed out I need to chill out bc it’s really not that big a deal but I don’t want tons of emails like WHERES MY ZINE on June 15th since it said mid June . KFNDJDJ THANK U.... ps when the proof arrives I’ll send pics to everyone to make sure the credits are how ya want before the final printing!! there's been an incredibly buzzy fly in the house all day and Cady is So Pissed. OH NO THIS LOOKS REALLY CUTe................ This project is cursed I’m so sorry I’m really trying pic.twitter.com/0lxg1HBXKL. Alright I tried to fix my button maker and it broke even more. Time of death, 7:25 PM.....fuck. call out post for myself: I don't draw todoroki enough. tfw you're trying to order clothes but there's no size chart
like having an inaccurate size chart is one thing but NONE AT ALL IS P RETTY BRASHERGdgifhh. Omg how is this drama cd even real. Why do men talk so loud it’s like shhhhh I’m right next to you. I Haven’t watched it in forever but DAISUGA IS CUTE ...bc .. SUGA IS CUTE   He’s my best boy. Follow for more soft Yiddish movie trailer commentary pic.twitter.com/asGcQu6YYo. I hate hate haTEEE I can never ever find miraculous episode without seeing spoilers of all the important stuff guhhh noooo why where can I watch this I already saw the thing /sobbing. Guuuuhhh took several days instead of a few hours for charm outlines. she asked me to write out my order even though she normally does it so I did but I made a mistake (because it’s..not my job and I messed up) so now it got confusing /lays down. Yeah like she had me write out all the style size etc which she normally does and I fucked it up and she didn’t check til now and then said reply ASAP or it’ll have to wait til after the break so I did at like 4:30 am and then she was like it’s too late now it’ll have to wait. I am Unhappy. Yeah..i purposefully didn’t order some designs so we can try that new place before ota/Flame. lrt i like todoroki but he isn't my best boy but he has his moments for me and this is one of them--- what a GOOD BOY. aaa ok now that the whole fam is involved i'm more interested in this arc..thanks horikoshi. Aa shouto’s bro looks totally different !  He’s cute tho. AAA YOU LOOK SO GOOODDD!!! lrt um this is the cutest shit I can't believe this is official. lrt I DONT..LIKE THAT AT ALL. Ground! ZERO!!! I just bought a piece of clothing off a questionable website for the first time in years.. send me good vibes bc I can't find anything like it anywhere else . Ehh I don’t play the games so I don’t know enough  (softly) im just sayin ground zero sounds cool af ...im sure someday we’ll find out his real hero name in the manga.. . LRT OHMYGOD..thank you animators..wow . Guh my eye has been itchy in and off and slightly ever so slightly mucus-y for like three days but like not bad enough to seem like it’s /something/ and it’s ??? This took me a long time bc I have few /strong/ ship feelings aside from kiribaku   pic.twitter.com/yV2yvqZlsV. Here you go! pic.twitter.com/XL38jVQEV1. Thank you   I felt a /little/ bad for left boy so not as big of a smudge. FUCK I FORGOT I like that a lot...feelings made better by (softly) financial security   I kept looking at Iida like “don’t I like him w someone” but I was too distracted by thinking abt getting yelled at by people who both do and don’t ship k*tsu/deku . Tape!!!! pic.twitter.com/CnkyAIujxv. Softly there’s a lot of Cady hairs in this photo ..sorry. You’re welcome . Mmm ok it’s been four or five months since I messed with my hair..I’m gonna try for blonde again and maybe light pink a bit after.. Stupid red hair dye I never wanted better not get in the way . lrt "gay intended" is a good phrase. wheeze ok if a place said they'd touch base w me in a couple weeks and it's beeeeen 7 weeks....it's reasonable to reach out to them again, yes? don't wanna let opportunities slip away /lays down. I hope I didn't wait too long either.. HEeckk YES. omg mimikyu is such a good match for toga... Yeah!! It’s not like a job, it something ongoing so I don’t think it’s too late so!! Thank you!! Wish me luck!! tryna watch this tutorial but this lady keeps saying brown when it's orange and i. yIKES. lrt except we all know we're all cryin again anyway. my boyfriend's sister's boyfriend looks like a zac efron / dave franco hybrid and I find it very distracting. I can't get over Bakugous' rose embroidered vest its like?? one of my boys?? did FASHION? like I wish I could show y'all so you'd understand. Hate messages are so wild?? I haven't really gotten any about my art.. I think it's what happens when you've got a big chunk of followers? People see you doing well+wanna cut you down cause they're jealous or don't like your ship or whatever bs is running through their mind :(. But I can imagine it's hard to ignore it when their playing to insecurities you already have..Just try to give more weight to your friends and followers who say you're lovely and your art is lovely because we're the ones who are right ;). I can't believe you -- liking TWO popular shows?! It's like, who even /are/ you anymore??

(what the heck is wrong with people). GOOD LUCK!! also by earlier than anticipated I meant nearly /on freakin time/ bc they're consistently late LOL. { RT Appreciated! } New   buttons and restocks arrived today!

Get ‘em@ http:// cambrasine.storenvy.com   pic.twitter.com/ybYLdHnyCl. AU where everyone reads the preorder dates instead of individually emailing me   I love y’all but please..The amount of time I spend answering questions that are answered in the listing is wild. Also I do have some other emails to answer/send (that are order/person specific) which I will be doing tonight!! Grey warned they would be pushing the KiriKami Agenda. Thank you!! I had fun fitting them into the shapes :3.  thank you!! Remember in February when I told my stylist I’d use this treatment every week but then used it only twice since then. me: time to get some work done
bf: i'm at the ER again
me: nevermind. thanks liz ..it seemed like things were going really well but I know relapsing is often part of the process ; n; <3 /hugs back. Today has been a day. I’ve answered some emails, I’ll do a few more and finish tomorrow, sorry. aaa hopefully I get to be blonde again tomorrow! I hope it goes well...it would be a nice pick-me-up.. teenage me: the only colors of hair I'd hate to have are blonde and red
me last april: blonde (stopped halfway to pastel dye)
me last december: red (mishap). It was hard not to get my hopes up since he seemed to be doing better but recovery is a long road + it really hasn't been long since he started getting proper help so. It's gonna be a process and I should know that by now with all the people I've known who struggled w addiction.. Mom: this is good til May 6th—- what day is it?!
Me: looks into camera. Fuck. It seems like he’s doing really badly. Fuck. I’ve resorted to crowd sourcing what to say to get my stupid boyfriend to do inpatient. I HATE THIS POST. I’m sure I would’ve noticed in the proof but the printing company told me about a typo   Above and beyond haha. Just tryna get his dumb ass to agree to inpatient but he’s stubborn and still inebriated from yesterday anyway  /sigh
Thank you though . Ughh idk why that lady ever did red it’ll never go away..I never asked for it hnnbcff. Before + after! 
Not my icy blonde from last year (rip) but a good start!  pic.twitter.com/5WxqiVumLw. Just tryna relax after last night..I feel guilty though for living like normal but his family is watching over him and I can’t do anything to help him right now..it’s up to him so.. WHAT DOES THIS TWEET MEAN THIS IS SO CRYPTIC. ????????????,,,,.  YES. pic.twitter.com/WU62u96DTv. Crane's and the diner are really my go-to happy place.. mom: So, " cambrasine "
me: THAT'S ME!! ...sorry, what? me: ok but how would a normal person know this
mom: they take a business course
called. out. LRT I M SORRY I LOVEu. follow my twitter for a mix of cool fan art and OUTRAGE. When my boyfriend relapses he always says smth like “haha sorry was so busy” and I’m like do u not remember talking to me when you were fucked up at the hospital u absolute butt. Yeah. Just the usual unfortunately   Thank you though . I’d love to do custom charm commissions if I’m ever not dying. LRT Don’t have to be Christian to know that’s fucked up. Tamaki cosplayers... pic.twitter.com/J0EbXKGk0k. I JUST READ A TON OF BAD ONE STAR REVIEWS COMPLAINING that this stuff came “dried up!” “completely solid” “unusable!” —- It’s a dry substance and you’re supposed to add water to it..Please read the instructions.. orz. Oh good I fell asleep for like 5 hours and now my head hurts like crazy gghbvcvh. yells into the abyss I placed my charm order 4,000 years ago and I'm not sure she even processed it. you're welcome. ngl these would be pretty fun. Science, eh?   
They're just like?? finger puppet type things that are tentacles! \o/ 
They'd be good for cosplaying this Amajiki Tamaki!! pic.twitter.com/FRWX0YsaGv. dfgrdfthDYOJYJ no!! /pats u. Aaa I'm glad it all arrived safely!! haha Ichigo won't be lonely anymore~~ Enjoy! For some reason my phone hasn't been showing me a lot of my replies/mentions lately? Like on the computer I saw all of them but they didn't show in the app..  So if I didn't reply that's probably why!! oh no are we gonna have fresh wave of mitsuki bakugou discourse on saturday. whoops i accidentalyl slept from like 6:00 - 10:00 so I just sent an email without realizing it was an unreasonable hour. I’m gonna lose it.  no thank you. Zine peeps - there’s a quick peek of the proof on my instagram ( Cambrasine ) story right now if you’re curious, but I’ll do a better one later today and post it properly! And for participants I’ll send yall your story/credits to look over for any changes. Yeah and then there was a mistake bc again I shouldn’t be doing her part of her job so I messed it up so she was like reply ASAP and I’ll do it before the holiday so I did even tho it was 4 AM and then she was like nah too late I’ll do it after the holiday. It’s been almost a week since then - the holiday was only from the 16-18 I think? - and she hasn’t written so I emailed but she didn’t reply and I’m fuckingbdjdndjdndn. Me: wow I wish I’d stop feeling so sick lately 
Me: /sees a (negative) twitter story about Burger King
Me: holy shit I want——. Yeah no after this I’m done I think..like I’ll still use occasionally for certain finishes and such  but I’m gonna try that other place - I specifically didn’t order certain designs again so I could try them so I’ll let u know when that’s happening.. Cady isn’t big on fruit..esp banana she’s like the fuck is this mush and licks it a few times before losing interest. Maybe it’s like owner like pet.. . I like uhh apples, cantaloupe, bananas.....maybe pears but I haven’t had since I was little...I don’t like berries :( ........ I like five foods I’m a child. My diet is Cheese bread chicken chocolate. Guhh been feeling sick the last several days..like all the symptoms of Lyme minus the tick/bullseye . Aaaa congratulations!! AND SEE YOU AT OTA!! Come by so I can get your signature on kiri zine?? I always try to get as many signatures as possible but it’s sorta futile with such international projects   Ohh!! That’d be fun!

For doodle commissions I did at Momo — if I didn’t know the character or it was an OC I drew them once for reference then again for the actual commission. Ugh when I get depressed abt my boyfriend and shit I like stay in bed for three hours after I wake up and that’s not good. It’s really nice out today too..stupid me. I’m scared . ...hold me .

Me: (whips out my iPhone on the way to dinner) anyone else still play Pokémon go? 
You + Caitlin: LOL NO. MMM NO IM 9,000% SURE THIS HAPPENED. I stopped playing shortly after that bc y'all crushed my hopes and dreams (jk, i stopped bc I got distracted/lazy)
Acton wasn't super hoppin' either :P. I do remember us all playing at BCC aka deadcon. y'all ever think of todorokis first hero outfit and just cry a little. Like I would show y'all but it was terrifying, I'd scar everyone. I want to never see it or think of it ever again. LMFAOO "NOW THATS WHAT I CALL CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT--". ...Can you tell I've never drawn Todoroki's hero outfit before /hit. something about eating fast food but /at home/ is so satisfying?? does anyone else get this? I also had this experience. I was like I don't understand, Alexis like Mew Mew so---...........oh. SERIOUSLY was it just part of his i'm not here to make friends' schtick//???? real talk I think this terrible outfit contributed to him not becoming my Best boy-- I am shALLOW ??? LMFAO.

IM SO GLAD I CAUGHT IT I’m a lil dummy who put the wrong zip code but I SWOOPED IN!!!   I’m glad you like it boo - in retrospect I should have drawn him smiling or w deku or smth I was just like (galaxy brain) citra likes.... TODOROKI . (Gently wipes your tears away). Important Question: Do you think when Deku was really little Inko could attract him w her quirk? There are cuter scenarios to envision but I’m just imagining she’s doing something and looks over and Deku is about to touch or eat something he shouldn’t and she’s like ZWOOOP. u wu. hey hey I'm glad we got our omanjuu but -- idk what they're called but the little bears I want bnha BEARS. I might finally buy an ita bag for Kirishima..... I have so many things just no bag ever.. I almost had a cute one made but then I thought it wouldn't have enough space ; n;. damn I'm looking at them again and they're pretty cool..gear shaped window........ but...space... HNN help. maybe I should assess my collection but my room is a nightmare. This is all I could find immediately  there’s probably a lot more... pic.twitter.com/lk7tpOkSuq.

Bf was gonna go to this in patient program next week that sounded really good, good reviews, good school association, incorporated therapy + nature etc. but I assume there was Another Incident bc now he’s checking in to this other one today Djfndjdn .it’s outta my hands now. It’s just crazy bc literally yesterday he sounded so upbeat and apologized again and said he was ready to try anything — then today he sounds totally defeated and this.. damn addiction ..sucks.. I'm so salty I saw gear shaped key-rings on vacation and I was SO EXCITED but none were red!! They had like orange and green and shit ; n;. I'm ...not a very crafty person orz ALL MY SKILLS ARE 2d. Hnn even regular AA apps are usually up/done by now ; n; So much adjusting..
srightdh TOO KIND...You can have your pick of whatever too!! <3 <3 <3. I'm just tryna picture what he wrote to the company like 'make it bland but also i want a light up eye or smth'. Something about fountain soda drinks at home..good shit. .....this is smart
I actually just looked and they come in black.. Ah, I'm sorry to hear that. Yeah he was doing out patient and didn't do shit and seemed happier for a few weeks but then gave in ; n; Hopefully the in patient programs will help him get through the thick of it again.. <3 Thanks for your well wishes!! omg! her quirk is actually very handy!! .  Chris makes tons of cute merch!!! --- Seriously, their table is overflowing w merch . Hnn It's so tough!! ... I could just curate it but it seems a shame ..... I think backpack style would be more comfy too..hmhmmhm. I prefer backpacks for some reason? Shoulder bags being my second choice but then the weight isn't distributed evenly ; n; The totes are cute but so inconvenient to hold.. Ohh!! That window sounds like a good compromise!! I hope it's a good size for you!! . I'M WEAK I caved and bought typohime's Kirishima..he's so fuckin cute tho this is not my fault .... now to acquire omanjuu, then I can rest. I know there were a few things I really wanted a few weeks ago but I think everyone's closed their shops for AX LOL ..like the big 3 dango person. ahh that is a good point!! ....gosh there's so much to consider when buying a bag..hence why I've had this pile of kiri merch growing for so long orz. /lays down 
bf told me to visit him and i said i would...turns out visitors arent allowed......i hope he learns that orz. I was happy to relinquish my role of main caretaker during crisis but his family was not proactive enough..today was super avoidable?! I told her to go w him to his room, have him give her the pills, but I don't think she did & if he got drugs through the mail last time then. you should known to get it first or hold the fucking mail! Be proactive..he should've got into inpatient days ago anyways but everyone was 'waiting til next week' for no particular reason. I'm not say it's their fault I'm just saying it could have been avoided w more attention.. He told them he took 25 pills?? if that were true he'd be dead?? esrdguodfg ... Ok I'm done tweeting about this for now...Sorry y'all. so @grimmfirefly  showed me the perfect ita bag that's not for sale and now we aren't friends anymore pic.twitter.com/487rSZX2tz. Fun insights into my life:
> I ate dry cereal with my hands for dinner
> I literally just gasped aloud and said Kirishima was not a passing phase. my mom keeps encouraging me to buy weeb things today what is happening. THANK YOU FOR VOTING BUT I decided against the gear windows u nu As cool as they'd be, I realized that the bag would also not have a zipper/closure which is not ideal for conventions, esp. with all the theft recently. I found a cute backpack tho so I'm makin moves u vu. I love Vance Joy but his music makes me wanna cry I low-key cried at his concert LMFAOO,.. IDK ITS THE STRUMM/ing OR SMTH they're all just very...feel very heart-tugging songs................... IDK THESE CHARAS BUT THIS IS VERY VERY CUTE. I was wondering if they were!!   They are precious.. JESUS..........................how did you even GET THESE. Horikoshi: sounds bad I’m not drawing that
. I had a dream that I wrote half a mean sentence in a reply to someone on twitter. They were excited for a plush they got and I accidentally tweeted half of a joke tweet abt people who suck and make fun of people for still liking plush but it sent so everyone thought I was making. Fun of them instead and I came back to like 65 notifications about it and had to try to photograph all the plush I own/around my room to try to price my innocence but it never looks like enough and my phone died. I had another dream where joey proposed to me before going into rehab (bc we were wondering if visits were family only and if I’d have to say I was his fiancé or smth wild) and I said I’d pretend for that reason but then he thought we were really engaged. Omg I love their work I’m so excited. YEsss. Please. LRT this is actually the fucking truth
I went to Disney once. My mom paid for a lot of it on credit cards bc she wanted to make sure we got to go when we were still young.

Okeey~ I bought a bag for the boy. and some gear-shaped carabiners for the zipper pulls u vu May cut some gear shapes out of adhesive black vinyl I have leftover or something to decorate a bit? ...I should get lights.. ideas welcome. /vibrates I can’t wait to see my new charm and the zine charm/pin!!!!

Well I just saw an alligator head while its body was being made into bbq goodbye internet i'm out. pst Do you mind if I put this pic in my instagram story and / or shop listing? I can link your twitter with credit? :3 c If you're not comfortable with that it's fine I just thought it was super cute! \o/. I didn't buy it but I reaallyy want to..maybe soon ; n;. Omg how did people think that dog really did cpr?? He’s just a cute cute good boy! He just laid his head down for the breathing parts and it was very cute. 5 am tweets ok goodnight. (Yelling) why are we both awake rn?? BUT THANK YOU SO MUCH!! but this project only exists because all you lovelies made the pages! . LRT the rest of y’all will have to wait a week or two, but the participants got the special preview~~~ I’ll post the cover and such tomorrow !   This was a big project for my first solo organizing gig but seeing everyone so soft in the group chat today was worth it. worried I'll arrange my whole ita bag and then I will buy or find in the depth of my room something I adore and NEED central and i'l die. lrt I wanna make incredibly extra merch like this. 100% a compliment. (knows I can't fit this 9" plush in my ita bag and still wants it)
Sorry I'm talking about buying stuff a lot but I bought literally 2 things, one of which was the bag after like 2 years of hoarding kiri merch in a pile. protips for attaching nitotans/plush to bag? I guess i'll just safety pin through the top loop ? idk D:. Ohh!! That’s a really neat idea! Unfortunately the part I’m putting them in isn’t big enough to hang them but I may try that for my deku bag   Thank you!! Ahh I think my problem is they’re in the front pouch so it isn’t tall enough to hang pic.twitter.com/FLV0MX3PGj. Damn I keep remembering good good kiri merch I have but can’t locate. YESSSSS YES YES. Uh I have no idea off the top of my head but not anywhere near as close as u bud   I think they’re up. THIS IS CLEVER!! Thank you!! There's no way this show will let me in - just like they didn't let me in last year - but I applied anyways bc Fuck It .. I hope they'll look at my screen prints and not my animu stuff like I told them to /lays down. hnn I'm thikning on two of my favorite kiri charms i want to be central on this bag but i have no idea where they are.......... can't believe what makes me finally clean my room after like 6 months is gonna be this fucking ita bag LOL THE THINGS I'LL DO FOR KIRISHIMA EIJIROU---. Good news: got a good start on my room!! Found the hardware for my display case so I FINALLY could put the shelves up  
Bad news: I started cleaning at like 1:30 and now it’s 4:15 and I h8 myself. I also found one of the two precious kiris I can’t find! Pretty sure the other one is in the art room tho..which moved entirely to the guest room for the floor and we haven’t touched anything since (yikes). For reference it has been 9 months that I’ve been wanting to put those shelves in. I could’ve had a whole baby. I took “before” photos of my room so I can show before and after but I feel like they don’t convey the ridiculous DEPTHS of the piles . I think they tweeted that they'll be up after AX :). Y’all ever plan to get a lot done on a certain day bc it’s gonna be a rainy day, wake up late feeling bad, it doesn’t rain at all, try to power through it but feel worse so u lay down then accidentally nap for 5 hours and now it’s 10 pm? . Hey hey this weeks episode is dorm competition but do you think we also get to The Fight .. I’m not ready to see that broken lil bakuface. Design team: this is good 
Focus group: (didn’t exist). AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA. LRT FOR SOME REASON I WAS LIKE “im not sure we’ll get to them” and didn’t realize OF COURSE WE WILL and now I’m excited..still holding out for big three but I think that’s a stretch Lol. NANA DO IT I WILL BUY I PROMISE. IDK WHY MY BRAIN DIDNT PROCESS THAT THIS PART WAS SO SOON. *grabby hands@deku + kiri for my ita bags*. @ DarkGreyClouds  @chriseatscandy  this is a good looking Denki I thought y’all should see. Hi I’m gonna out my mom for crying at last week’s episode... She was yelling to give Inko a job at the school because she would be lonely once her son moved out..... A mother’s perspective . SERIOUSLY Hopefully I’ll see it on my feed but if I don’t and forget to check pls@me I really wanna support u!! Kiri bag is small but I WILL MAKE ROOM. VERY TRUE... I just wanted a backpack but I wanted it CUTE!! I’m actually not doing too bad I’m just curating my merch a lot  it’s hard tho bc so many good kiris and good friends.. I’m glad I ordered more than a few extra copies of kiri zine bc people are asking A LOT.. I feel like I should’ve gotten even more but too late! Too risky for a not for profit project too.. I wouldn’t wanna be like I made the decision to spend extra and get stuck w books yknow. Omg. Also I hope y’all know that I don’t necessarily ship everything I ever like or RT but appreciate things can be sweet or cute even if you like another pairing.

There’s no need to be that fucking guy who comments “Cute but I hate this pairing/character.” Why would you do that. She usually doesn’t get as into it so I was surprised!! . For the millionth time this season — IM NOT READY. Mom: is anything in this chest of drawers?
Me, very proudly: nope, not a single thing!
Mom: .....
Me: nooOOOOOOO pic.twitter.com/WB27SBmJR6. YESSS TWO MORE KIRIS AND A NEJIRE WERE IN HERE. THESE ARE SO ODD?? BUT CUTE??? I've never seen this style of merch before. Weeps I saw someone recently who had cute art but was also selling buttons and stuff w kpop  logos and I was just like ??? Why do this ?? Esp when your art is cute u don’t need to boo.... made me super weary .  my long time friend got too touchy-feely last time and now he’s coming home again and idk what to do...I should’ve said something then but it was kinda just on the line and he was a bit drunk so I put it off but now I’m stressed . I..I’m wearing this dress for the first time and I realized it has a hole in it but it’s not so bad..then I just stretched too much and ripped a strap . \o/ pic.twitter.com/gX1dn2VQ6D. Quote love unquote?? I’ve read some good one shots but I can’t remember the titles or anything orz I’m bad at keeping track of fics.. I ONLY WATCHED IT A MONTH OR TWO AGO TOO ISNT IT SO GOOD. It’s been a while since I went through a lot of this stuff and while I’m still too sentimental holding on to things, I’ve progressed a bit to the point where I can think “I loved this in middle school” or “so+so who I haven’t talked to in 10 years have this to me)+still donate it. Aaaa I found this journal from high school! It’s really depressing honestly it was a really bad time but still very interesting. I found a spot where I crossed out some gay shit I wrote abt my friend since we had to turn these in to our teacher . I also wrote about the guy who introduced joey and I..I wish I could show him...he’ll be out of detox on the holiday..I hope I get to see him before he goes to an inpatient place.. !!   aaaa thank you for the support, jess! and for the recommendation! I definitely have to check that out..and my mom too LOL between the two of us and inheriting my grandma’s stuff this house is..a lot.. Slowly but surely tho! Omg THEYE LIKE ADORABLE PINTEREST POPSICLES   so precious. BOOOOOOOO
. So is now the time to make a pin of Kirishima’s clock like I’ve been wanting to for ages? It makes a cameo in my Dear Kiri zine piece too . I’m tryna not look at anime spoilers this week so I can 100% enjoy it when i watch it today!! THATS SO EXCITING ANDY!! LEMME KNOW IF U HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. Before/After!   Still a lot to do and I can’t put my cork board, house/cloud shelves, more beautiful art, etc up on the wall until after they put the A/C in  Still a lot to do in my room..and the house..but definitely a start! pic.twitter.com/KggmmGTN7h. Aaa I did get them from target but!! Different!   they’re so cute!! You should get another  pic.twitter.com/WuWLquEjix. I have soooo so much merch...Even if they’re cute I just have too much to know what to do with..Some were thrown at me by friends, some is merch people left on my table, bundles from zines I was in, etc. Advice on how to respectfully rehome these? Haha I got them last summer!! They were in the little dollar-y section at the fromt . I think two would look really cute! ; n; I think it feels weird to sell them...cause if someone wanted them then I’d be taking that sale away from the artist? And I also don’t wanna hurt the feelings of any friends I traded with by listing them up   there’s just...a lot of things. Definitely!! Also this whole pic is so cute ——the balloon decoration and kitty!!! damn..should've bought those big jump shop kiri buttons when I had the chance..if you come across them for sale please lemme know!! Small brain: I wanna focus on making some original art this summer to build my portfolio and for otakon
Galaxy brain: 4,000 bnha print ideas. HELP my bf was embarrassed abt rehab and his friend is asking me if he’s ok what do. I don’t wanna betray his trust - not that he asked me to not say anything - it’s just like ??? How else could I explain it? They’re good friends so it’s stupid. LMFAO I saw someone selling my rescue charm like damn I’ll buy it back it’s really popular . dSFHGSFG THANK U CITRA <3 --- Yes, they're up in my shop still - I'm waiting on my charm restock still - they've been really, really slow this time ; n; Should be coming any time now.. I FORGOT TO POST MY FUCKING KIRI ZINE PREVIEW AT ALL. (well, aside frmo that wip in like march). me: wow everyone's posting all at once I should wait---
(a month later)
me: OH FUDGE. Lest something goes awry, I should have everything - including that - at Flame!! . YELLIN! I never posted my preview for @kirishima_zine  
Shared a WIP long ago but here’s a crop from my finished piece! 

It was lovely working with so many artists I admire and meeting new ones too!   The project turned out beautifully, I can’t wait to share it w everyone!  pic.twitter.com/JDep8ThIvv. I just posted mine \o/ whatever!! \o/. me: mom can you help me - do you like his head like this or this?
mom: what's going on here?
me: (explains) .. some people ship them, but I don't real--
mom, incredibly dissmissively: oh no, I don't ship them

I had two hours of sleep last night. The results speak for themselves  pic.twitter.com/yLL0UDNgSK. Fuuuuccckk me this has never happened before..please...ugh pic.twitter.com/KeVu4CkTa6.

ULTIMATE ATTENTION HOG my dog literally just closed my sketchbook w her nose ?!?

Yikes..I'm so sorry they did you like that but I'm glad you're rid of them!! >:( You deserve better too..
Thank you for the support 
And don't worry- No one complained but I have posted a lot at the low points the past year or so and should prob make a private account orz. OH HECK YES BOO - one sec. heres' the main group for sharing your bags and asking for advice and stuff:  https://www. facebook.com/groups/itabags/   
and here's the sales group:  https://www. facebook.com/groups/itabags ales/   …. I just sold stuff on there a few days ago so def give it a go!! Jirou is really growing on me TT A TT <3. (INCOHERENT YELLING). For @sophiescribble1  's #sophiescribble5k  !! Congrats!!

This was the first #drawthisinyourstyle  challenge I ever saw and she's so cute I couldn't not draw her?? It was a really nice relaxing exercise actually.. pic.twitter.com/SjRBmWcbWk. current jam:  https://www. youtube.com/watch?v=cIriwV hRPVA   …. I haven't done of finished non-fan art drawing with LINES in a while?? So odd. I pulled that shit when dying my hair purple last spring... 
"Hmm the blonde is kinda nice..maybe I'll be blonde for a few weeks.." 
(8 months pass)
. i'm too stressed about tomorrow to sleep and also it's a good drawing night but its heading towards 4 and staying up this late is Bad. Alright I’m gonna try to sleep..tomorrow is gonna be a day. I love y’all, thank you for the support .. . Ohmygod 
Hawaiian rolls - Are you sure it wasn’t Emma stone who ate them? . (Muffled screaming). Omg this list kills me it’s such a mix of legitimate aliases/studio names of artists I follow and pure fucking memes. hypothetical (since I've had people ask me this though no one has followed thru thus far-) 
If someone commissions u to make smth u think would sell well - ie. charm/print of a popular series/character, what do you think would make it a fair exchange? like u're still spending time drawing a thing you wouldn't have drawn otherwise, but u'll make more $ from being allowed to sell the product to others? ITS CONFUSING... I was thinking maybe if u charge drawing fee + item + shipping the waive the latter 2?curious what y'all think. When do y’all think my charms (that should’ve been here Tuesday) will arrive? SCREAMS your table gets more and more intimidating . I hope soooooo!! It’s been sitting for three days tho :(. Well, I did the thing. Thanks for your support y’all..  We’ll see where things go from here..
So emotionally exhausted.. In other news, they allowed people to sit too close to the fireworks and ash and fire rained down on us. @ her_nerdiness  Thanks you two.  We’re still friends but it takes some pressure off for sure..We were starting to resent each other for not being able to give each other what we want/need rn+I didnt want it to end w one of us snapping..will deal with the rest when it comes. This!! It’s easy to see the parallels between Bakugou and Endeavor - some are so on the nose it’s obvious - but I think the point is that he WON’T grow up to be like that - that instead he’s changing and progressing even if it’s slowly...wow I love a boy. Why won’t they update my delivery date ., cursed ...gonna call customer service dnfnfjdndn this has never happened before I’m so —. Ok submitted the form asking what the heck the problem is.If I don’t receive a response I’ll call later when I’m  http:// awake.now    all  delivery options are grayed out, no delivery date, no update on package status,+best of all - no explanation as to why this is happening. Omg. Read this if u wanna wreck ur brain fbhffvbhfcvg this kinda stuff is so cool but a squicks me out hard  https:// twitter.com/i/moments/1014 720442043514886   …. Smdmdnnd GOOD LUCK LOWAH...it drives me crazy when places aren’t prepared for what they should KNOW is gonna be a crazy event... /looks@kinokuniya nyc’s Yuri on ice pop up. I believe in u... PLUS ULTRA! THis is so soft . OK CHARMS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE HERE TODAY BUT ILL BELIEVE IT WHEN I FUCKIN SEE IT---. CHARMS ARE HERE. HECK YEAH BUDDY!!!   I’m pumped! ...oh god now I gotta PACK THEM. Gdi for every one good thing two bad things happen. Sorry I uh my other good friend had a crisis so I didn’t get to pack any orders before the post office closed today but I’ll get as many as possible ready for the morning. I’m a little salty about the MHA movie at AX but probably not as salty as Japanese fans ... Mom: I’m getting hungry..Feeling like a snack
Me: Lookin’ like a snack
Mom: .....
Me: ........sorry. I’m trying not to spoil myself too much for once . (In reference to the movie). OK. SO.
> My orders
> Enamel Pins
> Store Update (Kiri Plush, UPDATE MY BANNER LOL)
> ????
> PROFIT ---
LOL no but > Dear Kiri Zine (when books arrive next week hopefully). also somewhere in here prep for Otakon...original prints??/charms??..lord help me. Ok!! batch of solo rescue charms done before dinner   more to follow ~ Tryna be speedy while keeping mess ups to a minimum . I’m also putting coupon codes in with older orders as a thank you for your patience   It’s not much but it’s something! I got about 1/4 of orders out;; Not too bad..
I'll try to get some more out tomorrow but I am going to see my friend who is visiting for only a few days from across the country and is having a bit of unexpected crisis too..orz
I hope to be 100% done before Sunday rolls around! Just kidding I’m a liar I did more like 40% of packages. That sounds and feels better. if you see this in time —- psst @64RinFaye  what would you like me to draw for your wonky bubble mailer doodle? . ..I never considered this but I do actively avoid her table now..wowee. Guh it’s finally not 90+ here after ..idk like 5 days?! ITS STILL WARM AND STICKY IN HERE but I’m gonna go outside and it will be GLORIOUS. All my mail is cursed. .................yikes ok. 56% done..Cady is dyin for a walk since she’s been stuck inside from the heat so gonna  drop these off and do that then try to fit a few more in before my friend arrives ! Gorgeous colors, so much feeling.. AAa it looks so good!! If you want it darker tho definitely do that because it'll get lighter and light with the sun/washing. aaa this looks so fun and relaxing!! ; u;. OH...FUCk.......I FORGOT TO ORDER FROM U ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, these turned out so cute TT A TT. Fuck this is bad. I’m ok. My friend is not. When it rains it pours.. Ah my friend and I talked for like 5+ hours ..He seemed to feel a lot better at least so that’s good bc he scared me on the phone ...I’m about at my limit tho zzzzz. His mom also gave me another giant bag of clothes   I still didn’t finish the last one she gave me. Beep bop please recharge my battery. Ehh I think someone was saying earlier that the movie wasn’t really canon so kiribaku shippers should calm down its like please relax and let people enjoy things? If you’re firmly of the opinion then it shouldn’t matter to you / bother you anyways?? Zzzzz. /pats you gotta use stuff like yahoo auctions japan it’s way cheaper..I mean there are fees and international shipping but if you buy multiple things or split the order w friends it is very worth it...like I saw someone selling 4 omanjuu for the price of 1 here and cried. /glances at deku bag w like two pieces of official merch 

I feel ya bud.... Hsbshsbah I got worked up and couldn’t fall back asleep so now I’ve had five hours of sleep again..how do y’all function on this little sleep? I’ve always been the type who needs 7+. Ahh I see .. maybe the bigger problem is I’m not a coffee/tea person . WOW THAT ARRIVED QUICKLY!! hdjjsndjd   Thank you so much for your support korinne - both w the shop and w my emotional tweets lately . Aaa yeah I hate drawing digitally during the day so that’s relatable! It’s hard when you get on a roll haha. Hdbdjd im always tempted to close my store for a break but never do. Wow it didn’t even occur to me that they /weren’t/ actually orange?? they should be. There’s this group of peeps that go really fast on their boat and tow people on skis (idk the word..) on our pond all the time. How do I befriend them   I don’t wanna ski - that sounds scary - they just seem like they have fun and go outside a lot. Now I wanna make pretty donuts
The problem w me and baking is I don’t wanna eat it bc I’m too picky I just wanna bake it . I am guesstimating dear kiri zines will arrive here Thursday..but I have no proof of this so I’m not putting it on the zine twitter lol. This dream is..The Dream. No matter what image reference you look for if you aren’t careful w wording you’re gonna get some nsfw shit like damn I wanted girls hanging out together, eating ice cream not girls licking one melted ice cream and each other’s tongues while making eye contact w the viewer. me: it's like..they're on skis...in the water..
you: water skiing?
me: Ahh, yes yes yes--
. I MISSED THIS EARLIER--- omg I do the same thing!!..friend ;). asfseaf IF I MISS SMTH U @'d me with it's bc 90% of my mentions aren't showing up on mobile!! only on the desktop!! anyone else have this problem? WE WERE FOOLED IT WAS REALLY HOT AND STICKY YESTERDAY AFTERNOON..or at least here. Today was GREAT tho! I JUST WANNA HUG THEM ALL. GOGOGOGOGO!! omg...in general tho that sounds like it could get messy.. (crawls out of grave) 72% done w orders. ot*kon's fan v original art rules are so scary ...IM GONNA TRY TO MAKE NEW ORIGINAL STUFF BUT JESUS IM SO SCARED LMFAOO. I haven't been before so if someone wants to tell me more about how it is to be in the AA/w those rules that'd be comforting TT A TT ((anxiety intensifies)). so they can charge asinine amounts of money for people who wanna/can pay (> $1000). ?! wait new this year or were they new last year? . Interesting! I still wanna be prepared / fair tho. eirsdgdfsg i'm tryna make matching kiribaku/tododeku merch but it's the deadline and also the last day to see my ex before he (hopefully) checks into inpatient tomorrow so...SEND ME GOOD VIBES. Also send me good vibes bc archery is smth I haven’t done since I was 8. I remember being good at it ..and I’m good at it on wii but —- . Lmfao tell her the UA girls disagree. Hahahah new screen shot folder on your phone called “proof”. I’m about as bad at archery as I imagined
I started doing well about 3/4 of the way in but then the guys working there started talking about anime and I was distracted . I hope they feel like shit every time they look at his adorable little face   I’m sorry people are shitty Jenny..theft has been up so much lately in AA... C...can I bother you for which artist was the Big 3 button? :O. I thought I escaped hurting my drawing arm but the bow arm hurts way more..my mom taped ice packs to my arm ; n;. Thank you so much!! <3. IT LOOKS VERYVERYGOODDd. ?!! Which raises the question - why did they want that seat so badly . $99 for that?....to each his own . plus ultra!! go /beyond stupid/ . Can’t extend my arm, pinky is numb. I am not made for sport. I asked for a quote but received just the word sorry in response . I’m screaming how am I supposed to put charms together with my arm like this fuuuuuucckkkkkk
Ibuprofen helps a lot but I should still not probably do smth that normally makes it hurtvvvvv. I have the same question . Everyone + The Internet: The only real cure is resting it
Me: (looking at remaining orders and art deadlines) .........did u say numb the pain and keep using it. As time goes on more parts start to hurt..upper arm, then forearm, then thumb and palm, then pinky??, now my rotator cuff too 
I really hecked up. I just keep thinking about when I broke my arm a few years ago - it was a Friday night and I had to wait til Monday to get a cast and that was ridiculous?! zines should be shipping to me today..
/stares at inbox. omg I DIDN'T NOTICE THAT --- GENIUS!!!!!! AA CONGRATS!!! you've gotta be pretty stupid to keep doing the same thing and not expect people to catch on but I hope to heck they are stupid and get their asses CAUGHT. yELL. Absolutely fucking disgraceful  https:// twitter.com/i/moments/1016 374997722550276   ….  thank YOU!! I’m glad it arrived safely! At Chinese restaurants I break the chicken fingers in half, pull out the chicken (and eat it), then stuff the breading w rice and eat it . I also like my Frosted Flakes w banana  in it but and no milk (not as weird maybe). Aaa thank you so much for the support!  I’m glad they arrived safely u vu. Ack, they shipped Fedex..didn't they used to use UPS? Fedex can get wrecked - they lost my 2-day packages for 60+ days one time and I am still holding that against them LOL It just showed up 2 months later having been ripped open+repacked in a giant box, no note or sorry. I'm actually able to draw without much pain today as long as I keep my grip loose and the gestures small - which works for tablet drawing! Just gotta not overdo it. pic.twitter.com/4CBNjoOx0M. Thank you!! <3.  mwuahaha i knew you'd like it~~ I just finished but I'm gonna try to make a matching kiribaku one before posting! ...yikes. My mom is like a fucking genius bc she was like WAIT ISNT FREE! COMING BACK OUT and reminded me I made a circular print back in the day that I could put on fans too   (I’d love to make a new one but no time..probably). Tododeku is so pure..I can’t summon the same amount of passion for it as kiribaku tho - I think I just like rowdy boys u nu A type. I love this more than words. My arm is still pretty messed up - I can’t straighten it without pain+shaking. I was able to draw bc I could loosely grip my pen but putting charms together is way more painful. My momma is too good to me and said she’ll help so I can get at least some orders out today if not all. Got this cutie from @MaizuruBay !! I love him.. Please check out their work! They have cute fan-made manjuu of bnha, voltron, haikyuu, and more! pic.twitter.com/VRTSLoU8GE. (Softly) will u have these at ota .... . I was trying to watch my walllet but I may be back for Deku . ORSGJTHMTDYGOD. She is..Well she knows how much I've been stressing about getting these last orders out and I had to wait til yesterday for some parts but I hurt myself Sunday;; u nu. (Mutuals Only Please!) ARTIST ALLEY FRIENDS 
Very last minute - I missed ordering w my friend bc of injury, so I plan to place a plastic stick fan order Thurs night. If you have a design ready to go/can make one by then and are interested, I can provide more details in DMs . cool! I'm writing up info now i'll dm you. I’m so nervous for ota..but excited..but nervous. Me. Djdjjdsj merch life is so hard . 85% of orders done /lays down My arm hurts and I gotta see my friend before he leaves so the rest tonight or tomorrow! I did more against my better judgement so now there’s few left aaa I’ll be so relieved when I’m done!!....and then zines arrive Friday and I’m dead again LOOOL. Shdjjdsjsh We did 750 for Born to make History round 1, I did 400 alone for another zine. This’ll be about 300 and with a friend! But yeah my personal store orders take longer cause it’s random combos of items and I do package doodles on most!  i suffer for my art in more ways than one . A random artist just emailed me asking to split my three feet of table space..buddy...please... It killed me bc he started it off like he was gonna offer me an opportunity . Should I make a fan of this (like a plastic stick-style hand fan)? Pool in replies.. I’m crying bc it autocorrected to pool instead of poll I’m gonna leave it pic.twitter.com/LypWnG0avF. See OP. I don’t have time to draw smth new of them and I haven’t seen starting days or the other film I don’t even know the title of bc I’m a damn disgrace and I gotta before s3..which airs tomorrow (oops). Thank you again!! I’m glad I finally drew them all so you could finish your collection!  PS I adore how you’re so dedicated you buy even the uh..less beautiful of the official merch that’s out there . Fun fact: these were the first charms I ever made!!!! so..I hear you may have a Kirishima I don’t own.. (Slides u currency). “WHO GAVE THIS CAT A GUN”. Not that anyone asked but mine are 13 (omg) and Sir..idk why he looks very silly to me . Yay!! The zines already made it to Connecticut! Maybe they’ll even arrive tomorrow...I’m probably getting too excited, it says Friday. If this is true ... IM NOT READY BUT ALSO PLEASE. Yeah..I just feel bad that it’s like 3 year old art I sold on other types of merch before :(. DJDJDNDNDNSJSJ (screaming). this week’s chapter is gonna be a fucking ride... It Dabi appears on the last page and we gotta wait another week I’ll also combust LMFAO. GUHH NOOO MISTY....I’m sorry, I hope it gets better quickly !! I wanna watch free but I missed the movies so I gotta do that first. Y’all the white bubble mailers are $7 less than black bubble mailers but sometimes they are a bit see-through... OH I FOUND RED ONES FOR CHEAPER ??? They’re so cute? wtf ok problem Solved. update: they're slightly smaller in one dimension!! NEW PROBLEM LMFAOOO. Since I have so many already most of y'all will get boring white ones gomen. Patting myself on the back for organizing the zine labels in batches before the books arrive. update: Shi*pstation is stupid and only allows you 5 open batches at a time /hard eye roll. OK! Grouped and double-checked for labels all zine orders except participants, giveaway, and squishies! will finish organizing them tomorrow. looking into domains and .moe is an option im crying. LMFAOOO pic.twitter.com/dHQrpu9qLC. tfw not sure if call out or nudes pic.twitter.com/0c4Kxrn1NF. i want it..but i shouldn't..but i want it. ((HYPOTHETICAL)) domain help!!
 cambrasine  (dot) 

options in polls + .....like this post for .moe LMFAO. Beautiful animation, beautiful song
 https://www. youtube.com/watch?v=12rivC CvE1g   …. bakugou is giving me so much trouble rn (drawing)...have a nice face u little shit. don't me mind just chilling here crying, listening to vance joy, reading bnha spoilers@3:30 AM. HOLY FUCK. Over the past 36 hours the zine package has hit three check points in CT. CONNECTICUT ISNT THAT BIG I feel like they’re moving it slowly on purpose . I tried to draw MakoHaru but they’re not really recognizable in my style..I’ve never been good at drawing them . It moved 15 minutes closer then 20 minutes back away I’m crying pic.twitter.com/CT5L2WlvyH. The pay your age day at build a bear was a cute idea but it makes me kinda sad bc like..idk shit like that is cool everyone loves a deal but it’s the only way poorer families could access it at all and you know not everyone in that line is too poor to pay full price (sigh). I will tryyyyyyy to fix youuuu. LRT I’ll never be a fan of him and was not super stoked for this arc but I do think it is interesting to see the public perception and good hero work he does vs his family life.. And to see how complex it is..that even w the abuse Shouto was still relieved..yknow..idk... Idk like there are times u gotta step back and assess it. We’ve been various degrees of poor when I was younger (like literally going to a food bank to spending our last $ one toilet paper) but there were still times then when we acknowledged that someone else needed it more. It’s Coldplay y’all chill . Pro tip: Put a wet paper towel on your face and sit in front of the fan 

(In all seriousness tho yikes :( I hope you recover quickly!”. I recommend making eyes/breathing holes btw   An important detail!! Hope it helps <3. Since I direct most of my traffic to my storefront it doesn’t make sense financially to have my own shop but storenvy could always change their fee policies, charges my customers extra $ for themselves, etc. so I think maybe I should switch.. It’s more customizable too, and if I start from scratch and combine it w my portfolio site for cons it’ll feel like I’m getting more bang for my buck.. Tfw the zines haven’t arrived yet but the bubble mailers did and you wanna post SOMETHING https:// twitter.com/kirishima_zine /status/1017557916277182464   …. hmm..If I make and print the labels now I can start sticking them on mailers but I have to pick a mailing date..I could set it for Saturday but if for some god forsaken reason the zines DON'T arrive tomorrow then I'll have people emailing me like ITS NOT SHOWING UP. YIKES yeah Anyone who's saying he's redeemed is.yikes. but I think the OP was more aimed at people who were saying anyone who likes Endeavor is a terrible person or smth.
Yeah! Obviously his feelings would be more complex than 'fuck u dad' I just hope it's handled tastefully! <3. LRT there are so many important moments in BNHA that I forget about..this is one of them. * U* They came out so cute!
Also we are now terrible-cut-lines-on-our-mew-mew-charms bros . oh no my favorite podcast did an episode on amazon  and I'm Scared. Holy crap. Omg I literally had just woken up from a dream where the zines came and were all screwed up (wrong size, wrong paper, some had the cover of my last project, weird stamping+numbering, etc) and the guy was ACTUALLY delivering the ACTUAL books which look PERFECT!!! . learning curve w sh*pstation is a nightmare. apparently santander doesn't think it's my prerogative to purchase $160 of postage at 1:30 AM and they also don't want to help me unless it's between the hours of 6 AM - 10 PM. so yeah, no labels tonight. They made me put in my language, what I needed help w, SS #, pin, reset my pin (it wanted me to?!), and savings account number --- only to be told call back between 6 and 10 TT A TT /lays down
I'm glad you were able to resolve yours tho!!  Dear Kiri Packing Progress!  
Here's tonight's tally for those following along at home. 
Thanks to @grimmfirefly  's assistance! <3 

LABELED
3 (s/o to my shitty bank)

PACKED
Single Zine-Only: 82
Single Bundle: 40
Single Deluxe (No Tape): 31. I am On Hold. The shit I do for Kirishima Eijirou. @ single zine only folks please enjoy your shipping label which says Daer Kiri bc I set it up at 2 AM and it cannot be edited retroactively . Omg. All of OK GO’s videos are pretty amazing! They do all sorts of crazy strictly choreographed/timed stuff including but not limited to on segways (I Won’t Let You Down), WITH DOGS (White Knuckles), in zero gravity (Upside Down & Inside Out), etc. They have making of videos too. can't believe it's coming to this TT A TT ...... tfw you're really busy but its a charity project so you sacrifice your time cutting down labels to save $ instead of buying new damn labels TT A TT. Most of my bathing suits are too small (wump wamp) and there are now Two one piece swim suits I'm eyeing but I will never wear them and I know it ..bc one pieces. RIGHT It starts to feel really personal........like thanks for liking my art enough to risk it but no thanks for not giving a fuck about another human being. ok can someone explain banana fish to me and whether or not I should be watching it
Suddenly a lot of artists I follow are posting about it but when I tried to look it up I got SUPER CONFUSED bc it seems dark but the genre said SHOUJO help. LRT THIs is so fucking sad?? THat's MOST OF HIS LIFE...like ....tha'ts most of his life..that's so  long..how the fuck. ohh shipstation tells you when they've opened their tracking email..that's pretty damn rad. Huh. Thank you for the info!! It certainly sounds interesting..I have no idea if I’ll enjoy it or not but perhaps I should give it a try . sh*pstation, while not intuitive at all, is proving itself to be far superior......either that or I have no idea how to use sh*ppingeasy to its fullest potential but I think it's the former. Ohh!! Thanks for the warning, Andy! I'm a bit generally sensitive(more to psychological horror stuff than physical I think? [esp. in animation]), but I don't really have triggers for those things so I think I'll be ok! \o/ I'll give it a shot when I have the time~. Ahh yeah I saw about that in the synopsis which is why I was like "??? this is??? shoujo???????????" Good to know what's coming! I can alway stop if it's too much ; u;.

FOR SOME REASON I thought Deku and Bakugou's fight was right after they moved into the dorms and I'm cryin guys I've been waiting for that fight and it's not gonna happen for a while!! It's such an important fight I wanna see it right now.....poor bby boy makes such anguished faces....THERES GONNA BE SO MANY MORE EPS BEFORE THEN..it may even finish out the season at this rate../lays down. I THOUGHT I ONLY HAD TWO FREE! MOVIES TO WATCH BUT ONE WAS A TRILOGY OF MOVIES??? I'm never gonna be able to watch s3. Yessss .. It's gonna be so powerful animated.. I'm not ready (but also I WANT IT NOWWWW). Yeah!! I was?? So sure it happened immediately? D: I'm so impatient!!! bnha manga spoilers/////

I looked it up and I guess it's after the provisional license exam,...makes sense since he'll be EXTRA UPSET after but dang I was 1000% sure it was sooner! Ohhh!! THIS IS VALUABLE INFO! I definitely have to watch starting days though.. lrt I made this as clear as possible so I will literally cry if/when I get an e-mail thats like "hi I ordered 4000 deluxe bundles wheres my tracking number?????," sent from an e-mail address associated with no orders, with name or order#attached. This is me so bad that I literally bought a second tablet pen...and then guess the fuck what - I lost it so I’m back to one. I had to practically drag Cady across the lawn bc it’s freakin 85 and she wants to fry herself in the sun like a lil idiot. Audio: me fawning over my own under construction website pic.twitter.com/X7JhktgTns. My storenvy has like hundreds of old hidden products..even tho it’s a pain to move im excited to start fresh. Just dropped off the single US zine onlys bc I couldn’t make a scan form for them...I’m so sorry@local USPS workers. W/e do it screw their negativity !! They went out of their way to be mean? Lmfao I may have left my glasses at ihop so I called and described them and he was like “we have.. A LOT of glasses..” . Omg guys w the new shop I can make a freaking BIRTHDAY CLUB that’s so fun ok putting this on the back burner for packages + ota prep. dgdrhdfg In the sun it is!! (stares into the abyss) I may..bring back old designs to help meet ot*kon 50/50 quota. having to send charm orders in three weeks in advance now instead of 2..this kills the man. Friendly reminder to everyone to put in their Otakon orders ASAP bc turnaround times are crappy now / during con season ; n; https:// twitter.com/cambrasine/sta tus/1018722217864105985   …. I changed my twitter name to reflect how overwhelmed I am
They are demolishing our kitchen tomorrow and my brother will be home in a week and freak if the house isn't perfect  - spoiler alert: it's a disaster. TT A TT THAnk you. Last time it took several days to get outlines instead a few hours, and it took 3 weeks to arrive instead of the usual 1.5-2 :( I think they are just very overwhelmed bc 1. it’s convention season and 2. people spread the word a lot so they’re more popular.. I’ve also seen more people having issues with getting other people’s charms and the time before they forgot one of my designs :(.  I AM SORRY TO HEAR THAT THIS IS RELATABLE,..we’ll get thru it... On top of everything else I am PMSing very hard my body Hurts...this timing means I’ll probably get it during my cons next month too  please...I wanna live..and wear bodysuit cosplays . /CHOKE oHmygod
Do you happen to know the artist who made this? AWHIDF I GRABBED THE BLADE OF MY PAPER CUTTER REAL QUICK luckily it only cut my skin but jesus that was close ... don't be like me, pack your zines not at 3:30 AM. me w the zines: careful

 zz goodnight this is so chiilll. The guy said he’d be here 9:30 to 10:00 meanwhile it’s 9:10 and he’s been hammering for several minutes I am so tired fuck. omg i did the same math like 5 times and keep getting different answers is this why people sleep more than three hours. I actually recognized the others in the set - I think it’s @wwileyy  ! . I need this nonsense for my ita bag. imported artists and emailed the few i'm missisniggdfgdfgh /,...so little sleep, easily distracted. Me: ok!! Get off the computer!! Pack some zines!!!

Haha. @ pukaparade. uh I'm not 100% on this bc it's a bit outta my circle but please tell me theres more to why people (men) are upset about she-ra than she has .shorts?! -squints-. that's not AnY bETTEr than the shorts thing asdfghsFDGHL god. ugh!! yeah I saw that post   wow. tragic. . ohH!!! Thank you Claire!!!   I'm glad it reached you safely~~. poor cade is so anxious from the past few days (moving stuff around - which often signifies us leaving - plus THE NOISE from kitchen demo today) so she is VERY CUDDLY but like..TOO CUDDLY??

Djfndjdn frustrated w myself for putting off my enamel pins so long that they wouldn’t come in time for ota :( got distracted...very much next on my to do list... /SHAKES LANDON 
OR YOURE ABOUT TO U LITTLE——. ITS SO STORMY wtfff It was so sunny but I laid in bed bc pain and now it's dismal..well... good day to PACK zines..not sure if they'll make it out before tomorrow tho : (. LRT ITS SO PRETTY what the heck I want it for aesthetics LMFAO. ohymgod is this even real life. lrt if you ever underestimate the bullshit artists face well then do i have a story for you-. LMFAOOO OHHH NOOO For the first time ever bought a piece of art in a gallery when we were on vaycay (Happy birthday to me..) and the artist wrote to me like hey thank u but um also I didn't expect it to sell so quickly I didn't get to photograph it so could you--- LOL. //vibrates I wanna post fans but should wait for mock ups...
sh,,ould. Oh no!! It must be up the coastline cause that’s how mine looks too...yikes...I’ll be sure to put tape over the address labels from now on . w*x typically has sales like every other week but now that i'm making my website they just keep sending me random emails that aren't that u nu. omg..luckily most are still in their original double boxes but the two little packs of zines i had out already...they're warped...humidity?! I haven't self-assembled any zines yet but damn this is a pro tip right here! I didn't know that was an option :O.  !! Thank you so much!! I adore your work so that means a lot! also no pressure but I'd be down to trade instead if that was something you're interested in~. Aaa well I love risograph printing and I have a little zine collection goin but it's up to you~~   Whatever you prefer~. Sure sure! c: wanna move to DMs? IM LAUGHINGM Y fuckkcing 
I told my mom that I think the fan handles may have a hole at the bottom that you could loop charms onto and she quietly said, "Wow," in the most genuinely blow-away way and paused to bask in it and i'm fdgdg. [RT] Uchiwa/Plastic hand fan feat. bfs + festival food! 
Matches a certain set of charms wink wonk  

Preorder@ http:// cambrasine.storenvy.com      First 5 orders get $2 off+surprise bonus! Should have@Otakon too~

(Promo img in replies..they're so pretty I wanted to post like this) pic.twitter.com/aZAj0kCCgC. Y’all ever do the thing where you feel slightly sick but not SO bad so you keep doing stuff and then you feel worse and you’re like whoops. First 5 discount/bonus is gone! Thank you!! Guh seeing the stupid storenvy fee on your orders is driving me crazy now .. I will have it sorted soon  I’d move to tictail but it seems pointless when I have my site almost set up orz. ohmYGOD.  aa thank you!! I love drawing festival things!! I wanna go to one when I eventually go to japan . I’ve seen some videos of people smashing their cracked pieces which looks like good stress relief   I could never do that to my work but it seems fun. Y’all w*x has had a sale almost every week for the past several months but I stared building after their last sale and SUDDENLY THREE WEEKS W NO SALES this is madness. Omg that’s not a bad idea . uguuu I got a bad migraine I couldn't sleep off so in the morning I took the medicine that's been making me feel a different kind of bad lately then had nightmares about plane crashes and shootings..I just wanna relax today..maybe watch Free! Starting Days or smth ; n; /pats self. I also like maybe cried in public at a restaurant last night idk i'm just??? melancholy????? Also -- They will have a small heart shaped hole at the bottom of the handle which is 1. just adorable and 2. you could hang charms off it (slides u matsuri charm listing) or use it to hook it onto smth like your (ita bag!!). have a very weird but good song that's stuck in my head

Edit: Updated mock-up! pic.twitter.com/O8Z4Nz0AjK. TT A TT Please help me find this artist? IT'S SO CUTE I need him... pic.twitter.com/lg1e8V4j9y. Aaa I need an idea! Flame con has like a scavenger hunt kind of thing so I can make people come to my table for a quest!! I have!! No ideas!! !! Thank you . omg me naive self thought we could do most of the rest tonight..meanwhile my mom even helped me and yet we're only halfway thru the ones I PRINTED (1/3 of the remaining) we've been at it a while and my arms hurt rippy. LRT taking forever bc I can’t in good conscience send some of this shit w/o bubble wrap  I haven’t had a problem w previous zines but this one has me nervous? Hopefully the#of damaged items will be low.. Better to do it right the first time than waste time+money screwing it up. Those three are most popular, Kirishima is my fave, Tsuyu, Tokoyami, and All Might are also very popular!! A couple of the villains also have a good following but you won’t know them yet since you’re just starting . You ever think about random  shit from your youth and with your adult perspective suddenly realize “oh, that was kinda fucked up”. @CCCrystalify draws a lot of this!! amiami points make me feel like I got a discount when it was actually like 30 cents LMFAO. I fell a bit behind on my store orders trying to get these zines out.. u nu I'm sorry, I'll try to multitask better. lrt sky puppy. I slept from 4 AM to 7 AM@u@I sure do love insomnia and work on the house. @ pukaparade. always dropping mad $$ on straps for matsuri charms LMFAO. 10000% TRUE FACT. oh fuck they were messing w the electricity and turned off the ..fridge. out of ...all the appliances. ; n; That person found the kiri button I want but it's in an ebay shop.. Some artists do sell on there but this one has a lot of random stuff/different artists and I feel like the likelihood of it being permitted for sale by them is. low. i'm crying one of the guys working is super sick pls go home and rest bc u should and also  I cannot get sick before ota thnak u bYE sjgirdkghf TT A TT. /me rambling in ignorance of the details of japanese censorship laws
I remember YoI didn't show the kiss because of them but some other shows (like Banana Fish.. I saw a spoiler) have more intense ones? Is it bc that show is more mature material and probably on at a later hour? Djfndjdn YIKES same here actually except we weren’t sure if he was a real person or she just made him up. Help which watch first. Welcome to the fandom . TT A TT So cute and colorful..I can't wait to get my hands on more!! My mom has really good instincts about men. Either that or most men are bad. ..............Maybe both. . Psst @Wix  , happen to know if any of those sales are coming up? ;3 c 
I feel like they were happening several times a month..until I actually got to a good point with my site building . yes I just tweeted@w*x I am that thirsty. This ANON objectively fucking sucks  

I hope everyone’s positivity in the replies is able to inspire you again because we all look forward to seeing what you create!  

PS On a side note yes some people (not you!!) are unskilled but: art is SUBJECTIVE /rolls away. I’m cRYING. Ok the night before I got 3 hours of sleep so I went to bed early and slept 6.5 hours and now I’m ??? I’ve been up for an hour and a half..Like should I try to sleep a bit more that’s good but not great?? But what if I feel worse when I wake up again?? Hnn. Ah that’s disappointing...yeah cause they kissed in No.6 too !! And ...show that I don’t remember the name of cause I didn’t watch it. I just remember at the time that was the reason people were saying but guess not! Thank you for the info . Happy belated birthday! enjoy!! LRT all this pizza shop au content is so good. LRT HOLY SHIT SHUGO CHARA CROSS OVER??? I fucking love this. I WANNA DRAW IT BUT NO TIME. i'm yelling this guy is Not Getting how I want the free fan laid out he just sent me one with Haru's face half obscured by the handle TT A TT please..sir...I sent you...a visual already. It's holding things up cause he sends me the mock up@like 4 so there's not time to fix it til the next day when he sends me another late in the day + it's still not right + it REPEATS igh tdf :'(  I would've just said fuck it and approved but a face is covered this time.. They didn't have a template for some reason so I hand to just make it;; I just tried to change the back side but then they changed both sides to the back, so I corrected them, they changed it to the right sides but one is rotated slightly so the face is obscured LMFAO so close. I hope so :') I couldn't have been too much clearer with words and visuals.. Yeah orz I just??? like I literally just sent you - in your mock-up style - what I wanted ?? how did u send me back smth different . I saw someone making card captor Sakura merch w back cards that were clow cards and people voted that they’d keep them but generally I think unless it really adds something like that that people will toss em. Both these chicks and the chick that worked here were so cute I felt personally attacked pic.twitter.com/yr5jQYQ8OJ. I'm glad it arrived safely!!   Everyone worked so hard to make beautiful Kiris TT u TT. ohymgod you made the earphone wraps...now i just need...earphones LOOL. FDSOJGDFHO I JUST SAW THE DROPDOWN MENU OPTions on the earphone wraps I'm crying I'm glad I'm not the only one who pulls that shit . I feel like this support person answered the question they wanted me to ask and not the one I did.... UH OH IM GONNA START THIS SOON NOW IM SCARED. Zzzzz I’m so sleepy today. Postal worker: wow, you’re busy lately!
Me, sobbing: haha yeah. Mdndjdjd Eating outside and Cady jumped up on the garden bed for a better vantage point to eye my food . Y i k e s. Hello friends!! Please help me identify this bird?! I’m having a lot of trouble..
He was hanging out cuddled up to our house for hours yesterday but was gone when we got back from buying him seed. Today he’s lurking around injured I think..he can’t seem to fly very well pic.twitter.com/gj769cfBKe. Aaa ok!! He was just huddled like right on my porch for several hours yesterday and seemed unwilling to fly away even when he was scared (I dropped smth, my dog was near, etc.) He flies a little but not great so thought he may b injured but a baby makes sense! Thank you so much!! WOW YOU ARE 1000% right!! So he is a baby!! I think I may have seen Mom around so! Phew! I’m glad he’s probably ok then, just got nervous cause the behavior seemed unusual. Thank you so much! I don't..understand why people would put a white stroke/outline around their design then print it on clear acrylic?   To each their own, but it's cheaper to print on white so if you want that look I just..think that makes more sense? I consider it, but I would like to consider it MORE - like some people utilize the material / transparency / foil really well!! Ohh!! Yeah, I think it makes sense for yours!! It was just the past few days I saw a few that were REALLY THICC AND CHUNKY and pretty much to the edge of the acrylic and I was like '...huh' 
Clear acrylic is really nice....Frosted is cool too but expensive > n<. help me figure out how to get the w*x algorithm to email me another 50% sale?! so weird- I have 2 accounts - on 1 they offered it almost every week for 6+ months UNTIL I was ready+now aren't. On the other they stopped offering after I didn't log in for a while (april). algorithms SUCK. I just sent them a screen shot of how they've emailed me this offer every week for the past 8 months, quite literally up until I decided to go for it LMFAO IM FEELIN SO DONE RN. They should . When will people rediscover NO.6 please. I’m glad it finally made it to you   Thank you again!! I WAS AGONOZING Over how to pack the bundles w squishies and anyway i solved it like a boss. ITS GONNA LOOK RIDICULOUS THE WAY I PACKED IT BUT PLEASE BEAR WITH ME LMFAOO Hopefully the way I packed it will prevent the zine from getting bent even with the fat squishy but lemme know if there were any issues! dgidfhtrdh I've watched it three times but I feel like I need to go again.. ohmyogd I REMEMBER I was listening to the OP and my brother was like why are you listening to this you can't even understand the words and I was like I LIKE THE MUSIC and he was like what music and I was SO OFFENDED. Grrrrr I’ve been so sleepy all day 
I did some things but not as much as I wanted and now it’s s reasonable time to sleep but I wanna do more but I’m sleepy
Also I haven’t watched bnha yet :(. pic.twitter.com/VjAfnP24Xm. It only gets more justified w time. They kiss   twice!!!!! I wanted to draw tonight but had to do zines and clean instead...doodled some girls tho pic.twitter.com/zxS3an2Tmq. Could u spare a moment for our lord and savior Kirishima Eijirou. Just gave my dog a thumbs up like she would possibly know what I meant. Omg I have this for my bunny!! pic.twitter.com/I8YpwJIajX. lrt NOOO THERES EVEN MORE DESIGNS NOW??/ someone buy me like half of these fuck. 4 minutes into banana fish, episode 1
me: ?!??????? ??
?????????????????/........ I love my brother but djdjjd I’m so nauseous I don’t wanna go into Boston rn. Our battery died on the way back from the airport . Uhhhhhhhh it’s gonna be a whole hour before the tow truck is here and they can only take one person cool cool cool. pic.twitter.com/mZhfVIBqsZ. Home Bnbcxxvmm. LRT I love and also hate this. Yikes... how people who know half the story go around saying what’s wrong or right is so ????

And even if there wasn’t any substance who gives a crap let people draw what they want! 

I bet anyone who gave u shit will be drooling all over your art soon just give em a week . Ugh definitely!! They don’t deserve your time   instead use your time to draw more things that’ll piss them off ahaha  . @ Panel 4...same, Abel,..same . Anyway thanks for this tweet bc it made me realize I didn’t have enough sleep

Before I understood I was like “huh idk but I’d be more concerned that it’s called Potato Street” . /lays down I haven't heard back from joey 
I wonder if they're on one of their multiple-day backpacking/camping expeditions..I hope my letter got delivered alright if not;;. OHMygodndnd at least twice a year my mom leaves chocolate in her purse, it melts and destroys everything   at least she’s consistent. Two damages so far...it's not like a bent corner it's like they're both like REAL BAD - one looks like it was stabbed and the other looks like the spine was karate chopped in half    USPS what are y'all doin .. Apparently   We mailed out 3x the number of zines the same way before and had like 5 damages so hopefully it'll be ok.. Banana Fish Ep 2 Spoiler ///

I do not wanna do packages rn and I don’t wanna have to hold 20 charms I could’ve sold at Ota but also like it’s so pretty I wanna show everyone. I've got leftovers zines+zine merch from 2015/16 and dozens of Kiri plush ... TOO LATE WE ARE ALREADY LIKE EACH OTHER. mood. IM NOT TYPICALLY A YELLING AT THE SCREEN TYP EBUT BANANA FISH---. yoikes. This is the best summary I've seen. PSsst if you wrote to me about Kiri plush last month please poke me !! I'm trying to find all of y'all across the different platforms but I'm afraid I'll miss one r two. I'm getting ready to put them back in my shop but I set a few aside for people I had talked to~~. Happens to the best of us /pat. Bakugou as Spider-Gwen ? Things I didn’t know I needed . You ever read a fic but know Way Too Much so you’re distracted by inaccuracies. Me, pushing my glasses up: actually, Kirishima dyed his hair AFTER the entrance exam as evidenced by—. Torn between opening new shop now or after ota/flame... now means packages NOW or saying they’ll be mailed by the end of the month instead to avoid limiting stock for cons..since ota is big..halp

Waiting avoids dilemma, but I’m impatient..and curious if new system is good or not. this place sounds Lit. There was a resurgence recently!! Go for it! . guhhh I finally fixed my photoshop brush lag problem but i had to reset all my preferences >  n< no thanks. Wheeze I have a physical tomorrow..they’re gonna try to take my blood and ask me why I don’t see a therapist wumpwamp. Haha..if I..didn’t get an anime nyc e-mail that probably means it’s a rejection, right? . Ok they said they'll all be out by tomorrow - Rejections included. So...SEND ME GOOD ANIME NYC VIBES Y'ALL ... I REALLY WANNA GO BACK!! Should I live tweet the more anxious I get every minute I don’t get an animen*c email . I did this and cracked the wooden frame .. it was a really nice board I wanted it in my room during off-time. I have a feeling I’ll wake up to bad news u nu  I hate wave acceptances, way more anxiety. OH NO... Oh no I want them . Aaa good luck to us both!! ?!?!I’ll fucking fight them???

For real though I’m so sorry that happened..Did you talk to con staff about it?

I haven’t encountered this..My booth is so pastel most guys’ eyes glaze over and they pass..one guy did kiss my hand tho . Ugh! Not a good way to start the day . Ohh my charms will be here tomorrow which is cool (it was quicker than usual even tho last time took way longer?! I could’ve made more..) but I thought they were fans first so I got more excited aaa. I started a list for anime bingo and ITS ALL OVER THE PLACE. Magical girl sports action ??? . I had to cut Orange and I'm sure I'm forgetting some series but.. HERE IT IS!

I also included some shows I'm not crazy over anymore but they were v important to me growing up so!! Come play bingo! pic.twitter.com/lra4PxV6ZF. also more people need to love the mess of a series which is Durarara come on y'all. I also prematurely put Banana Fish on here even tho I haven't read the manga bc I can tell it's gonna be a nightmare like that. OHHH I FORGOT ABOUT SAKAMICHI NO APOLLON THAT WAS SO GOOD!!! aaa This is so nostalgic for me!! Two of my friends in middle school said 'your drawings look like anime' and convinced me to watch it (and later Death Note)! I always wanted to cosplay one of Sakura's 5,000 amazing outfits. AA YEAH I WATCHED IT LAST SUMMER and while watching it I went to a restaurant that had a band playing jazz like that and I was like dfgHTOJHJGDFG
It's Very Good. hnn I feel ya!! I always wanted to play violin but when I was younger we were too poor and now I just choose to put my time/energy into other things so it'll never happen u nu. Ahh, still several in common tho!! . LMFAOO MISTY OH MY GOD   Ok first of all please watch Erased it’s so good —- but also you’ll probably really enjoy T&B!! Feels like grown up BNHA   Well - I mean it feels like it takes place in a similar universe!! I put off watching it for so many years until a few months ago. AAAA /slaps approved sticker on   Close enough!
I’m surprised Fruits Basket seems to be throwing people off!! I thought it was kinda classic? You too ;) So close to bingo!!!! Ah, officially waitlisted for anime nyc u nu I was very much looking forward to going back.. if any friends are looking to share, y’all know where to find me!!  ~. Aaa I’m sorry to hear that..I wish they gave a vague idea of waitlist position. I needed shots but my doc was like do u wanna wait til after ur cons and I was like oh shit an out BDBJDJSBS but if I get a cut before then I gotta go to the emergency room and get a tetanus shot . Mood I had to reference my own anime list. Omg   so close!!! I shuffled the titles and I feel like it screwed everyone up haha. Pretty soon artist alleys are gonna be so hard to get into that we’re gonna need to make table partner blood pacts. I love my brother but he drives me crazy too he’s legit mad at me bc I wouldn’t decide whether we should get dinner at 7 or 7:30 we have nothing else going on so why does it matter?! Can’t we just see how hungry we are at 7?! Jesus. /pats you
Maybe day-of tables will be a thing.. bdbdjsjehdh SAME!! After the last episode my mom and I just sat there crying for a bit . Yikes, you too?! Another skilled artist I know who didn’t get in?!  Competition must’ve been fierce.. Today in selfies pic.twitter.com/AZlTuVxC4q. Yeah..I'm sure some people will drop off....I know a few really skilled people who didn't get in though so my hopes get lower and lower orz. FDGDFG ok officially sent the email like haha hey let me keep using the studio thanks .......IM SO NERVOUS.... !! pic.twitter.com/dyZsqiSVAf. AAAAA MY HERO MOVIE DAAATESSSSS gimme tickets tickets when now tickets now???? Now? Wow I actually got a reasonable response about the studio! The manual is ten pages tho shdnhdnsbd. my brother is giving me shit bc I left two dishes in the sink. because my mom said to leave those two for her but she didn't do them. clearly my fault.redgfhghgf. me: hey do I get a tracking number
fan guy: here u go (clearly made it 5 mins ago when I e-mailed him)
I can't even be mad bc this is me. Yes!! I look forward to meeting you too!! . Pssst this is last minute but if you DEFINITELY want some of my merch mailed before the end of the month then order by tomorrow afternoon!! 

I’m gonna switch the banner then. Hand fans will hopefully arrive before ota but may be shipped between ota and flame depending on arrival. I can’t believe this didn’t set off alarm bells with the tattoo artist at least? Like they should know the history of their art form.. GOOD!! JOB!!!!! Durarara!! Doodles!!  pic.twitter.com/0sNmHkeFgk. LRT big yikes. Aaa I’m taking colo+comp next semester !! This makes sense tho! There are no Ruled in art \o/. (SCREAMING)WHATHrgffkthefucjk. LRT SAME LIKE how did you even MANAGE TO DO THIS??? yikes. (squints) my library system only has volumes 6-10 of banana fish and they're all checked out. i can't get over eiji's outfit last ep / two eps I found it so distracting LmFAO. I love these kids TT A TT Even tho they're unstable LMFAOGdfbgj. /vibrates I got my domain and upgraded my site but i gotta wait a bit before it works i think. hey my fam wants to watch a movie - any movie recs? something on netflix/amazon/somehow accessible please \o/. Ahaha we actually watched that together a while ago!! This is so soft . I'll make an announcement tomorrow but if anyone wants to peep new site/shop is  http:// cambrasine.art    :3 c

How is this real life. Relatable tweet  
I hope you can rest soon . I can’t sleep cause I can’t get air thru half my nose and so I tried to fix it w hot compress and now that side isn’t better and the other side is worse??? Pls I’m so tired. > I slept late bc I couldn’t fall asleep bc of anxiety + sinus issues
> my brother lectures me on it even tho it had 0 impact on him bc we planned to all do individual work today
> resulting in me more stressed out and upset/crying which worsens my sinuses
> ???? Problem solved? sure is fun tryna meet ot*kon's 50/50 rule while not producing a bunch of things I'll sell 0 - 5 of  ... so much else going on that I didn't get around to . making the original stuff i wanted so now i'm tryna fudge it > A<. I love him very much and we generally get along well and are close but when he’s stressed he takes it out on us/is hyper critical   old habits die hard I guess haha.. Mom: ugh these people are both going the same slow speed
Me: you mean..the speed limit?
. Wndjjdsn was AX reg earlier than usual this year?! I just looked at my spreadsheet a few days ago and decided no dates were coming up . The site just says 2018 info and sign up for the newsletter?? am I losing it or what? i feel so attacked rn. I thought that at first but then there were SO MANY PEOPLE I got stressy..thank u. like how did this even happen. Sooo...oon..SWEATS

Uchiwa / plastic hand fans arrived today! \o/
 
The  -shaped hole at the bottom of the handle is so cute~ I love that you can attach charms to it there~

You can get 'em online at  http:// cambrasine.art   , plus I'll have them at Ota and Flame later this month!  pic.twitter.com/1sHNSrjdlB. pic.twitter.com/yczSgxItlQ. Yeah or like I know some people ship once a week on X day so that could work.. I wonder if no one will want my danny phantom merch now that it's become clear that butch hartman sucks. How do y'all feel about this? I never finished it way back when bc it was for a zine that was a kickstarter instead of preorder and it didn't get funded (yikes) and any time I try to finish it it just..doesn't work? 

Is it too sketchy to print like this? Poll in replies pic.twitter.com/MAi5riTpLv. (Drawing in OP)
I kind of like the unfinished look but is it *too* unfinished looking to print? I hope so!! You're 100% right about that!! I still love Danny Phantom! I'm also really curious to see what ends up selling at Flame Con!! I'm definitely ordering a bit extra of good good gay content stuff but I wonder if it'll just be the usual popularity of fandoms and things? Wow!!! Gorgeous. Aaaa thank you nie!! . Guys if you’re ever near Ipswich, MA go to white farms I ate so much chocolate peanut butter cup ice cream I’m gonna puke but it was just as amazing as I remembered . Their frappes too. @ 92profm  what was the song you played around 7:55, right before Cake by the Ocean? oh crap this is a good idea.. My bubble wrap, tissue paper, etc. is all reused, and some of my mailers, but most of them are new > n< I'll definitely look into those!! lrt THIS and also just like if theres a snowstorm isn't it possible or maybe even likely that there were power outages? ...squints. I JUST DISCOVERED THIS A FEW WEEKS AGO Confirmed Bop from Young Person (22). ok y'all banana fish episode five
how stressful is it scale of 1 to 10 cause I wanna watch it but also I had a very relaxing day LOL. Take care of yourself! I don't wanna see more bloodied fingers on my insta feed LOOL. If you're looking to feel UNEASY and CONFUSED, then boy do I have the music video for you --

TW/Body horror??idk. Ohmygod I instantly recognized this (My bro used to go to Brown) Amazing job!!! I’m not sure why but I have this really romanticized notion of other art schools like RISD and MICA?   I’m sure they have issues too, I think it’s just because I’m such a homebody/nervous wreck that they weren’t really options but I wish I felt like I had more of a choice.. Eijis chinatown outfit made w the pink neon screen printing ink or riso....please. Call out post for both myself and @mandallin  for somehow not already doing this . SAME HAT. Holy  shit that was a ride..im glad everyone’s alright tho!! OH NO THESE ARE SO CUTE. hey kids watch out for that new paypal preorder rule..I have a bad habit of keeping lots of money in PP so I'm gonna move it just in case!! Imagine if I lost the fucking charity zine money-(shudders)

SAME GOES FOR VENMO These places can freeze your shit whenever so!! Be mindful! sorry i like don't know specifics and its late and i'm tired but point is be mindful of where you keep your money just in case cause i've seen some horror stories and all these complex rules or even just paying for some $5 item as friends/family can screw you yknow? Uh I was losing my mind bc I couldn’t breathe through my nose so I did two spray and hard inhale instead of one soft one and uhh my tongue is numb of smth whoops. Could them appearing as silhouettes be the future instead?? . Chapter 193,.,,, who else is SHOOK. There’s a couple here in Massachusetts!! Pls I need answers now Hirokoshi. I see a lot of ancestors theories but like uh why would they look so similar and have nearly the same outfits? I’m way more inclined to believe it’s future then bc they’re shown differently (silhouettes) and that they made changes to their hero costumes cause that’s a thing!! I seriously don’t even know what to make of those silhouettes there but I’m fucking hyped that’s for sure. I guess Deku could transfer it to them?? But also like it’s implied that they’re part of the past 9 so what the fuck NO ONE KNOWS IM SO CONFUSSSEDDD . Repurposed T-Shirt canon. Psst someone buy THE LAST Menons la Danse (ML Dance-Themed Charity Zine) copy so I can donate the leftover zine sales $!! #MiraculousLadybug https:// twitter.com/cambrasine/sta tus/1024806883905945600   …. (sweating) I may need..boxes to mail these fans....instead of bubble mailers.. STOOOOOOOOOPPPPPPPPPPP im cryin. THANKs, I HATE IT TT A TT <3. YEAH ITHINK IM GONNA MAKE FAN PEOPLE WAIT A LIL LONGER SO I CAN GET BOXES.. IM SORRY I don't know why it didn't occur to me that /boxes/... I don't want a bunch of bent/cracked fans arriving to y'all TT A TT </3. WOW boxes are crazy expensive but i'm gonna do it for ya <3. OH NO............. praying 4 u. TT A TT WHY IS BANNA FISH SO GOOD what the hell

I feel like I have trouble keeping up though - like it's fast so I rewound a bunch of times - but SO GOODDD I just wanna take every part in to the fullest!! for some reason this sounds like a fairy tale... I just imagine it being one and any non-artist being like ??? uh? that really doesn't seem so bad for a curse?? but artists know it is LMFAOO. YEAH so I ordered some and paid a bit extra so they'll arrive before I leave for Otakon but I can't be 100% sure!! If not then I'll mail them like err probably the Thursday after Ota? gfhhfh next 2.5 weeks are so busy. THE WHOLE THING IS EXCITING BUT THERES ALSO BIG ???? I can’t believe ash is from cape cod..never in my life did I think id find an anime character from MASSACHUSETTS LMFAOO. WAIT DO I GET TO SEE anime bg style cape cod next week omg. Right?! Sometimes Boston gets the spotlight but you rarely hear of anywhere else in MA in media.. I’m from MA but I haven’t been to the cape much but I’m still really excited to see it!!! Mood. Omg I can 100% see this happening..ngl if I happened to acquire banana fish merch and happened to be going to cape cod...would do . It has some heavy topics that could be triggering to some people, violence, etc and moves fast but it’s very good!!! Hnnn yeah I considered that I just don’t think I have enough cardboard big enough to do it  I always just reuse that stuff so it’s only what I have on hand.. Aaa that would be so awesome!! I hope you enjoy it!! I haven’t been really sunburned in a couple of years .. I feel so warm = n=. at several points during yesterdays episode i found myself overwhelmed by how cute eiji is/??? why is he so cute????????????? reminds me of shion a lot!! I just read that there won't be a (BNHA) chapter next week (stares at the wall). RIGHT ESRGDGF IDK WHAT TO THINK ANYMORE EVERYTHING IS EXCITING but I'm sure it'll be 40000 years before we know what's goin on  TT A TT </3. does anyone else have this problem? When I put my tablet away I always put my pen with it, but when I go to draw the pen is always missing.. WOW IM FEELIN SO CALLED OUT
No but I just mean putting it on the table instead of leaving it on the couch!! .. I draw on the couch bc I love to ruin my spine. Ahh yeah everyone seems to have nice desktop set ups and sit at a desk like a real person lmfao it's 100% my fault tho! The loop????? Mine's not fancy like that..? uhh i think its called like wacom pen & draw or smth silly??? mine broke suddenly when we didn't have $ so I got the discontinued/on sale one dofgdfhg. oh you know what I actually think I did have that but the plastic piece on the back comes off / holds replacement nibs and I have NO IDEA WHERE THAT IS..it kept falling off so I stopped putting it back on;;. me: time to sit down and draw some original buttons for otakon
brain: eiji okumura. Conspiracy theory: Cady is laying on my tablet pen cause it was on the couch and now it’s nowhere.. CADY I SWEAR TO GOD—- pic.twitter.com/9sRV4Bsynr. !!!!!!!! AAAAA I WISH I HAD BEEN THERE TO SEE IT!! You look amazing!! Wow!! . TT A TT They just made a post recently about whether we'd rather have no artist alley, or have an artist alley in a tent. Outside. In New England. In November. But I didn't get into Anime NYC either.... ITS REALLY UP IN THE AIR RN;; But I hope I can see it in person someday!!<3. I'm glad it was well-received! I know y'all worked hard!! <3. LRT low key me I’m so sorry— I JUST FEEL BAD THAT I MADE SOMEONE UNCOMFY BY MISTAKESJDBDJ I also try to make sure my mom is mindful when she assists me at cons!! pic.twitter.com/VCrgeXgZoT. A print for the marginalized Iida fans . LMFAOOOO NOoooo~ Michelle~~ I ACTUALLY KNOW A FEW IIDA FANS. Back in the day I could never draw tamaki suoh so why does my ash look like him . Help I’ve fallen for two eijis and I can’t get up. ..YOUR TWEETS ARE MAKING ME SO SCARED TO READ IT. LMFAOO IM... TRYING <3 THANK U MISTY. Yikes...have you seen your lie in April or ano Hana? (If so how does it compare bc I bawled at those...). Wonder Duo is a cute name, change my mind. ohh I think Kaminari will get his moment next episode!!! \o/. People who hit + run?? I’m sure it’s scary but like damn don’t you need to know if the people you hit are ok?!?! Do they not have a conscious??? I changed my lock screen to the eiji I drew and he’s so cute I’m overwhelmed every time I look LOL. LRT context for a previous tweet. Y’all making catalogues are real cute but my life is a mess i could never do that w any amount of accuracy. LRT I hope  they catch those people this time!! How many cons and artists have they hit already?! Too many!!! . SORRY I WAS SO SLOW   I’m glad it arrived safely!! Thank you for trading w me!! My bro is napping but if I nap I know he’ll give me shit...I’ve been getting 5 hours every night lately i can’t function that way, and all the days leading up to Otakon are early rise days pls save me. Oh. It’s been over a week since I got more than 5.5 hours of sleep that’s not great.. aa take care of yourself!!!!!! pic.twitter.com/ztGkvh2j2P. They’re ok ; n; shaken up tho.. Ack! I’m sorry that happened to you!! Bikers get hit way too often near my school..scary.. This drawing and concept are so cute . I don’t even know how to relax?? Like I started putting some charms together but I was sleepy so then my brother and I just hung out and it was really nice but now I’m getting ready for bed and feeling guilty for not doing something?!? For so long there’s always something - an art or merch order deadline, packages to mail, zine stuff, etc..I really need to relax more. I shouldn’t feel guilty about things like family time or going swimming for a couple hours... Hahaha yes I’ve fallen hard for Eiji from Banana Fish   
. Aaaah wow that’s really smart!! Like it makes sense - even people with full time  jobs usually have a couple days off so we should do the same...my inspiration is kinda sporadic tho so it may be hard to pick specific days.. But yeah..life isn’t about The Grind or making something or checking off a box every second  of your life so we gotta stop these bad thinking patterns and stop to enjoy things!! (ʘ‿ʘ) itchy stage of sunburn. I wanted to wear hero nejire to ota but I put on a few pounds so . My brother is always telling me to go to bed earlier but I always wake up the same number of not enough hours into my sleep (4-5) so when I sleep early I just end up being awake at 5 AM when it’s dark out. My bro is uptight again today . Aaaaaa pretty . Too scared of my phone going for a swim so no pretty lake pics but took Red Riot out today  pic.twitter.com/PPFaqb6WZc. fdkfhgfh I got 8 hours last night but I had lots of dreams so it wasn't very restful..also was up from 5 AM to 8 AM in the middle bc that's how my body works unfortunately rtihdfh
I hope you can rest more soon TT A TT Try to get a few good nights in before ota!! Yes TT A TT I love the idea of them teaching each other about their hobbies/cultures!! GUHGhghhgh I'm so sorry this happened to you.. When this happens to me I usually save one of each for displays (til Sunday afternoon) take preorders at the con using a google form!! It's a pain to mail things but people are way more likely to buy there then remember online later. mwuahaha we're doing hot dogs and burgers and mac n cheese for dinner .. my brother likes to eat healthier so I'm surprised I made this happen. fdgdg I think I like my work best when it's slightly unfinished orz Sometimes I feel like I'm overworking things and liked them better before I drew over it 1000 times trying to make it cleaner..? this is so cute i died. Poll in replies!! pic.twitter.com/gtVsDPS1WM. Video in OP! (I drew ash too I’m just too lazy to edit his irises if looking forward wins so—). Do you have a lot of glasses? Cause you could do like pay me and get glasses now, I mail u the cloth. Big mood tho I just bought boxes for the first time cause I’m too worried about fan handles cracking. They're not so hard to come by now that they've been rereleased but I spent a year going crazy looking for hero outfit Kiri nitotan so now anytime I see one I'm just like BUY IT before I have to remind myself I have one and don't *need* another. mom: These burgers are kinda big..how do you feel about that
brother: That's fine, we can just cut them up later
me: a big boy. smort!! aa well yeah I hope you can find a work-around that works for you!! \o/. YIKEs!! Yeah my worst fear is all of them breaking so I decided not to risk it . No prob!!! Yeah or you could keep like one copy even if it's your own or smth as a display!! OR MINE ACTUALLY - I have one if you wanna keep mine for display for the weekend that's ok!! I don't think it's really dirty or anything. me: packages go out after my cons so I don't have to worry about it!
me: /spends time mailing 90% of them before otakon like a dumbass. Test! pic.twitter.com/GAsiVqHmyE. u ever procrastinate on smth for literal months then suddenly do it in like an hour. anyway i'll have some new original stickers for otakon LFMAWEOFGJTDHG. Katsu waitlist    I will..get into katsucon..eventually.....................  hehe We must be on the same wavelength because I just wrote it down on my packing list!! I’m not super convinced .... Good news: in just a couple of hours I finished some drawings I had been avoiding for months and now have a few more new original things for Otakon
Bad news: they’re coming to chop down the deck in like 5 hours and then we’re going on a day trip 1.5 hours each way then packing . LRT I’m surprised I haven’t seen more posts like this??! I know people were upset about it before w anti ship flags or whatever hateful nonsense  so! I love my family and we’re very close but we all get stressed abt different things and it just takes one of us snapping to get everyone upset sbhddj. Jesus. I really didn’t feel like messing w peg board right now so I just moved my charm display back so it’ll be back on the table, literally right next to me!! Hopefully that will deter thieves!!! Aaah it’s been a few months since I’ve been to providence and some things have closed? :(. Mmm well more like I just noticed things were closed on/around Thayer - Johnny Rockets, Shanghai, 2nd time around, and Geoff’s Superlative Sandwichxes moved. Ahh is it? Yeah my bro went to brown but graduated four years ago so he’s noticed changes too. There was a cool new shop on Thayer tho - impact! It’s like everything has proceeds going towards charities or is sustainable or eco friendly etc. Ohh shake shack sounds pretty classic to replace Johnny rockets. Yeah I remember when they were building that monster of a building .. If you think I’m not gonna go to. BK and order a kids meal to get a Miraculous toy then you’re probably mistaken. these boxes could be easier to put together.. hnn wish I could re-apply to some of these cons w updated portfolio. aaa I'm glad they arrived safely!! <3 Take good care of the boys!!! . LMFAOO...none of them have any amount of a backstory or universe.. I'VE NEGLECTED THEM SINCE I WAS LIKE 17 whoops ..  THANK U tHO GLAD YOU THINK THEY'RE CUTE . Your surprised me with a bright and beautiful Kirishima so I had to try! <3. aaAA I'm so glad we traded!! I have to post a picture of your good good stuff too TT A TT 

As for the tape - it's by @Fanjo0     I gotta stop using it or I'll run out haha. Aaa I wanna do the friends oc meme thing but NO TIME RN. nana this image is a visual of my constant struggle. I 10000% don't have time for this rn but drop them here for when I do have time?! pic.twitter.com/aRsrrU9e8u. "I'll pack for Otakon tonight" - Me, every night for the last four nights. ohhh You're doing the outfit month challenge thing for him right? I think I saw~~. I know nothing dude  refs. Big yikes. Late night tweet: Why can’t men just buy pants that fit? Why do they *need* belts?! I will never understand. My bro and ex are both very average sizes and yet BELTS - BELTS ALWAYS. Hhhggrrrrrr!!!! The guy keeps telling us they’ll come later .. yesterday said 7:30, here at 6:45. Today said 9 here are 8 gdi I’m gonna get four hours of sleep cause I woke in the middle and just fell asleep again and I have so much to do today shddbbddnbd. Me: as long as I get enough sleep I’ll be ok!
Me: (screaming). You know it’s busy when it’s Tuesday and I haven’t watched BNHA. Shdjjdjs my bro is so uptight it says 40 min - 1 hr 20 depending on traffic so he decided to leave 1.5 hrs in advance regardless of traffic and now he suddenly wants to leave earlier jesus. Stress eating junk food and I know I’m doing it yet I’m STILL DOIN IT /sweats. I impulse bought this cute pastel metallic rainbow balloon and I wanna put it on my table at Flame but it’s like 2.5 feet wide LMFAOO. “I’ll just clean this drawing up and print it for the con” - me, the last three conventions

It’s her hands and weapon left can u blame me. My mom just asked me if I wanna watch Boku no hero and the answer is yes but I shouldn’t I@should pack but Technically im nkynrojmgh yndnnfndgot too tired to finish tweet. It seriously makes such a difference!! I just found this print from Momocon and I'm so excited to put it up!! It was nice meeting you!!  . wHOPPSs didn't realize my mom was onthe phone so i was jokingly flatly yelling lyrics at her. i have to
nap
i wont
mkae itdfgc. Me: ok I can nap but I’ll set alarm
I then kept shutting my alarm off and finally awoke 2.5 hours later fuck. Most cons tend to run hot but any past Otakon attendees - does it tend to be particular hot or cold? (In the artist alley if you know!). OHYMGODODGDFH THEYRE????SO CUTE??? ESP MY BOY ohmygoodness..tHank you so much TT A TT. WOW WHAT THE FUCK...... WAIT WHERE. (eyes emoji). THEYRE SO PRETTYYYY holy shit
The white handles look so nice!! This wasn't as big of a problem til recently it feels like..and that team of thiefs going around Canada cons is making it worse too.. Keep your money in fanny pack or apron, take out all $ but your start up each day, my friends zip tie their charms on instead of pins, etc. I had a few things stolen my last con for the first time in YEARS - I didn't wanna change my display bc I like how easy it is with the magnets but I moved that part so it is BACK and LITERALLY RIGHT NEXT TO ME, not at the front of the table and in a blind spot so here's hoping! BOOOO >:( That's literally ur job bro. *shoujo heroine blush* "i-i-indirect kiss". PSsst Do you mind if I put this on my instagram story? (With your link obviously)
If you're not comfy with that no worries just thought I'd ask~~. hnn I got cool new colors of straps for matsuri charms - this really pretty cerulean and orange and a rosey pink - but the USPS tracking number just stoped moving like a week and a half ago :(. Thank you!!! <3. If you get a bring print from me, instead of a sleeve you'll get a sticker w a cute girl that says Go Green! Bc plastic waste sucks and also I forgot to order sleeves so u don't have a choice nowLMFAOEGDJFh. business model: green, forgetful. if you need a song to jam to while packing for otakon then i have it  https://www. youtube.com/watch?v=ahdH8e TydWY   …. Big Yikes I haven't had this!! My fave was the USPS guy who left my prints on the side of the main street in a snowbank, no plastic. I APPRECIATE IT but I think that's probably more expensive than the $10 item they stoleLMFAOO <3 <3 <3. LMFAOO NICOLE HOW DARE U POST SPOILERS FOR THE NEXT PAGE. Do it u coward. LRT is so true. I still personally like to shave my legs fairly often, underarms, etc but I remember in middle school i was so self conscious bc my friend pointed it out that I shaved my arms. I don’t give a crap about that anymore and I certainly don’t wanna spend time on it LOL. Looking back she had really bad self image issues.. We were really close and she’d point out when I “needed” to shave so i guess her fixation on that kind of thing rubbed off on me back then.. I need to go to bed but I’m not done packing dndndndd I got really distracted counting my charms bc they were all over, culling my flipbooks to meet the 50/50 requirements, cutting down my prints that came today, etc. Ohhh that’s true!! I’ve seen posts about that!! Some had cute cats w popsicles tho heh. NOICE.  since my mom is still packing her stuff (shocking  ) I brought 90% of the bags up+out (mine, my brothers, con stuff) and my back is Broke and I’m gonna have bruises on my knees and ankles sjdndndn. Ohmygod it’s beautiful. LMFAOO I BROUGHT TWO PILLOWS SO PRETTY MUCH . I just dropped a 10 lb bag of ice on my ankle and my mom laughed and said I should put some ice on it (looks into cameras. You can run ads on insta for example but I read that if you upgrade to a business account they won’t show your posts as much cause they prioritize friends over businesses?! . I finally watched bnha yesterdaybut I prob won’t have one for banana fish . LRT q good ass thread. @ grimmfirefly. Omg the airbnb people are like “our kids are anime fanatics and they’re so excited that an industry insider is staying with us - you’re like a celebrity!”

THEY..CLEARLY DIDNT UNDERSTAND ME LMFAOO. I think they think I’m more important than I am but it is pretty cute heh. I asked what series they’re into.. Hopefully I can leave them a little surprise! I’m at a rest stop and I think I know this kid and he’s headed to Otakon but I don’t know that for sure so I’m too nervous to say hello to potentially a random stranger  LOL. TBH I SAW YOU DID IT AND I LIKED HOW IT LOOKED... I’m so sorry there’s not more to it . Ohmygodnshdbd. Dealing with town politics has got me more disillusioned than ever. This guy said the development made him to his stomach and now he’s adamantly supporting it..not the first person who ~suddenly~ changes...everyone’s getting paid off... I’m in Maryland!! Gonna do some sight seeing tomorrow, move into the airbnb for the con, etc  
IDK WHY I FEEL V NERVOUS AND UNPREPARED FOR OTA........... shddjbdndd I always feel comfy once I settle in but Djfndjdn nerves really getting me this time. Mood. I left poor deku behind... Y I K E S. SAME plus AA bags and clothes for 6 days bc I’ve never been here somehow and we’re gonna sightsee! The guy was so overconfident that my regular badge would be at the artist alley I should’ve known he was fucking Wrong. Then the guy I asked to direct me to the artist alley clearly didn’t know and took me up three flights before I showed him the map and he was like oh it’s back down four floors (looks into camera). Photo of me walking around DC today pic.twitter.com/5xNuwNApVE. LMFAOO IM FINE IT WAS JUST HOT AND SUNNY.. Pretty much . me: put things I wanna put together for otakon in a separate, accessible bag
me: too tired to do thing. sweet boy is protected from the harshness of the world. LMFAOFJESRGtdrh ohmygod ...denki..bby..u ok..
PS I saw you and Grey made a kirikami zine?!? (eyes emoji). Omg my mom is being so savage 

I let her be in charge of putting up the prints and:

“How did I end up w all the mermaids and cute girls left?”
LI draw a lot of cute girls..”
“They’re all facing the same way too...”
“Bdndjdnand dbdndndjskd”. # otakon  #feminism  #freethenipple   

(For real tho....) pic.twitter.com/BnIpVhoUhU. My stickers came out so cute but I don’t think anyone’s seeing them on my display? . LRT I’ll post this later but for now I RT! I’ll have a lil surprise at my table tomorrow!! Was gonna do it today but felt It wasn’t far for peeps who were working. Can’t believe my bro is giving me shit bc he’s “tired” when I just did set up and twelve hours in the artist alley . You can tell when an airbnb is run by a straight dude bc there is one blue and one purple body wash - u know, one for Man one for Woman - and shampoo but not conditioner. I have never been to an airbnb run by just a man that had conditioner...please. Same, to both the waitlist and gif. This is the most accurate shit I’ve ever read. “We’ve got problems enough as it is ”. Lmfao while applying saying I’ve done nothing and worked for no one I was like “....yeah I’m gonna hit submit anyway”  Some day! Omg birb son. Hey ota*on you’ve gotta be fucking kidding me I’m 15 minutes late and haven’t even gotten dressed bc it was supposed to open at eleven!!!! You’re tryna tell me AA is now THIRTEEN hours? Jesus pic.twitter.com/ySgK4N5RCy. Yeah I’d have to leave right now and I don’t have pants on so that’s still gonna be a problem   Thanks tho!! I will! So many peeps peace out early and I don’t blame em. Yeah Djfndjdn It’s Bad. Should have a scheduled break at least. I’m guessing it was their intention all along but they wrote it wrong Every Single Place. the only place the said 10 was the guys yelling at closing last night so I figured they were the wrong ones. I have *almost* sold many rolls of tape ! I have *actually* sold like two rolls of tape . Yeah..... messy... Hhmmm I’m having fun but I think maybe I built my expectations up really high   I hope Flame is a lot of crazy fun!! Seems like it may be w the scavenger hunt and stuff! Prayer circle for my nejire wig !! It’s so sosososo tangled but I really wanna cos her tomorrow !! Yep   I’ve had an unexpectedly large number of people ask me what it is and what it’s used for too like uh it’s decorative tape for decorating things w tape? The hours here are so unreasonable one artist was literally nodding off when I was in front of their table. Attendees looking at Miraculous Ladybug merch: Hmm her name what was it again...ah yes, Marionette!
Me, softly: no. At least Anime Boston’s twelve hour days end at 10, not 11. And I can’t believe today was SUPPOSED to be 13 hours?! Please . mmm IM SO SLEEPY IM LIKE DRUNK.???? Like I’m slurrriiing and giggly and sleeeeepy so If I come off weirdly i promise I’m not drunk (I don’t drink) I’m just very sleepy. HEY not 100% sure on this but this latest Otakon email says soft close at 2:00 and apparently that MAY mean they stop letting people in at 2:00!! Even though the artist alley closes at 3:00! Please spread the word to avoid disappointment at being turned away! Yeah   they’re done at 6!!! @ chriseatscandy  ?! Confirmed! Please spread the word https:// twitter.com/cambrasine/sta tus/1028462618950946816   …. They tweeted me to tell me it closes at 2:00 but... pic.twitter.com/hSkffDvcR5. I stayed cause I made some sales   should’ve left earlier yesterday tho!!! (They just keep saying these were the times all along...but like if that’s the case then you’ve been telling people the wrong time....so,..I ...). I’m sorry ——W h a t?! Did this happen to you?!! Oh my god?!! I don’t even understand WHY they would even want to let alone how that IS NOT OK. Anyway good luck everyone who wants to know what’s going on ever w the hours at this con pic.twitter.com/mhkOdEEM6x. BIG. FUCKING. YIKES. That’s. Really messed up. That should not be permitted..I certainly didn’t read Anything like that in the rules. I’m sorry this happened to you.. I’m probably going to be a few minutes late bc it’s Sunday and I’m always late Sunday bc I’m
So 
Tired. http:// Oh.my   .god. Big Ot*kon Mood. I was really looking forward to ota and I am still really happy to meet new people and see my friends, but I just built it up in my head for too many years that it couldn’t meet my high expectations and I’ve gotten bogged down a bit by frustration w logistics . Mmmmm I wanted to do doodle commissions again but I’m having off drawing days...maybe for flame. There’s 1 to 2 hours left of AA (who knows) but aaaa soon...it ends...I want to buy more and say hi to some people and I’m gonna forget something and someone. Come and get your boyyyyy~ pic.twitter.com/nvzk1ST34T. This is a call out post for @DarkGreyClouds  for making it impossible for a three way high five  pic.twitter.com/imX9pnxJt2. OH!! OK!! pic.twitter.com/vHG3PLSkzx. Third wheeling real hard. It was my first time encountering @UchuuSummer  in the wild!!! I bought thing pic.twitter.com/V7tTszBBIx. Ohoho you’ll make me blush~~~ I’m glad you’re enjoying it tho!! I definitely fell behind on messages bc of ota. I’ll play catch up soon!! I hope Flame goes really well!! I bulked up for ota but it wasn’t especially lucrative so I may run some sales at the end of the month :3 c. I did have a lot of fun seeing my friends tho!!! I forget sometimes how many people I’ve met thru AA since we only see each other at cons!! And I got to meet some new fans and artists too which is always awesome.   Safe travels home, everyone! I put on weight and yet I consciously ate three desserts today
Treat yourself??? I did $3 each for mine this weekend! Some people do 2 for 5 but I didn’t wanna go through them too quickly bc of flame. I forgot I only got a half table for flame con...narrowing down is gonna be a nightmare......... @ chriseatscandy  @DarkGreyClouds  a good Denki. Me: bakuGOu
My brother: bakuGONE
Me: ....I’m using this. Me on Thursday: wow So many sick people here 
Me last night: ...uh oh
Me today: con...plague. Fuuuccck we have one day to sightsee together, half a day, airport, then 8 hour drive home, 2 days, 4 hours drive, flame con...I can’t believe I’m sick. LMFAOO IM HERE FOR THIS POSITIVE TSA CONTENT . Thank you!! Just trying to stay lucid thru our one day of sightseeing . Tfw they say there’s a tornado warning and stay inside but the museum closes in 15. They made an announcement?? So confusing. You’ve seen “Holding-up-the Leaning-Tower-of-Pisa”, now get ready for —- pic.twitter.com/aheeqnZslE. pic.twitter.com/pbACisKbYW. Ngl I was really proud of myself. Last night w my bro and he fell asleep on the couch  :(. I can’t believe I’m sick. I washed my hands so diligently. “—- and You won’t believe what happened next!!”. Tfw you’re asked to change the address on smth u sent three weeks ago . Almost home. Tired. (Driving thru Worcester)
“Polar: The inferior soda”
“Polar: Yeah, we’re still here”
“Polar: You know, the OTHER soda with a polar bear for a mascot”
“Polar: We did it first - we swear - you can look it up!”. Omg my bro took a plane across the country while we drove home and we arrived to our respective homes at almost the exact same moment. Hnnn I am definitely Sick and getting Sicker but it’s not like 100% full blown..I hope it’s just a mild one cause if not that just means it’ll get worse and worse and prob peak around Flame Con... Oh my god?!! That’s so extreme?!?   I’m sorry that happened to you.. Blessed. Will you....have this this weekend..? . PS - I’ll prob /bring/ almost everything, but I am gonna have a three foot display for the first time?? ever?? at Flame Con, so if you don’t see smth you had in mind on display then please just ask! .  I’ll be by... I am always comfy when I get all set up and settled, but if I don’t do a con for too long, my anxiety rears it’s head bc it’s like I’ve already forgotten that the experience is always fine...so I was so anxious for Otakon and of course it was fine (well, actually, there were A. Lot of organizational issues but that’s not what I was worried for—), and I told myself “just remember this and don’t be stressed for your next con!” And yet here I am, stomach churning abt flame   NY is such a stress fest and it’s a new con for me,,,. Meaning I’m unfamiliar with the process, venue, crowd, experience, etc.. plus gotta shove into 3 feet somehow.. Please don’t misinterpret this bc I’m Excited and genuinely think it’ll be a good time I’m just. Wwwwworried!! Stupid brain. . Aaaa I’m sorry you’re like this too LOL .. Anxiety is...it’s even more frustrating when you Know it’ll be fine and still can’t stop feeling that way.. I also feel like every con has like its own unique special thing to be anxious about on top of the general... I think the reason I’m extra stressed for Flame is bc I’m not 100% sure on my sexuality yet? It didn’t bother me before bc I thought I’d just keeping living my life and figure it out that way but the discourse in June abt pride/who did/didn’t belong got me kinda stressedcbbv. Like what if someone asks me abt it or scolds me telling I shouldn’t be there or???? Idk My brain knows that’s not super likely but w anxiety it’s always like “hey what’s the absolute worst that can happen?”..... ...end thread LOL SORRY JUST BEEN NAGGING AT ME. Right?! It’s just exhausting to experience?? Like I felt happy and relaxed but so tired Friday night bc “look! It was fine!” But I had gotten myself so worked up in the morning/days before. Mm.. I was w one guy from 15 til a month ago so it hadn’t really been on my mind as much as someone who was single? Maybe?   asfhkkbb Thank you Andy. I’m ok!!  Lmfaooo Relatable. Now why don’t they make a button with /that/?   like I have a vague idea but I figured when it becomes relevant to my life I’ll just know how I feel abt the person or whatever??? Idk..Right now I just wanna focus on myself and school and art!! Weeps yeah I don’t think I ever get more than half a night’s sleep before a con hahah Oh well! We make it through in the end!! yeah, you’re right   I had the same thoughts as you, I just figure no matter where you are there’s always That One Person, yknow . Yes!! There’s a lot of new people I’m excited to meet them and see their work!! Yeah, it’s surprising that they’re the same weekend in NYC  I hope both are a success, too! I wish we could go to both, so maybe next year they’ll pick different dates.. . There are artists I really wanna meet and support at both cons too . Hnn very relatable!! It’s like - as an artist sometimes someone in mutuals w will post later about meeting me or buying from me and I’m like WHY DIDNT U SAY SMTH - yet when the tables are turned I always get too shy . LMFAO “if you’re gonna ask incredibly personal questions at least give me $ first”   Yikes though!! I think cons get some people in this headspace of “whatever” instead of like hey this is still part of polite society. Trying to sleep this cold off w mild success
Gonna take today easy, catch up on emails and anime
Packages may wait another day. Omg Cady is walking so delicately on the new deck like she doesn’t trust it which is ridiculous bc the OLD deck literally shifted under your feet and could have collapsed at any time... New addition by @nucheki  !!  pic.twitter.com/2uGUaQSG9V.  (PS SEE YOU AGAIN THIS WEEKEND I GUESS LMFAOO). Aaaa bnha was so good this weeeeek!! Kaminari got his spotlight and that moment that’s building tension for The Confrontation aaaaaaaaAaaaaaa. me: let me know if your zine didn't arrive!
also me: (Checks every single zine shipment). It’s so hard w international ones bc practically every package I send to Mexico doesn’t make it to the person and some countries don’t continue updating the tracking so you can only see it leaving NY. This cold is stupid I feel just sick enough to not have the energy for some of the things I need/want to do, but not sick enough to feel justified in doing nothing. Wtf this is really cute... THIS is the kind of stranger interaction I’m here for. u ever almost follow someone for their nice art and then u see they start calling people names in once-civil twitter arguments and u PEACE RIGHT THE HELL OUTTA THERE. omg this is true. galaxy brain: I should be thanking them for saving me the trouble--. SERIOUSLY some people --- like FUN FACT: u can argue abt smth fandom-related without suddenly calling someone the c-word \o/ bye!!! OHh, will you be there Liz? Or you've just been before? I'm sure it'll be fine..just..anxious brain yells@me LOL Thank you for the reassurance . RIGHT Then I always worry like if they don't know what I'm talking about will I feel bad? I feel bad bc sometimes followers will say their name to me and i'm like 'oh! uh! yeah!' without really knowing then later realize 'oh, it was so-and-so with that icon that always replies!'. like..my con brain and ability to recognize faces, names, etc. Is BAD PLEASE FORGIVE ME, EVERYONE... scream i read 8/24 for tickets but like???WHEN?? midnight??noon???mystery. PSsst do you happen to know if you have Banana Fish? I'm gonna try in NY this weekend but it's hard to find in a store > A<. Darn! It's so hard to find.. Good luck to us both! haha. Yeah!! As long as he didn't bother u afterward or anything then hey that's pretty cute and cleverr! sometimes when i see cute pronoun buttons i'm like 'oh it's so cute! but maybe this isn't meant for me' and then i remember that every post i've ever seen is like cis people should do that too bc it normalizes not assuming gender and such so maybe i should get one after all. crying for all the artists separated by Liberty City and Flame Con this is some romeo and juliet shit minus all the hate and yknow death and stuff. This! I’ve definitely lost money on certain kinds of items - or rather it’s just not worth it even if u only have to sell 10 to make it back like ok u sold 20 now what do u do with the other 80 yknow? $ and SPACE are important factors for a lot of people, eps young people!! Ok I replied to every zine email, checked every tracking number, and contacted those that may have issues. I’m gonna watch banana fish while I eat dinner and by that I mean take two bites of my sandwich then hit play, go “Ohmygod” 1000 times and not touch my food ever again. Me, watching banana fish episode 6, yelling “MASSACHUSETTS”. Context: My brother bought a nice plant print at Otakon 

Bro: So I went on this person’s website and there was a lot of like...really, really obscene.. not-safe-for-work stuff
Me: Like gore or po—-
Bro: It was like /drawn/ porn!
Me: ... yeah and? 

. Uh oh is this abt lib??? Context: I let Cady off in the woods but at home she runs through roads, backyards so I'd never let her off-leash let alone WITHOUT HER COLLAR there but today I literally just opened the door and walked outside w her. Luckily she had to pee so I caught her but ogsjdrtdfh my brain. If I'm off my game at Flame Con pls forgive me ........................ omg my mom happened to be by BK so I asked her to see if they sold the toys separately for ML (they used to at McDonald's!! I remember from Neopets days..) but they guy said they didn't so she bought a kids meal even tho I told her not to and got from the last round of toys LOL. An attempt was made. LMFAOo there was -- a drawing of Small Might doing the holding up his shirt w his teeth thing on my TL and I made a funny noise and my dog lifted her head to look at me like 'u ok buddy'. UPDATE pic.twitter.com/BQbhFcX8oM. LMFAOO SHE WAS LIKE I EVEN BOUGHT A MEAL AND THEN THEY GAVE ME THE OLD TOYS. Fact. this should be a meme
make it happen, internet. she is Very Good. husgdg this kiri tho. errr I think i may have bronchitis. THEY'RE ALL VERY CUTE BUT I AGREE -- tbh Im biased tho bc he's my best boy .. I like Midoriya a lot too but again he's MY RUNNER UP BEST BOY SO gosh I'm so biased. casually coughs up blood. sdgsfg I hate trying to make doctors appointments///the medical staff are nice but the admin people are???so mean?? all the time?? I s2g it took me almost A FULL HOUR to get a doctors appointment. I just wanna know if i need an antibiotic or if i should be wearing a face mask to flame con or what. Omg the nurse was so nice she insisted on seeing my art and she was like “OH MY GOD, OH MY GOD I LOVE THAT I LOVE THAT SO MUCH YOU SHOULD MAKE LIKe coloring BOOKS OR DOLLS OR —- YOURE GONNA GO FAR!” . I had a good banana fish charm idea now just give me the Strength. I had a pure idea and now I have a spicy idea send help https:// twitter.com/cambrasine/sta tus/1030172249029009408   …. LMFAO This is so true 

Me, yesterday, looking at all the amazing artists at Flame Con and sulking about inferiority 

This lady, today, exuberantly supportive . Heh they’re too different so I’d have to just make both~. Omg
I feel like my style isn’t suited to the spicy one   I’ll try tho!! Thank you!!  No cons after Flame so I guess there’s not a rush . U ever see a sexist ad and then it’s not even drawn weIl . (Not that it would b redeeming if it were drawn we’ll, I’m just saying it is 1000% eyesore). OHMYGOD you’re having such a time lately I’m so sorry. Omg I’m sorry . /wraps u in a blanket. Good news my lungs are clear so she gave me an antibiotic in case I’m gets worse
Meanwhile I got?? Stung by smth???!!  ow. Yeah my mom said the guy was new and didn’t know anything . it's not really my thing but i'll admit todobaku is such a pretty boy ship hahaha. lrt I love..this show..so much..wanna...re..wat ch..no time. OHh that's good at least but omg ... amanda... u hold the key......
(no but I haven't read the manga yet - don't like reading big portions online bc migraines - but I'M SO SCARED????? Judging by others' reactions seems like it'll wreck me?). hnn this is true!! I wish I could feel like this but it's hard when you're constantly seeing and surrounding yourself with beautiful artwork. aaa he's your icon now!!! beauty!

PS HAPPY BIRTHDAY!! <3. canonically pretty boy ship LOL
I guess KiriBaku technically is too ..I -- I love my boys but their spiky hairstyles look too stupid together LMFAOO. OMG I JUST WATCHED LAST WEEKS YESTZERDAY SO I DINT REALIZE BANANA FISH TODAY
I also just generally thought today was Wednesday and had my mom try to order a Wednesday special LMFAOO. LMFAOO but we love a good friendly rowdy boy
It's fun to play w his hair too!! down! up! ponytail! etc.! my banana fish merch plans keep getting more idiotic prepare yourselves. banana fish episode 7: (screams into pillow). DFGDHDGH THATS NO T WHAT I WANTED TO HEAR---. i can't believe i have to leave again tomorrow.. i want...one more day... (whispers)I 'm scared hold me. I'm still upset this isn't their ship name..Anyway- 
IT LOOKS GREAT AND IM EXCITED TO GET MY HANDS ON IT! Aside from the whole revenge + banana fish mystery things like just imagine if they just like. Left and went to japan. Seems real unlikely to me that they’d be followed there???The end???? /wraps Ash and Eiji in a blanket EVERYTHING IS FINE (don’t let me read the manga I’m scare). IMMNMM SO EXCITED FOR THIS WEEKS CHAPTER:

(Mild spoilers)

> Momo should always have a dope cape 
> Bakugou’s suit looks v silly I love 
> HE!!!!!! /HE/!!! I remember what horikoshi said abt him before in an interview so I’m really glad!! I can’t remember exactly but think it was something like not initially having big plans for him but that he was gonna see if he could give him a bigger role bc the fans expressed their interest or smth like that!! So IM GLAD HE IS BACK whether it’s permanent or not. Narrator: He isn’t. I’m having really bad post nasal drip and can’t sleep bc of it so I tried numbing my throat w a cough drop. Spoiler: it didn’t work and now I’m nauseous bc I had an empty stomach. I’ve been up   all night . “Oh hey u changed ur outfit”
“THE FUCK DO U WANT!!!! SAY IT TO MY FUCKING FACE!!!!!!”
Bakugou, please —-. THAT’S AMAZING!!! WE’RE ALL ROOTING FOR YOU!! I just reread this and I pretty much said “if u just forget the whole premise of the show and send two wholesome boys away to another country to live together in peace then it’s happy!!!!”. FACT. Fuuuuuuuuuck
This cold has been pretty mild and I even thought it was going away last night so I was gonna get up early to finish packing and head out by noon...until I literally couldn’t sleep until 8 AM bc of post nasal drip and now I feel like shit and it’s 1 and I’m in bed. mei this is beautiful.

Ok..leaving for flame now   My cold is getting worse so if you see a middle aged woman at my table for a good chunk of tomorrow then pls tell my mom she is a blessing and I don’t deserve her. Ways to know you’re PMSing:
> Mysterious pains in the area of your body containing your reproductive organs
> Literally crying saying goodbye to your dog when you’ll be back in 48 hours. Not feeling particularly bad ass but thank you . [RADIO] “We’ll fly you to Denver, CO to see 21 Pilots - hotel and flight on us!”

“Am I really gonna schlepp all the way to Denver, CO to see 21 Pilots?”
“I got the email about that”
“Did you enter?”
“No, because I was like why am I gonna go all the way to Denver, CO to—“. BNDIDNDN almost had a panic attack bc even tho I checked the weather we ended up driving thru severe thunderstorms . Can’t believe no one else likes well enough but doesn’t LOVE them. Jjssjjd fuck I just keep feeling worse. Bc of storms we won’t arrive til 3 instead of 1. Maybe I should’ve stayed home but I just wanted to have fun ..I’ve been looking forward to it..and not lose $. Stopped for a bit and my mom was like jenn are you SURE you don’t wanna go home and I decided I didn’t want to have been stubborn enough to insist on going but not stubborn enough to actually GET THERE. Gonna arrive then see how I feel in the morning ndndjd. Alright alright Whose ready for 4 hours of sleep 2 hours of set up 8 hours of work while sick!!! Me???? Me!!!!!!! pic.twitter.com/0JlWWP4Y1A. The hotel room door doesn’t completely close I don’t care I’m going to bed bhvvnn. The road our hotel is on was closed and according the construction worker “all the streets are closed” which wasn’t really a helpful fucking instruction but eventually dragged my shit to a place a cab could get to me so I’ll arrive eventually I feel shitty please end me.

I haven’t interacted w lot of people yet but I can tell this place really appreciates art. Most people seem to be carrying it around and a lot of the people in the lounge are reading zines and comics ! Lmfaooo no andy you’re not alone this is me too. Lmfao omg this reminds me - my grandma was always telling us one of our relatives use to be a peddler and she was like “he was the junk man!” And we were always laughing like wtf does that mean? He just sold junk? Aaa there’s a rowdy boy heeeereeee I think he’s a guide dog but he’s wearing a flame con cape too and he is so excited. Hey!! I’m at my table for a bit so come say hi! Djfndjdn thank you   I came and grabbed the zine but didn’t really introduce myself  I plan to rest up tonight so hopefully I can meet more people properly tomorrow!!

Wacom: here’s a tiny colored elastic band to help you customize your stylus 
Us: yeah that’s not really what I’m looking for. My mom is snoring I can’t find my ear plugs petition to let me rest. I just laid down and intermittently slept and asked my mom for various meds
I missed dinner u nu. I haven’t gotten up yet but I’m 99% sure I now also have my period and god has forsaken me. Yep. And bc I took medicine last night I can’t take as much as I need today. Every other period is incredibly painful so haha here’s to my hoping!!! My cold symptoms are not good but better but my voice sounds way worse so gomen. Mood. Hdjdjd why the hell is theft against independent artists up 1000% lately? (Source: my twitter log). I am here but in no shape for fighting (cold from Otakon + knives in my uterus) . I’ll try to come by!! . Hey y’all I’m at my table for a while !! feeling better than yesterday now that meds kicked in . Ehh yeah Flame con sales aren’t so hot (pun intended) So once I recover I’ll prob run a sale or smth cause I bulked up for ota too which was good but not great. Lunch break! Back at my table after this pic.twitter.com/zV2APNy8VP. Fun fact I kinda hate soup and only eat it when I’m sick ??? Idk why soup just isn’t my thing. Back at table!! Hnnn happy to go home to my puppet and be in my own tonight. Me@that person . MY PUPPY NOT PUPPET YIKES. AND IN MY OWN BED Ohmygod I messed this tweet up badly. Hnn thank you I promise I will!!!

I’m gonna take a few days to rest + recover after pushing myself too damn much this weekend. I haven’t forgotten about my shop orders and I’ll be sure to throw in buttons or coupons or smth to make up for it!  I also don’t wanna spread Ota plague thru the mail LOL. Doc have me a perscription and dated it for today in case I wasn’t better and tbh I’m way worse than when I saw her but still not sure if I need antibiotics or not?? I don’t wanna take it if I don’t but like damn how do I kno. Hey y’all any fluffy fic recs? Pls heal me. I know this is pretty unimpressive compared to what some of you do on the daily but I’m signed up for three classes instead of two this semester..I hope it works out > n< I’ll never get a stupid degree at this rate. Djfndjdn I know I’ve been complaining a lot bc I’ve felt really shitty and those cons weren’t lucrative but I really was happy to meet a lot of fans and artists I wouldn’t have been able to meet otherwise!!!   . Volume 20 cover is gorgeous and impressive so I’m so sorry to tweet this but I can’t help but giggle at little tiny nejire floating above deku . I forgot I wanted to make a fairy Nejire charm forever ago pic.twitter.com/E4P4IaIjA2. In the past few weeks my brother has gotten no less than 5 bee stings?!

Unfortunatley that’s how my brain works....hence no more zines/big group projects/cafés for a while.. (softly) I ended up..feeling worse..that's how colds work you thinky ou're doing better and then YOU ARENT lmfaoo. lmfaoo the lady at the tile store was literally using tiles to swat flies and didn't care at all and then we brought one home and leaned it on the countertop and it fell and shattered?! HOW. I don't even mean it fell to the ground it was on the counter leaned against the wall and it just fell flat on the counter nad DIED. i want to hear a version of this song that doesn't seem to exist and it's frustrating LOL like I don't like the original version w the autotune and stuff. I want to hear a pretty piano version but there's not one with a vocalist hnn. aaa I'm feeling so in the groove w drawing today i just wish i felt better so i could utilize this to its fullest!!!!

Hnhnhn I skipped applying for a local con I enjoyed the last two years bc I had SJ which got Fucked Up so now I have nothing and I’m really sad I’ll miss the other con..do you think it’s rude to write to ask if they have a list or process for day-of cancellations/no-shows?? They follow me on insta  I just don’t want to destroy our good relationship. So many things to do   all important aaaaa. Blushsprout, mamobot, and sugarbones do this too!

At ota someone was debating having a cosplayer sign the merch they bought from me or giving it to them as a gift so I gave them a second one ! I hope they were able to meet them!! I don’t think that’s possible  they both go on top. I need to get back in this game........or maybe I'm just gonna let the lewds start to trickle in LOL. I put together like 5 shipping boxes and I'm tIRED. My piece for Dear Kiri! @kirishima_zine  
It was amazing to work with so many artists I admire 
We're not ready just yet, but I'm pleased by how much we will be able to donate to organizations doing such important work!

BIG YIKES...hnnn I’m sorry you experienced this!! All my con experiences have felt very welcoming but there’s assholes everywhere in life unfortunately.. I hope we’re able to get it taken down.  thank you for sharing !! It’s so cute when she uses a pillow for her head like human... pic.twitter.com/2GYY3fjOCE. Hnnn bad luck but maybe it’s over now!! I hope you enjoyed the rest of the convention! It’s hard but try to focus on the good points - like selling out of your doujin and meeting fans !! . My mom reprimanded me bc she could tell I was gonna start picking at my lip and now IM PICKING AT MY EYEBROW INSTEAD@anxiety pls stop. I typically download from  http:// horriblesubs.info    but it's also on Prime! Not on Funi or Crunchyroll as far as I can tell. Catch me and @pukaparade  at Gr*nite State Comic Con bc we love to suffer ??? !!! The Night is Short, Walk on Girl was so wild!! What an experience. I wish I had seen it both nights. It’s very fast-paced so with subtitles especially it seems like the sort of thing you watch twice! aaa I really enjoyed it!! Most of the audience was really in discussion afterwards tho!! I'm bad at analyzing things but I had fun watching it and the animation was so lively so!! I enjoyed it in my simple way ahha I'm glad you enjoyed it too!! packages!! "!!! FRIEND!" - me, recognizing names while doing packages. I love it  I have some tang based ocs so it’s close to home ahha. @ riasaur  I feel like we’re twitter name bros rn. I'm putting con stuff AWAY but I can tell Cady's moping bc she thinks we're packing up to leave again TT A TT. hnn freakin usps..a package destined for Germany went from NY to Miami then Barbados then disappeared, a package for the UK went to Australia, another was scanned at my post office then never again like it never moved, etc... I love..running zines /lays down. crying when u see a zine u applied for publicly inviting people. hewwo pls let me in. Aaa amazing!! You totally deserve your invite! This is also the first zine I've applied to in like 6 months? MORE? So I feel you BF will be our death LOL. JUST KIDDING THERES TWO BANANA FISH ZINES AND I ONLY APPLIED TO ONE wth is this nightmare. yeah..turns out it's different from the one I applied for....two..simultaneous..banana fish zines..please guys, coordinate!!! AND YOU KNOW THE SECOND ONE KNEW ABT THE FIRST CAUSE THEY HAVE THE SAME HANDLE BUT WITH AN S ADDED BC IT WAS TAKEN i'm crying. hnn yeah ............i don't know about that......the one I applied to seems to not be updating much tho so I hope it keeps going too :O

I DONT MEAN TO SHIT-TALK THO HAHA HI IF YOURE READING THIS PLEASE LET ME IN----- . but yeah imo invites should go out before the deadline.. ; n; It seems a bit rude to those who applied to be asking people after they closed...and...publicly........................Again not trying to make enemies+I'm not perfect, just think it's nice zine organizing etiquette! LMFAOO THANK U FOR YOUR SUPPORT haah

sgtrhdtdh yeah..Idk, I'm confused so I'll just wait and see what happens with the one I applied to;; I hope they're both successful tho! <3 <3 <3 
true!! I haven't had such a strong new love since YoI and BNHA! So two years?!
hnnn I think I actually missed apps on that one and applied to the other? There's two at once.. But I hope both are successes and I'm excited to see the creations that come out of them! My pure sunshine friend @squigglegigs  has severely injured her foot + will not be able to work for a few months 

Please support her by buying her adorable acrylic charms! (+ check out my other friends' adorable pins+patches too!)   

Shop:  http://www. etsy.com/shop/GiraffeCos  . !! I have a small following but I'll post this around too!! Great idea! I only found it because I looked for it when my friend was teasing me about running one haha
Ohh, I didn't realize that distinction!   * U*. hnn in the end out of about 305 packages 7 haven't been confirmed but probably have or will soon arrive, 14 have disappeared/probably won't arrive \o/

MUCH WORSE THAN THE like 1000 BTMH zines we sent and I feel like only like 5 went missing......... hnn spent 3.5 hours packing my packages and trying to hunt down missing zines orz I just..want to draw.../looks wistfully into the distance
anyhow time FOR BED. /CHOKe I was tryna make my slightly lewd BF charms and the style came out kinda like Disney for me??? I GOTTA REDO LMFAOO. Mmmmmjoeysoutofrehab a week earlier than he said and also my nervous habits have returned  ....two..unrelated events...haha... I HAVE IT + NEVER USE IT theres a learning curve on using the software, and mine always has some kind of problem (unable to read registration marks, needs to cut 3x on deepest for it to go thru, etc) When it works it’s great but when it doesn’t..Maybe you’ll have better luck tho! IMO hand cutting < silhouette < just paying for someone to make them...to me the time I save is worth the like .40 per sticker. Hnnn another beautiful day but I’m still not well enough to bike ride...colds tend to linger on me anyway but I definitely pushed myself too much last weekend . hnn trying to make a test donation for kiri zine but it says 'processing' forever.. Are you in AANI? I can tag you on the post about where I got stickers recently! They were cheap and nice and shiny and best part is no MOQ! They sell sample packs for $1 too. I would DM you but it's telling me I can't ; n;. just received a return package that I mailed on May 14th /eyes glaze over. Also like even if u weren’t offering stuff in return sometimes people just need fucking help??? Cause shit happens?! When we were really poor this charity said they’d fund my dog’s surgery if we could fund the test to make sure her heart was strong enough so I posted offering my work and such and someone just donated like half the cost and it was..really amazing. I think abt that sometimes. I haven’t drawn him yet but I like shorter a lot too   I haven’t watched today’s ep yet aaaa. Unfortunately, AA theft is on the rise + having your $ attached to you can help prevent theft - so I'm gonna plug my bro's friend's org!

They employ women in Haiti + make these fanny packs using recycled materials! Plus they look rad!

ps you'll be able to tell when I start reading the manga cause the way i draw them will probably morph LOL. I watched this week’s episode. HNNN THIS SHOW IS BAD FOR MY HEART!!! Is it gonna be a blood bath?   damnit eiji u should’ve gone home and dragged ur friends w u I can’t deal w this shit. guys how am i supposed to keep watching the show
my heart
MY HEARRTEjdhifhkghl. my opinion on ship wars: everyone shut the fuck up. i'm crying somehow I read bone and ball first and i was like "oh my god are they talking about what parts of the chicken are in the nugget----". i'm big dumbass energy today. someone has to be brave. some people run zines in such a like..weirdly dismissive way????? Like there was one that was like send us your piece, maybe we'll put it in (like a contest?) and one that's like we wont even let u APPLY if we don't like your work. I HAVE TO DO MORE PACKAGES 
rn I make enough sales for it to be time consuming but not enough to be able to like HIRE SOMEONE TO DO THE WORK FOR ME SO I CAN DRAW LMFAOOO hello pls do the not-fun part of making merch for me, only fun for me only FUN. you're right dani -- (clears throat) HEY !!! !EVERYONE!!  SHUT THE !! FUCK !!UP!! like don't get me started on hate and threats but even just civilized debate is like ok if that's your thing then fine but also you could just both enjoy yourselves separately instead. yeah. i've seen some shit. LOL. meanwhile i'm over here like 'when I don't accept this person they will cry and i will feel BAD' ... THIS HAPPENED REALLY BADLY W KIRI ZINE bc everyone cared so much..which is good but also bAD. WAIT..IS THIS REALLY THE CASE THESE DAYS?? I know sometimes they're little babies that should not be in charge of things but??? not even making any art or writing for it? like.. I ... I guess that's... ok but ..idk seems weird...to just do the admin part isn't fun. right or like 'i'm not gonna send u hate for your ship but i need u to kno that mine is MORE CANON and SUPERIOR' like no that's bad please go home. i'm yelling on the internet  a lot tonight . sorry LOL
idk which is worse me hyper tweeting or sad tweeting. Right? And some people I was like I LOVE YOUR STYLE/WORK but there's so much unfinished stuff it's hard to judge it in comparison to others hnnn. mmm should i give eiji an undershirt on lewd-ish charm
(he'll still have his button up....well unbuttoned a bit HAHA). ahh .. yeah I think most are one or the other but you're right I have one in mind where I think that was the case...odd. HNN YEAH like the cursed one that give people unsolicited criticism...please..intentions were probably good but it was. REALLY BAD TO DO THAT. So bad. yikes. 

But yeah I've clicked on some mods and it'll be like "15 years young :)" and i'm like HAHA NOPE. sNORT eiji i'm sorry bby boy---. i've tweeted this at least twice before but why is vance joy just so good yknow. why did gnash only get five seconds on the radio that was bullshit. Yeah!! I had someone ask me for critique so I gave it to them bc I had a good idea of what they could work on but sometimes that kind of pressure is really awkward for organizers too;; BUT UNSOLICITED being like 'heres WHY you're not good enough' is wild. and not every rejection means 'u werent' good enough!!' sometimes it means 500 people applied and we let in 50 !!!! 
and yeah 15 year olds CAN T BE TRUSTEd..even mature ones like sorry but you're not ready for it?? It's a big burden to take on too!!! i want to make a zine and organize a holiday artist alley fair please dno't let me do these things thanks. I KNOW NOTHING ABT FANTASY FOOTBALL BUT IT SOUNDS BAD AND SO ARE SHIP WARS SO IAGREE. haha ha there's not enough time to do all the things i need to do let alone the things I want to do hahaha i'm feeling 
so overwhelmed
haha.ha. the people have spoken https:// twitter.com/cambrasine/sta tus/1032821927356911616   …. dhifsgf gi'm feeling so awful and overwhelmed i'm gonna try to get like 90% of my remaining packages done tonight..............

I'm torn bc obiovusly I prefer subtitles but I'm always curious about the dub AND it's a day sooner..........................dare i do both................. AA I was thinking of you too bc I saw you were at the Free! movie that I missed bc I took a nap LOL. I'll be w my friend and my mom (she watches too LOL) in F8/7/9 but... SO..SORRY I BOUGHT EXTRA (they're refundable) IN CASE THE PLUS ULTRA CAFE STAFF WANTS TO COME -- no one else is online and I didn't think of it in advance! So I bought the ones next to me orz. BUT @circusbonez  is in the group in the furthest back row!! so you could sit there! I just couldn't sit there bc my eyesight isn't great. snORT I wanna cosplay nejire but SO MUCH HAIR ...also that wig has been tangled for like 6 months I can't untangle it at all . ((if they do and the cafe fam doesn't claim all the tix I reserved+offered them then hmu ;* )). me (opens my trenchcoat to reveal digital tickets) hey kid, ya like anime? hnn yeah Idk if/when AMC is gonna get their butts into gear but showtimes are up for the Regal Fenway (Boston) and Kendall Sq (Cambridge)! Can get Regal thru Fandango but it's more expensive so better to go to their, Kendall you have to go to their site. oh my god I just realized I can bring my ita bags and fit so many sNACKS IN THEM. I'm a n00b I haven't seen the 2000s Classics like Naruto, Bleach, ONE PIECE, etc............ aaa I should make a special sticker or button for the movie premier!! THAT WOULD BE FUN WILL THEY GET MAD AT ME THO?? for handing stuff out?! aa I think the bigger problem is... I'M REALLY SHY HAHA...
(That's really cool tho!! I wanna be That Guy!). "but I'm caught up on the manga"
"(SWEATING..) They're from uh.. SMASH..!!". omg everyone says hxh will change my life maybe I should watch it afterall... aha I finally watched Soul Eater, I think that's as close as I got to the classics haha. ahaha I wanna make buttons or stickers or smth!!! 
Idk that they'll..let you into the theater with boba tho..it seems like the kind of thing you can't sneak in really;;. omg...hxh musicals?! hnn it's only cause I was watching magical girl stuff around that time instead;;. SOUL EATER IS VERY GOOD.. I have to read the manga but I heard Crona gets screwed over so IDK IF IM READY
aaa everyoen's really into hxh!! It's definitely on my list...the key is...finding TIME. yeah!! There are different dates! Opens w the dub the 25th, subs the 26th..p sure the rest are dub and there's one more subs date but I'm not sure what it is;;. I think AMC hasn't listed their tickets yet so I'm GUESSING it'll be in more theaters but not sure!! Hnn amc put their tickets up - I just got the email - but it’s only at the Boston one still...depending on where you’re coming from the Cambridge one may be a little less inconvenient. @ BakaPandy  ! https:// twitter.com/cambrasine/sta tus/1032868875107479553   ….

“I have no intentions of making friends”
HAHA OK BUDDY IVE HEARD THAT ONE BEFORE AND LOOK AT HIM NOW . Mwuahaha I totally predicted the function of his mask!! Welll maybe that wasn’t so difficult but I’m still patting myself on the back a bit haha. Yeah I have six extras but I offered them to my café fam last night!! I’m not sure how many will be taken by them or not :o if there’s still seats left try to get those first? Hnnn I didn’t hear from Joey at all yesterday,,, which is fine but he hasn’t read my message from last night either...hope he’s ok..gdi I feel like I’m back where I started. hnn I didn't sleep well (shocking) so I'm already tired. crying bc I asked abt my waitlist position AND no-show tables and just got a copy pasta'd response that ignored half my email dfgdfhg ..  I had to resend... pic.twitter.com/pwE7lETWOb. YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME LMFAOOO I would’ve been out of there?! What is this a job interview? . Ohh I found four more zines!  It’s bc I was packing in the living room before. Wtf I just tried to go into the Wendy’s we always drive thru so I walked expecting a door but there wasn’t and this hot guy in the middle of changing his shirt redirected me . Hn yeah I’ll do that but I’m worried abt how long it’ll be haha.... Hi there! I’m not 100% sure of the details since I’m not involved there (just promoting a friend of a friend!) There’s more info on their site or you can contact them :). Ohh they added more! FYI everyone Funi just sent the email about My Hero tix and a lot of theaters were added since last night!! . LRT this is so true..I know very little about coding but what I do know is from neopets and later tumblr. So they..are making a zine but they’re not MAKING the zine, just compiling it into a pdf and making merch?   That’s ..IT SEEMS WEIRD WHEN THE POINT IS USUALLY TO MAKE A BOOK but ?! Maybe it’ll be interesting ahha. Aaa see you there!! fuck me, why am I always right? I hate that I'm always right. Stupid gut. I know him too well.. one day out of rehab and already.. It wasn't long enough..I knew it was too soon but I didn't wanna be discouraging..maybe the next one will work... https:// twitter.com/cambrasine/sta tus/1033020856467906560   …. like fuck obviously there's a bigger problem behind the behaviors that needs to be addressed but like ...aGAIN just administer the medication to him and you could avoid these SPECIFIC incidents?! sorry y'all back to sad tweeting i'll shut up soon. it was nice a quiet about this issue for a while huh? ..hah. earlier this summer I got really derailed bc of getting depressed and consumed worrying about him so I really gotta not fucking do that. Too much i need and want to do to let that happen again. CADY ISNT SYMPATHETIC AT ALL she saw me break down and was just like 'uhh' and now she's barking at me like damn your biggest problem is you didn't get to run in the woods /today/ cady back off LMFAOO. TFW USPS puts the wrong country code in their system and send your package to the wrong part of the world yet still get to be like 'well u didn't send it insured for $40 more so go fuck yourself'. hnn like if you sell enough then the price is really different?...... I understand not promising it but I feel like you should at least try and then just refund/cancel orders and do the other way if you don't hit a goal that makes it possible financially. guh I forgot how much this feels like the energy and motivation have been drained out of me in an instant
I'm gonna. Go on a walk or something. OHHHH YOU WTACHI THIGNAbbbb?!!? I went out on Riot alone for the first time!! It was really nice and the bugs held off until after I swam too ! Dinner then work!!! Hnn that’s why I ask if you wanna do one or the other or either now bc I feel like it’s a bit awkward to ask for just merch unless that’s what the person wanted to do.. Welcome to  h e l l . Also tbh I’m pretty uncoordinated and I think I deserve a badge for getting in and out of that kayak 4 times without eating shit. Good boys!! I really love Shorter too, esp after this week’s episode I need to draw him too   I feel like he probably doesn’t get the love he deserves bc Other Good Boys. ...........OH NO... sNORT I WAS READING MANGA SO I READ IT THE WRONG WAY FIRST

Aaa yeah It's!! REALLY HARD TO FIND! I haven't found it any any book stores big or small - even comic/manga specialty ones...I really wanted to support a small store but in the end I guess I have to buy on Amazon ; n;. It's only in my library from volume 6 and up? so weird! WORSE sometimes parts would be missing bc they hecked up or were deleted. all I know about Banana Fish past the anime is that we get boys in Suits. LRT JRDFOGDFHFGHMM!!!! !!!

@grimmfirefly  do this. not-so-subtle "put-down" detected. Hdjdjd my mom and I we’re supposed to watch a movie and I was suooosed to draw but I felt shit and went to bed I feel so bad. Mood. I feel extra bad bc I told her I didn’t wanna sleep so wake me in an hour and FOR ONCE IN HER LIFE SHE ACTUALLY DID but I was so out of it I vaguely remember asking her a question and immediately rolling over and going back to bed. Omg I bet Penelope will be very popular too . (Butts in) I definitely want it too!! I realized a day after it closed like an idiot . Me: oh it’s Saturday Boku no hero
Me: .....
Me: u stupid—-

(I literally just watched it yesterday how am I this wrong). Aaa yes! I definitely need a mailing list   I’m too forgetful otherwise..
I’ll keep my eyes peeled!!  I know shipping is a lot of work (on top of having made the whole book!!) so — good job!! SOMME DUMBASSSS let the son in law and daughter of the developer into the fb group where the town is rallying against the project....FOOLSNSNNDBDCBn “I kno he’s related but I really trust him” - random dude who lives on a fancy street far away from the project.

Me: phew, I can finally rest 
Me: (obsessively checking application dates). Me: going out and laying on the dock and stuff..it just feels so lazy
Mom: it’s calling /relaxing!/ It’s good for your health. I’m feeling so called out but she didnt join me again so she’s just as bad. anyway I'm side-eyeing the library so hard rn they only have vol 6-10, they've been checked out for weeks, and it won't allow me to even /request it/ for when they're done. my wallet and i are feeling so attached rn. *ATTACKED THO IM ALSO ATTACHED, I GUESS. dfgdg thank you misty!! I just tend to get migraines from reading too much manga online so I prefer paper when I can;; > n< but ..you could..throw it my way..and maybe to @pukaparade  who is reading really ugly scans LOL idk if its the same haha. PHEW I'm pretty much caught up on packages /lays down forever. Once school starts I'm gonna switch to shipping out on one or two specific days a week!! haha wow ok gonna do that now bc school starts in. a week and a half. hahahaohgodhelp. me for days: hnn I just wanna draw but I have to get all this other stuff done first..
me, having finished most of the non-drawing responsibilities, w a long list of things to draw: .....(not opening photoshop, sweating)....maybe I..missed something.......... I h8 pantones. > I stayed up til 4 even tho I was tired at 9
> I worked on art I kept pushing off for a long while
> not sure how to feel LOL. I live the weeb life and she’s along for the ride. LRT I hate it I need this right now. *~Just artist alley things~* When they say the map is attached but it isn’t. Time before follow up email: 14 minutes

((maybe not that I /read/ those kinds of things but that they..exist.........)). Ugly enamel pins make me so sad 
Like I’m no expert, I’m not saying I make the most beautiful pins in the world —- 
but I’m talking about traced designs that are just carbon copies with no thought given for the medium and then filled w glitter in every cavity . Hnn yeah I remember a kickstarter running the same time as mine that was all traced and was like 500% funded or smth . I’m so offended by them TBH. I knew you’d appreciate this post
PS I saw your posts gushing abt @SachinTeng  and I 1000% agree!! Pin goals right there. YEA. And it’s like wow u had the abilities to do all this - making the design in adobe whatever and picking Pantones and suppliers and $ and everything and yet this is what u do w that power?! USE YOUR POWERS FOR GOOD U FOOL. IT ISN’T ACCEPTABLEEEEEEE   It’s really commonplace tho..sometimes it’s random companies but sometimes it’s artists .both are bad. thesE Awful

My doc sent me a robocall FIVE DAYS BEFORE MY APPT OF COURSE I DIDNT REMEMBER FIVE WHOLE DAYS LATER I am a goldfish why the heck was it so far in advance. SOMEHOW MITCH ALWAYS BEING THEIR WAITER NEVER GETS NOT FUNNY. I drew a gear shaped one too but this kiri turned out way cuter LOL. Aaaa good job!!! . Ohh I just remembered a friend I had..we only hung out with him once..I think we met at a party(?!) but I’m not sure whose. Anyway, he was also Jewish, he kept asking my friend and I for a threesome only half-joking, and he tried on high heels at a fancy place in the mall.. We were maybe 15 or 16..He called my innocent (compared to my friend) and my friend laughed bc she knew even tho I hadn’t done anything I have a dirty mind.. I met a lot more people and had weirder experiences in high school than now bc of few but very extroverted friends.. Now that good friend isn’t my friend anymore, joey’s kinda withdrawn now, and my other close friends are pretty introverted. Hmm. JUST MUSING, SORRY TWITTER. Pfff heh I’m glad you enjoy it. SO.. I THINK PIN CLUB..WILL PROB  LAUNCH SEPT 2nd>>............... IM EXCITED BUT NERVOUs /lays down. lmfaoo I'm glad but.

LRT THIS IS THE WINTER VACATION MOVIE I HAVE THIS VHS. 4 people. Craftland makes me so frustrated.

And they never reply to submissions and charge u $20 to apply to their holiday fair and Djfndjdn annoying. Like I get it - not having time to reply to everyone - but I still find it frustrating...but the fee to help cover extra costs for the fair like? I get it SORT OF but you’re the ones choosing to run it and as a result get more $ from sales there so..? . Everyone’s just tryna make it but charging artists for a maybe is shitty. A lot of contests are like this  http:// too.like    what you’re weeding people out to sort out the riffraff or smth? Sure it’ll make people who aren’t serious drop but also SKILLED POOR PEOPLE U FUCKERS. LMFAOO A GOOD TWEET.

Aaa I wanna learn to use the riso machine but the print people were kinda mean last time so I’m watching and reading tutorials so I don’t have to bother them a lot . There were two words that didn’t even have a space between them . HNN THERE'S a really pretty cosplay I want but there's no way to know which place that's using the photos actually made it and they all just bs photoshop their watermark on top I Hate THSIsss it's so pretty wth. 12 y/o me would combust if I owned this. it'd make some hell of a glow up photo too LOL.

When All Might goes we’re Done For   TWIST FATE TOGETHER. Cady all day: My stomach hurts help help help 
Cady: (won’t swallow this fucking pill no matter what I do). Ahhh you’re right! Then he was the only *hero* to die..I think there were civilians in Kamino maybe..and yeah villains taking out each other like dumb butts. LMFAOOO she is a dog that likes to eat a lot of grass. (Eyes glaze over) my uncle keeps asking my mom to loan him thousands of dollars and go in on sketchy business deals w him....he got half the money when my grandma’s house sold what did he possibly do with it. OHH IT LOOKS REALLY CUTE!  ; n; I hope you feel better soon. wow. these are really powerful and well-done.. we need to start a support group ...maybe 2 (one for anime-onlies and one for Those Who Have Seen All). Good news! She eventually got the pill down, stopped panting and pacing and fa..rt.ing.....and drank water, ate a lil bit, and is now resting u vu. I low-key tweeted before but I’ll be shipping out once weekly on Fridays now! pic.twitter.com/eodb6O2Nm0. for some reason this door that's $300 everywhere else was $20 at this particular lowe's location so my mom bought it but she's SO SKEPTICAL LMFAOO I told her to ask if it came already broken-. I got excited and thought they had Chat Noir but it was just a yellow power ranger . Hnn he’s saying red power rangers for boys and yellow for girls and I’m like that sounds real fake buddy but ok. I was nice tho and just said ok bc he was nice but then he looked again without prompting and gave me Alya and a drink for free . I mean errrr Réna Rouge! OH CRAP REALLY CAUSE I. I’M HAPPY BUT... I WANT CHAT TOO...at least Mari won’t be lonely anymore   . Ps which fan account should I tag? I only follow one general one but it’s official now I think. Aaa thanks Angie!! I will   It was so easy to tell you’re responsible for these cuties! Hehe. OHHH NICE!! . ALYA WAS THE ONLY OTHER ONE I WANTED BUT I was really looking for Chat LOL First he handed me the yellow power ranger like 'I nailed it' and I was just like uhhh. oh god my notifs are gonna be blowing up forever uh Hey check out my soundcloud.

I mean it's not expensive as far as cosplay goes but. lmfaoo there's been a fly in here on and I told her to just give up but cady is now borking softly at it. Can u believe I’m literally commissioning someone to draw 3 happy boys bc today’s episode broke me. Mood. LRT except I literally do call my brother big brother or bro or big bro sometimes . HAHA IT DEFINITELY DOESNT i know three people who have read it and they all say it only gets worse   I just started reading so I haven’t gotten past the point of the anime  yet. I finished a drawing but I hate how it came out . Aaa wait did u read the manga?? No spoilers! :O. Aaa ok . He put a chunk in a thing he can’t touch for 10 years 
Peak dumbass. HNNN THIS IS VERY TRUE. Lately I can’t sleep   I keep getting 3-5 hours I’m so tired I never make it to drawing and if I do then it’s shitty cause I’m out of energy djfnfnf. I’m yelling—. LMFAOO IM SORRY JEANINI we are suffering so badly we gotta just churn out misleadingly happy bright fun fan art or we will perish. Lol yeah but he just buys lots of cars and took all his kids and their SOs to Disney (that’s 9 people!!!). Ok I treated myself to two things so I’m gonna hold off on the cosplay u nu it’s not like I have any cons coming up that it’d be ready for anyways...even tho..it’s REALLY PRETTY HAHA. LMFAOO michaels is like this too sometimes.. it didn’t say anything weird so we went for it! Guess we’ll find out when we go to get it   Can always return it if it’s really messed up or smth. My saline was recalled. How do u ...mess up saline. Smith tells me Monday will be full of Kiri wrapped in thorns lmfao. Also Shinsou x Kaminari art I can’t believe this won’t be a rarepair. NOICE confirmed getting some good good trio merch from Anna..I’m so excited to see what she makes   If y’all are ever looking for custom hand drawn pins then I cannot recommend her enough.

the present mic is amazing tooaaa. This sounds like a very tricky but interesting concept :O. No worries! There are two options, both are $20. One is a slightly damaged copy of the zine with 1 random piece of bundle merch - 20 available. The other option is the set of the bundle merch: 2   buttons, acrylic pin, acrylic charm, + sticker sheet -but there’s only 3! SORRY I DIDNT REALLY ANSWER YOU HAHA the answer is no the zine is not included in the full merch set one. Photo of me trying to hold myself together at the start of the school year pic.twitter.com/cbPHiwWr7n. Good luck!! hnn i'm tempted to pack up some kiri zines right now but what if no one buys them online then I gotta cut em back open.. LMFAO IM SURE PEOPLE WILL BUY BUT --. LRT THIS IS SO CUTE but it got me thinking -- while I can picture him having friends like Kiri and Kaminari  I cannot picture Shinsou being part of the Baku squad so i'm curious to see what friendships + dynamics occur... OHH I LIKE THIS!! Kinda quiet purple kids? Tokoyami too?? yes!! right now he's too busy taking notes LOL. Oh this means not only is he a douche but he’s also wrong 

LMFAO NO but romantic or not canonically they’re very close but MORE IMPORTANTLY that doesn’t even matter and he can fuck right off b y e.

New neighbor: what grade are you in?
Me, gruffly: I’m an adult. (Kidding obviously I just said oh I’m in college). When people forget kiri’s scar I always wonder if it’s rude or not to point it out to them. I know when I forget it I want to be informed,m. LRT yeah whatever y’all are yelling about just shhhhhhh. Oh turns out BOTH my nasal sprays got recalled guess l just die.

The signs are cool but they definitely lead my eye away.. gUhh guess I should go pack some zines (eyes glaze over). DGSFDFH PEOPLE ARE REALLY...DEMANDING REFUNDS BC ITS TOO DOODLE-Y??? that is peak entitlement. isn't this, like, a look?! (more than ok?!). I sketched a really cute design for the third anniversary of Miraculous ...pls give me the strength to finish it sometime soon and also 5000 other things.  yes!! Patterned socks!! I don’t know if there’s a better feeling than doing 1 thumbnail and just being like “this is it”. Good luck!! . Aaa good luck! LRT panel one I like the lil lines on his teeth they look like braces and it’s really fucking cute ok fight me. Holy shit. You can cross this off your bucket list. IM LMFAOOO ohmygod We're rewatching some old BNHA episode and--

Shigaraki is doing the thing where he's scratching at himself and my mom just goes,
"God, buddy, you and your eczema..". NDDJDJ my mom literally googled it and was like “I’ll tell you what Kind of cream he needs—“ . pic.twitter.com/Pd919LHpiw. When you like the doodle better than the finished illustration . hnn color troubles today. As someone who crawled out of bed@3 I'm really feelin this tweet ; n; I hope you feel better soon...and SEE YOU SOON! sgfsdg someone wrote me a long message about reprinting the zine...like it was a very nice message but..please.. I'm...so tired............. TT  A  TT. Like I didn’t do the final math yet but we raised prob $7k can I FUCKING REST YET . UNLESS IM GETTING PAID I---. WHAT KIND OF WEEKEND IS THIS FOR YOU GUYS Jesus /wraps u in a blanket and wraps ur display in Saran wrap. Hnn I’m sorry you’re feeling this way..breaking down isn’t fun but sometimes you really just need to let it out. I hope you feel better soon . “I used ‘great’ twice, I hate myself” - my mom, while writing an email

You see where I get my burgeoning self confidence. Those things where you draw on the screen (cintiq?) vs a regular tablet. Uh all my friends and peers with horror stories from diff cons this weekend —- the hell is going on??

Attendees! Please!! Treat artists with respect!! Don’t hate on what they choose to draw, don’t spill your shit, don’t steal, don’t try to underpay them, etc!!! Hnn I’m so curious..I wonder if my school has one I can rent or smth to try it. Like we came here to make friends and money I don’t need to hear your essay on why you don’t like a character or pair or series or whatever that’s clearly all over my table?? Like are you having fun doing that?? Isn’t it more fun to talk about things you LIKE? Advice on what to tell customers w jump ring problems? I’ve never really had this other than the occasional snide comment about Bakugou (disagree but can’t blame them) or Ochako (disagree, they are wrong) but YEAH YIKES like you can tell I like the thing why are you like this. Ohh! it's an important factor for me for sure..certain positions I hurt a nerve in my arm..not carpal tunnel but ouchie ; n; 
I'm really bad tho I sit on the couch and draw on my tablet as it is.. Ohh I wasn't aware it was so clunky ; n; 
That's for the tip! this is so . weird.................... I guess they were really desperate?... SERIOUSLY WHAT HELL ARE YOU TWO FACING THIS WEEKEND HOW MANY PEOPLE DO I HAVE TO FIgHT?? Jdjdjdjdjd it kills me when I ask again “which one” and they just keep going “THIS ONE” LIKE I CANNOT SEE PLEASE USE YOUR WOOIRDSSSSohmtnffjf. Idjdjdjdbi really hope I get into that bf zine HNNN. This is a foreign feeling I haven’t applied for a zine in like???????????????? Over 6 months??? And his legs... It feels so amazing when I have packages to pack since Saturday but bc of the holiday nothing will move til Tuesday. All leftovers kiri zine orders are packed!! everyone: posting pics and gushing about potat/occ/lan's doujin
my dumb ass who realized a day after preorders closed:  

oi oi someone lend me your copy at a con or something so I can read it quickly + I'll throw you merch? TT A TT not that I really have any cons coming up.. I accidentally made plans on my grandma’s birthday and I feel so bad   My mom is gonna be..so sad..and alone . I’ve been making so many dumbass moves lately dhdbdnd. RIP US
She even messaged me when she put up leftovers and I ignored it without looking at my phone bc I was watching anime and like 10 min later they were gone. PEAK dumbass. OHH IS THIS THAT GIRL (I forgot her name Djfndjdn). YESSS. Cady doodles! pic.twitter.com/7ETvWdkbr4. TFW YOU FINALLY BUILD YOURSELF UP TO BUY SMTH AND YOUR SIZE IS OUT. Banana fish doodles from the other day  pic.twitter.com/IQHTD65Leu. !!! AAA CONGRATS SUNNY   Wishing you and quick and painless recovery . Idk if non-Jews will get this joke but I’m gonna go for it pic.twitter.com/zcbm5TXN5M. I’m so scared I started the manga and I know it’s gonna hurt. WAIT WHAT WHERE WHAT. LMFAOO I FOUND OUT FROM U CAUse the mention on my name is broken and I didn’t get an email   THANK U FRIEND. Oh believe me I will   first I have to find the volume I buried under a mountain of clothes .. Asfsehtdh I need to catch up on Adventure Time A LOT now that it's over ; n;. Relatable I just watched soul eater this year. Miss cadence threw up :( I’m worried about her and her little tummy... Me too :( she was doing better so I think she just ate a grass/plant she shouldn’t have when I left her outside for five minutes orz. Ngl I wanna see this team up. Hnn I had the weird kind of dreams where I’m having trouble sorting out what really happened and what I dreamed cvvbbb. LMFAOO I FUCKING HATE THIS . Ugh, /definitely/ cigarettes. Can’t believe they actually let my ass into this show this year..now I get to decide if I want the fun new pressure of this show and trying to scrounge together a bunch of books or smth fuck. Ugh what weird violent sleep tho I woke up once with all my covers gone (and there’s A lot - top sheet, blanket, comforter, 2 blankets), another time w my shirt half off, another with my pillow on the other side of the bed?! Combining your twitter name w thisnpost makes me feel like “your fave is a worm on a string” needs to be a thing. screams into the abysss
i hate
pantones. W h a t. Catception. hello art friends i cnanot post this drawing pls dm me help me pick color. @ pukaparade  @mistysmistakes  LMFAO CAN I SHOW U Two or you just like that I’m pantone suffering. (eyes glaze over)
I saw a major banana fish spoiler
they even marked it spoiler but scrolling in sheets is so jumpy that I saw it anyway hghfdhg fuck. THAKN YOU.............did you apply? :(. Customer: this is my address 
USPS: this is an address
USPS: pic.twitter.com/jj82hRu2qO. How can they have it confirmed in their system as a registered address and then turn around and do me like this . The supervisor was like yeah idk send it again so Here we go. Djfndjdn I’m sorry friend :( we never get into the same things.. Fated to be apart .. LMFAOOO. I returned to get my backpack that I left at the restaurant within 5 mins and they’re like we need to see an ID and I’m like ok well it’s in. My backpack. . P much. This is so deep. LMFAOO. I love seeing all these fan arts and love letters to Adventure Time..its making me so nostalgic.. The friends who I used to watch it with are no longer in my life but I really want to watch it in its entirety now!! I CAME /bACK TO LOOK@ THIS AGAIN bc the way you draw them is? So good? wth? Especially Nejire's face and hair are so amazing/. OH NO on banana fish days I’ll have class from the time it comes out until like 9:30 at night fuuuck. I wanna eat chocolate but I’m too tired 
Zzzzzzzz. I just wanna dye my hair pastel pink/purple (which I continue to lust after and never acquire) but too much of it is too orangey/mid tone ndndndndbf it won’t take like that but bleaching it again is a pain, bad for my hair, and expensive. Me@1 am: I need to start going to bed earlier (sleeps)
Me@4 am: awake, sweating after fits of waking shortly a few times and feeling very confused
?!?! WTFFF THIS IS SOOOOOO CUTE. I sure do love that school is starting Thursday. The guy putting up tiles is like...he stops each time to cut one single tile and it seems way less convenient and more time consuming than just waiting and cutting all the ones he needs to cut at the end or at least in small groups or smth. It’s prob the last possible beach day hot enough to swim but I’m so tired hhh. THE TILE GUY IS LISTENING TO SOME LIKE LITERALLY ALEX JONES LEVEL SHIT i'm fucking HRRGRGeg 
When we have people working on stuff I purposefully don't put on political stuff so the fuck is this. (internal screaming). My face rn. Oh did I mention my ex is reading 50 shades 
. Me: I don’t even want ice cream I’ll get it to go
Me: may as well have /a taste/
Me: (eats 80% of the ice cream before leaving the parking lot). get the nachos bruh
I'm very plain, soft steak/beef tacos for me.. Grrrr since I’ve been going part time I’m taking a freshie class and they changed half the colors of gouache they give freshman so now I have to go drop mad $ because I have aquamarine blue and not aquamarine DEEP blue . I also don’t have black bc my school is so stupid they gave us no black and two tubes of the same white. Wtf that’s such a cute concept (also this is great!!). AAA ITS SO GOOD I HOPE YOU ENJOY IT. Yeah I’m not bringing shit to class tomorrow. /pats you
We don’t /know/ that.....there’s just 2000 characters they’ll make first... is2g if they ever make Mineta I’m flying to japan to beat someone up. Prof clearly didn’t read my email right and her reply is totally fucked in grammar did she write this half asleep...anyway guess I have to bring a bunch of crap today even tho no one else will have it and we won’t use it
I really don’t wanna get up early to try to find blocks. Anyways I love waking up every day to this fucking far right radio show please end me. My anxiety screams be prepared but my brain is like no one else is gonna bring all that today don’t worry. lmfao I follow the girl TAing this class on insta . May be too late but GOOD LUCK. This schedule is so packed..I’m in the baby one tho (soph+juniors vs juniors + seniors) so she said she may slow it down a bit. Why is yoga the most stressful class rn. My brain is so overwhelmed. 8 hours straight of HERes EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO DO IN THE NEXT THREE MONTHS. Me: I’ll get out between 9 and 9:30 so I’ll miss the train 
Mom: ok I’ll get there at 9

9:00
Me: (out)

9:40
Me: (still fucking sitting here). I don’t not appreciate her picking me up it’s just like don’t. Say things you don’t mean. When you know today was rough for me too. I just wanna crawl in bed. (Same - it’s ok if not tho! I heard of someone like this so I’m curious if it’s the same or different..). Today is the kind of day where when my hair tie got tangled when I tried to take it out I just left it. It’s just been in my hair for like two hours now I can’t deal w it right now. Im not even watching banana fish
Goodnight. Bc of ASMR I sometimes subconsciously tap on things that way when I hold them..I don’t even love tapping that much. I’m trying to avoid banana spoilers so anytime I see colored blobs that look vaguely like The Boys I SCROLL REAL FAST. LATE HAPPY BDAY NANA!!! yesterday these girls were talking about how some people dress like “if u dress that way u have to take the bad attention too” + I was thinking I hope y’all are freshman like who said anyone was dressing any way for attention in the first place?! Maybe they just - oh I don’t know - like those clothes   aesthetically? Feel good in them? also no one deserves to be harrased - esp not for the way they dress - please grow up quickly kids we don’t need that shit on campus. Then in yoga class this lady was upset that her health card said vaccinations are good? Like using yoga and holistic methods to help with anxiety/depression/aches/etc - great!! Awesome! But you can’t holistically protect your kids from getting the mumps..she has kids too.. Anyway those were my frustrations for the day LOL back to bed now.. sefgdh it's waterpark con east but it's so cold this weekend? Please prepare better for these than you did for the Yuri! on Ice pop ups...I know lots of people were disappointed back then.. LMFAOOO ok i'm watching banana fish  now
I love how  he doesn't even have a name they just keep calling him 'the next presidential candidate' over and over. ohh i guess they really are 'modernizing' it? he just said Iraq vet instead of Vietnam.

VERY RELATABLe.. I feel too guilty for 'wasting' daylight u nu so instead I wait til I'm too tired to function---.  THIS PHRASE HAS BEEN USED TWICE NOW..........
I got really fired up about this a couple months back so I hope our hard work pays off!  thank you friend. Y’all it’s so cold I’m wearing sweatpants today , don’t fight me. Oh no this is very good. Even though I don’t really ship it romantically..the relationship between Deku and Bakugou and it’s development is clearly so important to the story and gives me lots of feels. Yes!! And like from the one where they fight All Might it’s clear that they’re meant to learn to work together to accomplish amazing things.. HNNNN. Yes?! I feel like they’ll never be buddy buddy but like..mutual respect and a closeness from being childhood friends and their like..bakugous instincts and dekus quick planning?! A good combo!!!! Yes!! They’re definitely not meant to stay in a stagnant state..it’s changing already, this fight being a good example. Well, I’ve officially lost count of how many times he’s been in the ER this year. LRT so tired I’m just retweeting my friend...same. i've been tired for like
4 days. @ chriseatscandy  @DarkGreyClouds. omg I got an email about this attack on titan sticker on red bubble being taken down — I literally make no sales there so I forgot it existed — but anyway they said I also infringed on dragon ball with it somehow?? LMFAO IT’S LITERALLY JUST EREN’S HEAD. It said “Dragon Ball, Attack on Titan” ???? LMFAOO we don’t belong to a temple and my mom wants to go for Yom Kippur and she’s like “if we pretend to wanna join they’ll let me go the service” and I’m like “isn’t that..a sin..”   (Yom Kippur is the holiday of atoneing for your sins). Can you believe it’s September 10th and I put the heat on. I’m so fucking weak. Rip. Me: paranoid, literally emailing ahead of time to ask about pricing and formatting since this method isn’t outline like every other one
This guy: this shit. Yeah but like..it’s YOUR time you’re devoting to translating so you can have your focus on whatever you want! I don’t think you’ve been misleading at all and in fact I’ve often seen you clarify that “whether kiribaku was romantic or platonic, their relationship blah blah” yknow? It’s not like you’re preaching THIS IS IT THE ONLY SHIP AND THEYRE CANON!! And I understand it’s upsetting if people are using your translations to hate on or harrass others so I think it’s great that you addressed it but other people’s actions aren’t your responsibility. I think there’s just uh a lot of people who are new to all this and want you. to be problematic when you’re just doing your best and putting your time and energy into translating things you’re happy about and want to be accessible to other fans. And I think that’s really lovely. JUST MY TWO CENTS..keep up the great work, haters gonna hate LOL   (also hi Gaby I should have untagged  you maybe,.sorry HAHA). I just took the chill off..I started sneezing anyhow . Yeah I just meant the pretending she was interested so she could go that one day but not having any real intention LMFAO (we’re not really poor like when I was young but in my opinion this system is really inaccessible and unfair....). Ohmygoooodd the AC was so strong in there all weekend I swear my fingers were numb at one point just let me have this. @ pukaparade. YESS I WAS NICE SEEING Y’ALL  I’m also broken and.. still in bed LOL. No. I think that must be it honestly Djfndjdn I’m so
Tired. Gdndndn the first one — with her little mouth open?! So cute? So fierce?? Hello it should not be 100 degrees and then barely above 50 degrees I would like my money back September. me, on a project that matters not at all: wow I fucking NAILED this
me, the rest of the semester, probably: (SCREAMING). My mom is flipping out. I need one day. Just one fucking day to relax. like I asked why she was getting so worked up and then she screamed at me about having trouble closing this account for like  a full five minutes so i left. (Calling around, Trying to find a specific brand of paint)
Employee: it doesn’t /sound/familiar 
Me: .....ok..
I thought maybe they’d idk /check/ or /look/??? Sure do love living nowhere bc the nearest are supplies store is 20 mins away and it’s literally double the cost of the stores in Boston . I didn’t wanna spend $50 so I sure as hell don’t wanna spend $100 . i'm..i'm gonna give it another chance but i'm feelin so cynical about yoga class ; n; i dont want to but i do. If I said this hasn’t literally been my whole day I’d be lying pic.twitter.com/hCUhHcLRMV. Guuuuhh Alarm for a JURIED con woke me from napping. I love this restaurant in that they're consistent - They consistently don't give us what we asked for. (this tweet is a joke, this place is our go-to for delivery they just forget the dressing every single time. Even when my mom tells them they forgot it last time LMFAOO). me: I love helping people!
brain: but if you tell this person they'll tell their friends that person will tell their friends and then you'll never get into this con you love ever again. FDHIGDFH THAT'S TOO FAR, BRAIN! There's a couple people I feel like are nice to me, but only because they want something so I just keep a distance from people like that. u nu. ugh!! I hate when people edit wikis with unfounded stuff :( If there was an official confirmation of something like that, I'm sure we'd all know that way. OMG I ALMOST FORGOT ABOUT THIS..................I've become so skeptical so I looked further into it but I was still disappointed ; n;. hnn I feel that way a lot of the time too.. <3. I got a really satisfying random pull for this assignment pic.twitter.com/oZfIdSZFHZ. This weekend @pukaparade  informed me that Ash Lynx is canonically afraid of pumpkins and I haven't stopped thinking about it ever since. I’m still not feeling good and you can tell bc I just drew four scar-less Kirishimas. Every once in a while I pretend I have the skill and perseverance to draw a comic and I just made a tiny doodle draft but it reads from right to left cause I’m a weeb w a fucking headache. Update I still feel crappy ..I was REALLY cold all day and my mom was like Jennie are you getting sick and now I’m thinking maybe fccvvbggc. Oh no this works really well . I feel like I should have to say this but since I do: Please don’t ask artists to draw over other artists work. It’s disrespectful to both of the artists and also is a lawsuit waiting to happen.. Ugh I should be leaving now but I’m still in bed. Which means i probably don’t get to eat before 5 straight hours of classes.. My throat hurts and I have to give a presentation today .too. Why this. Tbh I hope this is me next week. Good job making a decision that’s right for you . Hnn I forgot there’s a lot of non art students in color theory for some reason and the guy next to me was clearly stressed out   he kept looking over at me and he accidentally put orange in the wrong spot on the color wheel..in good news tho I’m feeling marginally better. However the bottom of one of my paint tubes split open and got everywhere. I was like WHAT HAPPENED I WAS SO CAREFUL   (I tend to be kinda messy but screen printing helped  ). pic.twitter.com/KhJXuYQkJr. What else? . I feel like this chapter title will resonate pic.twitter.com/SINXYnjEdd. This is so precious. Am I really gonna try this ridiculous new product type . Stop me. Hjdjsjdjd my mom was super pissy again this morning and again tonight can she. Stop. I felt shitty and still went to school..joey fucking relapsed again,. i just want to relax.. people started arguing on my AANI post so I deleted it. ah, facebook.
Someone made a post asking what a good easy A course is at their college and someone just goes "Art?"
  you fool............... Someone wanted to commission me to draw over someone else's work so I asked for help in explaining to them why that's a No from me, then people started arguing over copyrights/whether or not that was transformative enough/etc (eye roll) what else.. hnn feeling up and down all day but sore throat is Persisting I literally had a cold at Flame like 2 weeks ago..body..please......... instead of anything i have to do i drew smth stupid i'llshowy'all later.. this is gonna be a stupid ass sticker. dfsgdih that's awrful!! like "cool thanks for your opinion i didn't ask for"   I remember being so happy at finding that group in 2014 and now i'm like "..this hellish landscape". a bunch of animals . everyone in that group needs to Chill Out u nu. https://www. youtube.com/watch?v=-lA1Qt shvKU&index=17&list=RDSiY9Fc73hkk   …. I didn’t know I needed this. Aaaa this is so impressive!!   you’re so strong!! Can you not  
(Great work tho!!!  ). aaa I really hope somehow horikoshi hears about the guy who saved someone while wearing an All Might shirt..... I can't believe Bakugou and Kirishima are making such /faces/ in the hiking set?! We have been ROBBED. pic.twitter.com/qGJ6G1X9jB. I’d say so! Omg. My heart !!!!!! LRT im gonna buy the fuck out of this zine. I didn’t sleep deeply at all and woke up 1-2 times each hours = n=. Busy busy!! Guh I’m just a Little sick and I’m worried bc my last cold (2 freaking weeks ago) came on really slowly exactly like this and I always get sick right when school starts and often fuck up bc of it. I took a nap cause I was too tired to do anything and now I’m groggygggggg. anyway Ash and Eiji are both pretty bratty and it's very cute. PS Y'all I lied about GSCC being my last show of the year- 

I'll be at the  Ladies Con  in Somerville, MA on September 22nd!
This show has a focus on women, non-binary, LGBT+, and POC creators and is FREE TO ATTEND!

Hope to see ya there! More Info@ http:// ladiescon.com   pic.twitter.com/HTY6XLxqcK. MM I wanted to hand out a special sticker@Two Heroes subbed premiere in Boston but idk what to draw for it
Also I have no time
Also idk what to draw. Yeah, I think perfect bound is a good idea for that number of page. Not sure where you're looking at, but jic - smartpress tends to have good pricing! \o/ I will for sure buy one!! OHMMYGOD This city with a large Jewish pop. moved their 9/11 ceremony to the next day bc it coincided with Rosh Hashanah and this ignorant fuck goes "Why not change Rosh Hashanah because of 9/11" (looks into camera). guhh the finished project is due Tuesday but we're having like part-way done crit tomorrow and she was super vague about how far along to be?? she was just like 'the more you have done, the more we can give you feedback on' DGJHfgh I wanna..stop working on this for now.... pic.twitter.com/DpS6vvTcdC. also might as well take general crit/feedback from y'all too ? \ o /. assignment: make patterns and apply them over a photo of performers, juniors/seniors also put patterns on the set
me, w freshman credits status: hand draws the characters, makes a set, barely makes any fucking patterns, which was the actual assignment. first look: wow!! those wallet designs * Q* 
second look: WAIT I HAVE SOME OF THESE THINGS--
Can I bother you for what the little toys are called? Yes!! Thank you <3. G...GOOD LUCK!!

I also had a 'where can I see your art online' question on the first day of class and I was v close to panicking and just writing WHAT'S THE INTERNET instead. my friend told me that this artist I really admire is actually kind of awful as a person and
that sucks

not too much else to say bout it just IT SUCKS. me: there's no way your professor even took the time to look at it, let alone took the time and energy to follow it to your twitter and look at what kind of content you post and retweet
also me: she's here and she knows /EVERYTHING/. HNN IT HASN'T HAPPENED TO ME TOO MUCH BEFORE.....FEELS BAD MAN

I also............own a few shirts from them and now I'm just gonna frown down at myself all day RLDSFGMDH. @ pukaparade. when my friend told me ash was afraid of pumpkins this weekend I made them go on the wiki bc I genuinely thought they were just fucking with me

Thank you for creating this content. I'm just trying to imagine - being from New England - MA specifically - and wondering how he survived October here as a kid?! PUMPKINS. EVERYWHERE. Someone reposted my art pretending they drew it - is this the big leagues?  

But really if you’re reading this..your other accounts seem like genuinely your drawings? Improving your art+growing your fan base is a pain but it will be way more worth it so. Don’t b like this LOL. Ugh couldn’t sleep.nose/throat issues .gonna try to do the thing where I start but tell myself I can go home whenever. The problem with this is that my classes go from loose to strict in ascending order   (2x a week but he said he won’t fail for attendance, 2x a week, 1x a week). I’m so stuffy   I can’t believe I’m sick again it’s been two weeks I’m so fucking. DJFNJDDNDN you spoiled me so much with my kiri package that I had to return the favor   I’m so glad it all arrived safely~~~ I know you’ll take good care of the boys . It’s my third time as an artist too!! See ya there! Oh. I’m actually pretty good at mixing colors. Like, I knew this but I feel really validated in this class LMFAOOO like sure some are better but there’s also a lot of psych students so they’re more off. Perfect? No. Good enough? Heck yeah. pic.twitter.com/JB8sPlC88t. I know a lot of people who follow me are from the area so to all y’all affected by the gas explosions/fires..please please be safe - evacuate, listen to emergency responders, etc. . UNACCEPTABLE... Ok without spoiling anything, can y’all tell me how stressful today’s episode of banana fish is on a scale of 1 (beach episode) to 10 (all your faves die)? LRT I FOUND THIS OUT THIS PAST WEEK AND IT BLEW MY MIND. WAIT REALLY HOLY SHIT. If you’re lying I’ll cry. Ohmygod ok I’m so excited!! Thank you for telling me!! I’m downloading it now :3 c. I WILL MY HEART IS RACING ALREADY HAHA. w..WAITTT WHO WAS THAT
At THE END

ready to be rid of the O r a n g e I never asked for. dGFSDHFH I was like 'ok clearly they're up to smth cause one of ash's guys is pretending to be drunk' but I thought they were just like communicating in secret not ABOUT TO STAB A GUY jesus dfsgdfh. my yoga prof calls three different kinds of assignments 'journals' so there was a solid 20 mins of class today of various students asking the same questions over and over and her trying to explain and and i was just dfgndhgfh 
IM A VERY IMPATIENT PERSON. i'm impatient for real it's a bad trait of mine.. I just wanted to stand up, tell everyone to SHHHh, outline it very clearly so the students understood what was what and so the prof understood WHY people were confused, mic drop, leave. LMFAOO can't believe the shanking happens now + not when characters were in jail. Ow. Everything hurts. This better be from yoga and not from this cold I apparently have Bc if I have the flu I’m gonna flip. Out. The real question is is kiris favorite color red BECAUSE bakugous outfit is red or is bakugou more attractive bc kiris fave color was already red. Based on the forecast it’s also looking like the last time to SWIM this weekend bsdjjdndd. i feel like these results were pretty accurate LOL https:// twitter.com/cambrasine/sta tus/1040455545491214337   …. aaaa Wish I was attending!!

Aaa this is really kind of you   It’s hard to see what they have ..it seems like a lot of blinds which I’m too much of a baby for   The Yuri on ice pop up shop was completely ravaged in an hour or two so if you’re going for yourself I’ll send good vibes your way!! Errrr ...well..I mean..some teenagers are more responsible than others for sure but...I was a Reaponsible teen and I wouldn’t have been prepared for the burden of time, dealing with financial aspects, etc at that age.......... Aaaa that’s so sweet of you!! Yes!! I have ita bags for Kiri and Deku :3 c They’re popular boys tho haha I hope you get the characters you want tho . Ohh I’m glad they instituted that bc I’m pretty sure that’s not how YoI NY pop up went   my friend got there two hours after it opened and there wasn’t nearly anything left ..it was supposed to be two weeks long dhnddjd. Jk she remembered my hair being lighter so now I get to come back in a few weeks instead of anything but cutting today orz  rip. You could take a semester off if you need to, or drop a couple classes to take the pressure off? :( I hope you can find a solution that works for you and feel better soon . Hnn yeah maybe :( Aaaa good luck!!   I hope you get all your faves!! Ohoho she’s got good taste!! A few of these look familiar too   This pic is a bit old but !! pic.twitter.com/GeAPAWSkQZ. My deku bag has more room. I love mirio and the big three too   I have a pile of merch for them that I hope to make into a bag sometime soon! I’m also craving official merch..soon...maybe HAHA.

Omg that would honestly really freak me out. This is good source material LMFAO. I think it’d be really good to juxtapose them w like little kids, happy to be eating a cupcake LMFAO. If I were an animation student rn—-. I had good Halloween charm ideas but I don’t have
Time. worse than banana fish. yeah!! Idk your whole situation but I know some people are hesitant to take longer to graduate but like..your physical and mental health are more important. A few extra months isn't a long time in the grand scheme of Your Life. i wish a*b would just admit prorow is juried now bc they're too lazy
Every since they complained that "judging the art contest took a whole day!" like of course it did?!
regular AA apps being lottery: ok, fine. prorow - the JURIED part of the AA - being a lottery: ???????? I know I didn't have to!! !I JUST WANTED TO sPOIL YOU LIKE YOU SPOILED ME ;) <3 <3 <3. yeah, they're cute!! ..I love how one's falling on todoroki's head LOL. hnn yeah that's what I heard. I was going to be heading back from PA that day so I was gonna stop there and I LITERALLY CRIED I was so disappointed. PONYTAIL KIRI: SPOTTED. snORT ohmygod you're right. OHH THEY're /GUSSETED/!!! LMFAOO These rich people are late to the anti-development party. This guy is like FORGET THE HOUSES LETS WORK W THE TOWN BUILD A SOLAR PANEL ENERGY FARM like the guy already bought the land bro u gotta catch UP. He then continues to say let's widen our street (which is privately owned by one of the people living here) and make a trail down to the pond (?! through whose land bro), etc.. orz that's . that's not the situation. Like GOOD IM GLAD YOU SPENT A DAY JUDGING IT bc those people put tons of hours into creating work for the contest!! I'm glad you didn't just throw a dart at a board!!! I just. for nearly $500 with no badges I want you to fucking look at the applicants, thanks. “We’re sorry for the inconvenience” - actual quote from the head of the gas company responsible for at least one death and 60-80 explosions and fires. 6TEEN. REUNION???SPECIAL??????????????????????????????/. me: WOW I LOVE 6TEEN
also me: why is this happening. it's been almost a week since joey transferred to the other rehab facility so I asked his mom what's up and she's like 'idk i'm waiting for them to call me' 
that's not
what i wanted to hear. I've been craving a donut for a week and my mom got me one yesterday. You think this is nice, right? Well, she didn't tell me she got me one and by this morning 3/4 of it were missing. Tha..nks?! . Hey hey I just sent a tip and it got me wondering..I don't do enough commissions to know what's standard so complete the sentence with this poll
"When I commission an artist, I...."

(Also, I know this may be case-by-case for some but in this scenario u had a positive experience). hnn it's so weird i feel like i have a cold in the mornings but once I get going I feel good? but then I crash really early? I got a full nights sleep and I've been ready for bed since 7:30.. It's been like 3-4 days of thisss. Someone give me the energy to build this in time for my next con pic.twitter.com/PEulpO4ir8. I don't think I have the craft foam skills to pull this off but I'm gonna TRY.
that's what he would want me to do :'). yeah my friend is having allergies like this now and I get spring allergies but..thing is it's bad@night + the morning (sinus issues worse laying down..) but during the day - the time that I'm actually outside - like literally I walked in the woods today - I feel fine? hnn if they're gonna do lottery I feel like they should still have SOME amount of screening or categories for variety (plush, knit, clay, cosplay, etc.)  like some other cons do. . this is my only reference and I h8 it pic.twitter.com/MzDaneOQFW. on top of how ugly it is just the concept --- you shouldn't be appeasing the monster. TT A TT THIS IS REALLY CUTe... pic.twitter.com/gTu9K0QxC4. to be fair so is the paper prototype i just made dgfdhgfh. me, drafting this kiri tip jar: I FORGOT HIS STUPID BDSM MASK. HES SO UGLY I CANT SORRY HAHA i'm trying a digital mock up instead.. I'm gonna try to go get foam tomorrow (eyes emoji). I love his stupid mask but it looks like A REAL PAIN IN THE ASS
I'm gonna make people vote then ignore the result like i always do--. my paper mock up was ugly af and based around a not clear container (which I realized at the end) so DIGITAL MOCK UP

MASK OR NO MASK VOTE IN REPLIES pic.twitter.com/98JcGQvEA7. Vote!! Images in OP. @ DarksStars. I really wanted to make him more like 3D but then I had to distort his face more and it wasn't as cute u nu. I'm also very charmed by it but YES as u said i'm also charmed by his SWEET FACE u nu 

. 
.
also it's a pain to draw srGODTRJHYF. hnn this is how i feel too.. YEP IM FEELIN REAL EXTRA RN. can we just take  a minute to admire how poorly I photoshopped that photo into him like it's all pixelated and shit i'm--. # v //ore #self /cest?  
I HATETHIStdrfhgj. PFFF ---
I LOVE IT, DON'T GET ME WRONG - I just thought the drawing looked cute w/o it but I wanna be accurate! look I know I have like 3 polls going right now but---

LRT AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA. Im sosososososoosoooo excited for today’s ep but I need more sleep to sleep off this stupid cold thing. Y i k e s :( glad everyone is ok..sorry you had such a stressful experience tho. If my dog or mom make me pause this episode I will lose my mind. I will take every precaution. (For reference my mom likes to watch w me but is always doing 1000 other things and somehow Cady always needs food or water or /attention/ during the 20 mins I want uninterrupted ). 20 mins is not that long but it’s always A Problem somehow  ....... !! Noo the latest ep of bnha is an emotional one but..I’ve been really looking forward to it honestly. Screen printing is time consuming but I think the results are more charming than digital. If you’re looking for someone to print for you my prof from last semester is part of trifecta editions or I’ve heard antidesigns, both around Boston Don’t have  experience as a customer tho. you’ve gotta be KIDDING ME!! Are people really doing this?! It’s not romantic at all and it’s super fucking important I’m beside myself . Hi if you’re doing this you should really not. It’s your life do what you want but just feel like I need to say it is not Romantic/Shippy at all, they’re literally fighting+yelling?! But it is INCREDIBLY important for character debelopment/the series. You’re missing out! https:// twitter.com/grovndzero/sta tus/1040979568625176576   …. I don’t ship them romantically either but I’ve been looking forward to this episode all season —- BC YES ITS ABOUT THEIR RELATIONSHIP but not in that way! In like “if these two work together”...WONDER.DUO. + just Bakugous character development on his own so.important. I haven’t watched it yet but I heard the animation and voice acting are amazing too. Honestly I’m gonna cry this week I can feel it. I’m so stuffy from the cold but I wanna watch it NOOOWWWWWW. SAMEE IM GONNA HAVE TISSUES WITH ME SO I DONT HAVE TO PAUSE TO GET THEM TBH. Small brain: everyone will love and appreciate Kirishima after his backstory episodes and internship arc

Galaxy brain: his merch is gonna get more expensive (again). Based on snippets I’ve seen they put their whole budget into the rescue and This scene and I am 100% ok w that. YESS SAME all season I’ve been WAITING - I even thought it was before the provisional license exam and was disappointed - and now I’m like oh god am I ready . THIS IS A REALLY GOOD TAKE @mairinette https:// twitter.com/mairinette/sta tus/1041002484041502721   …. (Slowly slides u a tissue box). (on instagram)
me: i was sick when I hit 2/2.25k so I'll do a giveaway for 2.5k

hnnn I wanna drop a class but like when if I had to score each class for ease and interest they all even outdfghfh. conspiracy theorist @DarksStars. I can't decide which orientation I prefer this design so I just keep flipping it horizontally and having to erase/redraw kiri's scar each time LOL. me, begging people to stop following me: pLEASE, ITS FOR MY HEALTH---. I really really have enjoyed it. I tried to make a google “Did you mean /milk crate/?” Image but it took too long to generate so now I’m writing this. I wish I was Not Sick and At SPX. My mom, asking about a bird that flew away: what kind was it?
Me: idk just plain, I think. I just had another terrible (great) idea. LMFAOO W H A T. They only had super thick black craft foam I feel so betrayed. IM GLAD YOU ENJOYED IT. I just want it on the record that I’m on board for kiribaku jealousy situations that work out well. Kirishima getting jealous that Camie made Bakugou laugh right away? Bakugou getting jealous of his past w Mina or thinking Inasa is SO MANLY? Yes, please. For clarification I mean scenarios where this is worked out quickly without anyone actually getting hurt or doing anything wild and in the end everyone’s friends anyway w no hard feelings. WOW both the idea and execution are b e a u t i f u l. Uhh sometimes when I have a cold I get a lot done but today I just felt
Bad
Headache
Soreness. (Whispers) couple..THOUSAND. It shines as brightly as his smile. Lmfaooo they’re trying. pic.twitter.com/UT5cG9OPGn. /VIBRATES I WANNA KNOWWW. I love and hate this https:// twitter.com/tsodmike/statu s/1041094230863687680   …. Alright never in my fucking life have I gotten a Torino’s ad online but five minutes ago i told my mom I haven’t had pizza rolls in a while and 

I’m sorry for some things there’s no other explanation than they’re LISTENIFNDNDNDHSBG pic.twitter.com/Uf8BdjupV5. i hate that I have to decide whether i wanna drop classes so quickly. because the options are QUIT NOW, make graduating even less realistic/less credits OR stay, may be fine or may be super stressed out for three months or I'll quit later and lose hundreds or thousands of dollars. three class meetings, one of which just being the syllabus/materials, is not enough time to figure out if I can keep pace without being CONSTANTLY thinking about 'what am i gonna do for this project'. alsomy school is stupid!!!! credits do not match the amount of time/work AT ALL. A class that meets once a week + a class that meets twice a week, both 2.5 hours long, can be the same amount of credits. 
meaning I could go to school 5 hours or 10 hours and get the same amount. (whispers) the system is Bad. there's not really someone to talk to bc my moms gonna say jenn i dont want you to be stressed out for three months and my bro's gonna say jenn just stay and do your best even if you don't get As in everything. Hnn I don’t wanna drop out bc Id feel really aimless and there’s still lots of classes I wanna take it’s just that I’ve been taking 2 classes but this time I wanted to try to do 3 but one is like JAM PACKED and fast paced and I don’t wanna be constantly thinking abt it. But it is smth I’m really interested in and the prof seems nice enough so it would feel like a waste to quit esp so early on but if it turns out later I can’t handle it then I lose  $ xxx  (depending on when I quit). i don't normally get freckles in the summer but I was out in the sun a good amount this time. the only new one I've noticed tho is on my tit . went for a swim and feeling temporarily better physically (?!) and mentally.. I WANNA. GO TO SPX NEXT YEAR....but it's so far that I can really only justify it if I table which means...MAKE...... BOOK. * Q* what a collection!! I hope you had a great time!!
I have Dream Sequence too!! it feels both amazing and awful when your hair is stripped down LOL
(I got clarifying shampoo for post-pond swimmies...also hard well water that probably contributed to my orange-ness). I'm salty bc there is no info on the riso machine ANYWHERE - website, lab, flyer is gone, etc. so I emailed + they forwarded it to the right person + they didn't reply >:( I saw them at school and I was like !??!?! ITS YOU. TELL ME YOUR SECRETS but I didn't approach orz. OH!!! I'm so jealous~~ I have absolutely no idea what the application process is like so I'll wish us both luck!! <3. :O oh! since it just happened info may not be up for a while but..if you find anything out . there's a comment on shorter's wiki page written in all caps asking how old he is and I feel like I ghost wrote this. "pretty. fucking. cute." - me, aloud, drawing eiji. Jennie’s “I forgot to ask my friends in time but if any *~mutuals~* can send me files now for charms or heart/star/cat buttons I’m placing my order after dinner” spectacular (dm me  ). This is so fluffy   (in more ways than one). My mom has a 50% success rate of not getting my colds..it seems this time she was not lucky. My poor immune system teams up w my anxiety and insomnia for maximum cold-catching . (Catches it in my mouth) 
Thank. My mom took my succulents out of the window to water them and never put them back and now half of them are dead . WHAT THE FUCK THIS IS SO CUTE. The top one is me and Cady whenever she sees a squirrel or even just *thinks* she sees a squirrel. W h a t. Can’t wait to see all the anime onlies laughing their asses off about mirio next week ... at first I was also like “this guy is.....” but you’re gonna fall for him I swear —- . Ohmygod?!? in talks w @pukaparade  abt LRT decided that Shorter would be a really good dad...I also feel like his kid would be one of those cute 5 year olds you see w a mohawk and you’re like “his parents are the best”. Anyway gonna go CRY NOW DJFNDNDNC

Video in replies! pic.twitter.com/7ws8WyrYtd. Maximum sparkle pic.twitter.com/Ndz3Wx5iT8. The amount of care Anna puts into each order - sending wips, adding glitter and 3d elements, including character drawings, — even down to the cute and careful packaging..It is ridiculous in the best way pic.twitter.com/Sfnm9LExdQ. She’s free to chase them once she’s not attached to me   (They easily run up trees and escape her). I’ve been thinking about watching this!! I went out and was gonna take a quick dip but it was windy so my tummy wasn’t happy with the kayak rocking and now I don’t feel like going back out fjdjdn. 'it's a genre i like plus there's good representation also i wanna bang one of the characters' - kasia. The colors printed so off but it’s due tomorrow so guess this is how it is . Wanna go to bed but it’s fucking arts and crafts time pic.twitter.com/NZGz4l8Lig. I’m cryin I said print three of each so I could mess up bc I’m shit at measuring and cutting and she gave me one of each..the paper is so thick I didn’t notice..I thought it was..simple. Craft fairs that allow pyramid schemes . Djfndjdn still sick, Rain makes me w Anna stay in bed..... Oh flash flood warning. Hi I just need you to know I love this a lot. Me, trying to decide if I can use this information to skip my first class: .

Happy Tuesday, folks pic.twitter.com/IDJR62dhg9. NANA OUT HERE DRAWING ALL MY FAVES . I feel like shit about myself about it but I’m skipping my first class. Ugh. Don’t feel good. Yeah that’s why I feel more guilty - I have to finish the project for the other class too..if I hadn’t waited then I would’ve gotten more sleep/felt better and gone..but also I’ve been sick since last week..I need to be less hard on myself but fndnnfd. Ddjsdb good luck with your homework though!!  Lets give ourselves a break but try to be better after this . Hn he’s really lax about attendance too it’s just that when I was younger missing school was A Thing and I don’t wanna get in bad habits.. I am sick tho..have to remind myself to REST djfn thank u .

Based on the art of hooping  pic.twitter.com/35mTSFefP8. Mini video! pic.twitter.com/KSb1M3jdFs.  Thank you so much! I wish I could photograph it better! I was a bit hesitant when my prof said to make the patterns on the figures colorful but I think it came out pretty cool!!  thank you!! Aaaaaa thank you so much   I tend to keep things simple but I think overstimulated was the goal so I met it HAHA. mom: remind me to do the dishes
me: oh shit i haven't been doing the dishes, i can do the dishes
mom: honey i haven't been doing the dishes either
me: ...............yeah this is a problem.....
I can't wait til..the dishwasher is reconnected..blease......... hnn I swim a lot (more now that we live here) and 80% of my bathing suits are too small/got when I was like 15 and there was a cute one for like half the price of the original and I didn't buy it and now the seller upped it to almost the full original price and i'm   don't be me. fdsgdhyj i'm sorry for your loss
it's only been two months and i'm already dead inside. I LOOKED IT UP AND -- I got 2 bathing suits last year (the two that actually Fit Me) and the others I bought were from SIX YEARS aGO?! I wasn’t really planning on fasting but I do feel bad bc I ate a fuckton of Italian food without even thinking of it . nO. Aa got a couple more patrons for pin club!! I hope it can keep growing so we can keep it going u vu I also got a lil surprise for this month..just smth small but it’s cute heh. Can’t believe I gotta do a “body check in” for yoga when I’m in pain rn orz. sometimes i appropriately name my files to help my future self out but my future self just assumes my past self was my usual dumbass self so then I still take a long time to find it thfdgh. eep. I didn't know my birthday club thing asked you for your gender and age, I'm not a fan of that..I'm gonna see if I can change it in settings or figure out an alternative. .like that's the WIDGEt, not me asking for that info..I'm not gonna..decide your 'reward' based on your age/gender?! Also it really just killed me that the gender options are like the two fucking male/female restroom sign people that'..s..that's not....ugh. me, yesterday: for this project I'll do lilypads and birch trees because those are significant to me
me, today, under pressure: F...FRUIT..FRUIT IS EASY. mom: uhh so all this money you have in this account..what is that?

No, no, you hit the nail right on the head! :). jdndjdndnd im feeling so manic like I already did MORE THAN ENOUGH to prepare for class tomorrow and yet im ldjdnjdndidk I feel like I need to do 100000 things ??? I mean there’s other things but I accomplished my shit for today so I should calm down and go to sleep early but. LRT I JUST DID THE LONGEST GASP. Yall I’m really excited for the big 3 djdjdjdndns. maybe i'll use this  energy (?? / unhealthy anxious energy) to finish that 95% done drwaing from 2 week s ago. I'MLATE. I drew this for the 3rd anniversary of Miraculous Ladybug! 
Miraculous led me to a few precious friends and the creation of my first ever fan zines, one of which raised thousands of dollars for charity. This series will always have a special place in my heart  pic.twitter.com/B2WKgT0Ivh. THANK YOU MAI!! --- I LET IT SIT FOR SO LONG HAHA WHOOopps
I'm so glad you like it friend TT A TT . DFSGDHYh OH WOW !! That's a big compliment TT A TT I think I may make some stickers of it soon so if I do I'll send ya one!! The workers said 9:30. It is 8:00. Cady is barking. I need that sleep. They better fucking Not. What the fuuuuck these people are the fucking worst they either come 2 hours before they said or 2 hours after..they didn’t even come for like nearly 2 weeks I’m. I’m so tired I have like a12 hour day ahead of me ssoskdjdndndndjdnsdf. It’s just. Don’t even tell me a time if you don’t mean it just say “I’m gonna show up whenever I feel like it so prepare yourself” and I will. I didn’t wash my hair and my outfit today is practically pajamas welcome to week 3 this is it, this is when I Give Up. Alright I’m gonna say it - the Small Might pop funko looks fine. LMFAO this is 100% true. Me: I have these (more finished) and these (very unfinished)
Prof + TA: Definitely these (very unfinished)
Me: haha cool cool cool coolcooocolckcococcocllc. Finally talked to my ex after almost two weeks of most recent rehab. When he asks me if I’m sleeping around I get so angry. 1. He knows me well enough to know I’m not and though I know it’s just his rampant insecurity it still offends me 2. If I were it’s Not. His. Business.  sudden incredibly personal tweet bc I keep experiencing the same shit w him over and over and idk what to do anymore. Ps what I’m offended by is not like - I’m not shaming people who are more casual w sex you do you- I’m offended that he thinks I’m like “oh I’m free of him time to go have fun and party!” Like no I’m still here trying to focus on myself and worrying about u fucker. I’m gonna ask this every Thursday bc I hate that I can only watch banana fish after yoga but 

no spoilers how was today’s episode of Banana Fish on a stress/sadness scale of 1-10, 1being uwu 10 being blood bath. I love Reese’s sticks bc it’s like a KitKat but /peanut butter/. THANK YOU FOR ANSWERING AGAIN!! I’m already agitated now tbh I may as well watch hahah 
OH NO I HATE BREAKS.. Also for when I get around to it, in notebooks/journals you prefer.. Hnn it’s at least the second time he’s worded it that exact way but he’s asked it nicer more times   It’s like he’s joking but he’s Not Joking yknow. Hahah yes, that too! I’m impatient but I do value the hard work they do!!! dfgdhfdh ; n; 
thank you, I try....this was a very kind tweet, I really appreciate it. it's just like...anytime i talk to him after a week or two it's like we say hello and talk for like 1 min and then This. Every time. I don't want to be negative bc he's not super stable but I can't keep this up either ysdhgdfg it's hard.. my ML illustration has garnered significantly more attention on tumblr - which I constantly forget to post on anymore - than any other platform. because??? younger teens are there?? or? I ONLY NOTICED BC sometimes I like to read the tags people wrote bc sometimes they're kind or funny and i was like just like ' o h.'. Omg my mom hasn’t really been watching banana fish with me consistently but she did today and at the end of today’s episode— 
Mom: ....I don’t feel good about that
Me: Guess what? There’s no episode next week.
Mom: What the fuck?!? Ps I also DONT FEEL GOOD ABT THAT wtf nothing even happened and I wanna cry but also i almost cried like three times today so it’s mostly just me. Sjdjdndj I just adore your style . my prof insisted on me using these drawings instead but they just don't look good if they're not  t i n y  for some reason................but she'll prob be like wtf if i make tiny notebooks.s.he...she said any size----. me, on the first day of class: I hope to learn about design in this class
professor: i can't tell by looking at these that you're really a designer
me: (looks into camera). LMFAOO MY PROF WAS LIKE ' i hate to say add a frog but ...yknow' and my mom was like 'WHAT IF YOU ADDED A FROG' and i added a frog and i like it 10 times bette ri hat E THIS LMeafsdfdghf. can't believe i'm live tweeting this drawing ok time for bed. LMFAOO AUTOCORRECT CHANGED THE ENTIRE MEANING OF THE TWEET.. she said I CAN tell by this ..meaning she's like YOURE A DESIGNER meanwhile I've never taken any design classes so I just bullshit around for a ton of time before arriving to something nice. ok i really need to make the kiri zine donations and i'm losin it bc i found a way to donate to a specific program and now i can't find the page dgjdgdfgh. i'm crying my mom found the page that said donate by initiative and she tried to direct me there but the same url took me to a different page and now we can't find it agian i'm. I may have found it!! will make a test donation to see what it says. LRT SCREAMinG GET READY FOR TOMORROW. the main unicef donate button gave me this really illegitimate looking plain text email but the specified one gave a nice email. lmfao i called my bank like hey can u let my unicef USA donation go through and they're like it's not allowed bc its either out of the country or an online casino and i'm like uhhhhh no neither of those......................... My mom and brother were watching something too mature for me in the living room so they set me up with Spirited Away. I think I was upset by her parents turning into pigs.. I also remember my cousins playing some sick game where they like dissected the powerpuff girls or smth.. https:// twitter.com/sephiramy/stat us/1042464777446993925   …. I've been on twitter too much. I just accidentally knocked the big bag of cady's treats on the ground and i told her 'these aren't for right now, don't@me'. somehow this just reminded me of in idk maybe 2nd grade when this kid said something like 'you can't watch pg-13 movies yet or you'll get messed up' and i had seen some so i started crying LMFAOO. Ack! I didn't buy my tickets for the dub bc I thought it was in more theaters. turns out it's only in all those theaters on opening day - and I wanna watch the sub (which is day 2) before the dub.........but the only ones after that are pretty full up except the one during yoga.. Quick self portrait / what’s in my bag doodles pic.twitter.com/oQangSCHAg. I showed this to my mom and she said really tiredly, "Oh Arby's, you slay me.."  IDONT Evne KNOW WHAT SHE WAS GOING FOR HERE? https:// twitter.com/Arbys/status/1 040257662703869952   …. can't believe unicef won't take my $ p .. lease i'm. begging you. In looking for something totally different I found this quote:
"A fool may throw into a well a stone which a hundred wise men cannot pull out."
...and it was really good and I wanted to share it. I literally emailed them like hey i gave u $2500 and i'm trying to give u more but no matter what computer, bank account, or credit card i use you won't take it send help. this is kind of random but I just really love how you drew his mouth bc i can practically feel it wobbling really cutely w excitement. that sounds like. a lot. LMFAO I was about to tag you. I was talking when I saw this and I just stopped mid-sentence. I..I'M STILL NOT SURE HOW TO READ THIS -- are.. are you good? are they good? is everyone...good? AAA I'm glad!! TT u TT <3 <3 <3. LMFAOO There's way worse PR crises than this..lean into the Meme. still unfinished but trying to make as much progress as possible so that I'm not worried about having to change a lot when I'm trying to enjoy the movie next week so art friendos --- feedback? thoughts on how to better tie these two together? (they're supposed to be a set..) pic.twitter.com/OriQkUt5y5. THIS LOOKS SO GOOD TT A TT *pokes fork at screen*. I thought I could tie them together by that Nature and some of the blues/greens are the same but I don't know if it's enough..my prof was like 'i dont think of birch trees and lilypads as being in the same place' and i'm like well then u haven't been to my house LMFAOO. I'm not sold on the bands, my prof said it would look classy but i'm ehh on it. Switched to horizontal orientation but I don't mind the square either. Hnn yeah my prof liked the color palette tho so I hesitate to adjust it too much.. she did mention adding verticals to it so maybe taller flowers or grasses or something which is I think what you’re getting at with breaking up the space and copying the vertical breaks of thetrees. Ohh I’ll try adding some yellow light!! (—and thank you Belén ). Adding yellow light seems to be the consensus so I’ll give it a go! Yeah, I was trying to adjust it from the original version to be more similar but you’re right I’ll try shifting that to blue more and add some yellow in. I haven’t packed for tomorrow but I’m so sleep deprived from the workers the past two mornings..... my dog is fast asleep (she didn’t even wake up for steak?! Normally she jumps up as soon as it’s out of the fridge) and now my mom is too and I’m 
Should I really 
Crawl into bed before 10 rn. Did I just get massively spoiled for Miraculous or was that an edit. @ mairinette  ...h...help?! I'll be upset if I was really just spoiled but I can't manage to find a new episode? was there one? KIDDING Its from a trailer so maybe it's just not as it seems but overall that's one heck of a trailer. Yeah I was like “I can’t believe this person posted spoilers like that” BUT ITS THE TRAILER .. tbh I think the first thing is probably a dream and not real u nu but still you’re right they’re like spoilers sans context. Grrr there must be a mosquito I keep waking with new bites. Me, one week ago: this is a perfect excuse to draw that big 3 illustration I’ve had sketched out for a year!
Me, today, having completely forgotten for the whole week that I wanted to do that: fuck. HIS NOOOOSSSSEEEE ohmygod. AU where I get more than 5 hours of sleep

I had 4-5 hours the last two nights so I got in bed at 11 last night but my body hates me and won’t stay asleep. WAIT I THOUGHT WE GET ONE MORE? Hey hey@someone more informed than me - is today the bnha finale or next week? Ok. Gotta pack for this con, yeah it’s 7 am day of u heard right. Thank you!! Uh right everything’s packed bc of granite state..I should have..slept. Yep! Pretty sure :). I’m at Ladies Con at the Armory in Somerville, MA today!! Come through   I am *upstairs* - there’s an elevator and stairs ~before~ you enter the main room, and there’s stairs at the back of the main room~ pic.twitter.com/5wLicmTKoF. I forgot I was making my kiri tip jar FOR TODAY whoooops.... I will still make him for the future   I’m just disappointed in myself. Until 5 . Yeah! It’s the third year! It’s run by a local comic book shop.  ! Maybe I’ll see you! (I know it feels awkward I don’t remember faces well so please introduce yourself orz). LRT GRKJDJDBSJSNNSBDBD. I had a nice day at Ladies Con!! Now I'm going to EAT A BUNCH OF ITALIAN FOOD, WATCH BOKU NO HERO, AND TAKE A HOT SHOWER. and then, depending on the time and my energy level, draw or sleep. NEVEERrrrr. lrt the last one   character. development. I'm so glad you were able to come by!! This board is so pretty..oh my you sure do have a collection of mine!! So flattering TT A TT <3 <3 <3. i want the animate keychain of kiri with the goggles and tube......h..elp..
OH I DIDNT COUNT MY MONEY FROM TODAY MAYBE I CAN JUSTIFY THIS PURCHASE. oh. It's a small quiet  lil show but I did better than I thought so.........../boy LOL. somehow i ended up watching this show where this incredibly unqualified couple tries to rennovate a house and they're painting the fireplace and they didn't even tape the area off and it's dripping.. .p ..please ..just..google something i........ I really like Doug
 the animation is so wonky the colors of things just flicker to different colors at random. The one day I have concert tix and I’ve been in bed all day, sleeping almost all day. I feel awful even w medicines wtf ugh. i feel awful but i've been looking forward to this concert for months so i guess i'm gonna go stand outside at the freakin seaport. I have no good explanation for why I feel so persistently bad today..maybe I just overdid it lately... Wow! What a haul! Thank you so much for coming by . lmfaoo I'm so tired that I just keep saying "I'm tired' ..maybe four times now and my mom just goes YES, JENNIE, YOU'VE SAID IT A FEW TIMES NOW  dgh. Cade and I are also cuddling!! pic.twitter.com/ig9zfJRQw0. THIS IS AMAZING!! I think I follow them on insta or smth cause i'm always seeing their classes and crying bc it's too far haha. Same here!! The workers have the doors open . I’m bad abt posting doodles here.. My favorites from Saturday’s insta doodle request session ! pic.twitter.com/IVoxNObSoa. lrt thanks i hate it . lmfaoo I'm sorry miraculous using cycle instead of birthday just makes me think of periods I'm sorry I'm 5 years old djsfgshtshf. "THERES NO WAY THIS COULD GO WRONG" - marinette, all the time
(Sorry i'm live tweeting this apparently). hey y'all I got extra tix to the subbed premiere of Two Heroes Wednesday@Boston Regal Fenway, but looks like my friends won't be able to come, so I wanted to offer them to y'all before releasing them back into the wild tomorrow. They were 14.40 + 1.50 processing fee each DM me! I really wanted to make stickers to hand out at the movie..and cosplay too..but I seriously lost all of yesterday and most of today to not feeling good and catching up on sleep?? my face still hurts a lot but I have to finish homework ugh. oh thank god i had a breakthrough on this piece my head hurts so fuckin bad. No can do~ due tomorrow! haha I’ve been chipping away at it so I wouldn’t have to do it last minute but I’m a slow worker . lrt this omake was FUCKInG.

.  Thank you for the support TT A TT I just wanted to make a lot of progress so I can watch Two Heroes in peace tomorrow!! hahaha. Fenway? :O. I would just like to say that there’s like 5 people with penises in my whole school yet any time I go into a bathroom the seat is up and it smells like urine. Ohh well it’s not AMC that’s probably why! That’s a bummer tho! :( we’ll miss each other! I thought putting quotes on the journals would dress up the back or inside cover a bit and i found one I like for the trees but no such luck for the lilypads :(. THANK YOU dgtrdd TT A TT <3. Thank you!! I worked hard!! <3 <3. Not too different from last night but I'm officially calling it quits on these suckers! Now for the..b..acks (LMFAO Nah, just keeping it simple)

I plan to make these into actual journals - maybe even screen print them - sometime soon! 

Thank you for your feedback, everyone! pic.twitter.com/jusvwvej11. Can y’all believe I didn’t go to the premiere tonight bc I’m a snob who wants to see the subbed before the dubbed? . This is actually..a very good point . I think I only feel that way cause I wanna not ONLY see the sub but I wanna see it FIRST so I ...can pick the dub apart even more.. LMFAOOO. LMFAOO I THINK THAts the case omg. Since my headache, nausea, and sinus pain have finally all completely ceased for the first time since Sunday morning —- I’m gonna go see about some sticker paper. hi i'm too scared to go onto the wiki (spoilers) can someone..tell me ash and eiji's heights it's for science. hmmhmhm i guess its more their height difference so actually i could probably just look at an episode ahah 
THANK YOU THO <3. blessed
THANK U MISTY. My..throat hurts. made buttons of izuku in his ugly ass suit for tonight. See u fuckers in Fenway
Idk if ill be cosplaying Nejire or not but I’ll be wearing an obnoxiously large Kirishima ita backpack 
HMU for free buttons LMFAO #myheroacademiatwoheroes pic.twitter.com/pN5uMeKk8M. Djsjdjdjs next time we’re at the same event I’ll throw one at you?!  I love a Boy #MyHeroAcademiaTwoHeroes pic.twitter.com/tguWLsNTLY. I think everyone went out bc it’s nice out bc there’s “heavier than usual” traffic . As we’ve travelled 12 minutes have been added to our estimate arrivaldjjdndjd. YEHA TURNS OUT. So close yet so far I’m cryin. I’m gonna be late and I have to pee I was supposed to be 15 mins early why this. Omg your socks are amazing!! I hope you enjoyed it! THE MOVIE WAS GOOD I MISSED A FEW MINUTES BC THE EMPLOYEE INSISTED THE MOVIE DIDNT START FOR 20 minutes and I asked multiple times if she was sure and yet I walked in and it was playing . BUT ANYWAY THE MOVIE WAS SO GOOD. LMFAO I WAS SO ENGROSSED IN YHE Film I never adjusted my chair at all. LMFAO I hope they left enough room behind you   imagine if they installed them flush against the wall. Yes!! It really was!!   I kept thinking it was about to end but it kept going and I was so happy!! During the first rounds I was like haha hell but fine but in the end it got so intense!! I adore this..I love these outfits too and I love the whole look of this piece - like how you chose to leave it a little rough!!    it really suits it! Yes!! It was so great to see it in the same theater with friends and other fans! It really makes the experience special...I may go again tomorrow HAHA (I wanna see the dub too..)
Yes, it seems to be well received!! I WAS BLESSED BY THESE TODAY. They’re even cuter in person   I think mirio is my favorite of the set but tamaki’s pointy ears..and Nejire’s hair flipsAND THE SOFT BLUSH

THANK U @circusbonez    PLEASE TELL ME HOW TO REPAY YOU..also it was good to see you, even briefly! pic.twitter.com/t2tfDaXVdr. Aaa they’re so cute!! Fun energy!! I can’t believe you posted this major spoiler. THIS IS PRETTY TRUE....... Good. Mom: I didn’t know my rabbi was a lesbian
Me: ..That sounds like a novel. LRT MAI IS SUPER SWEET AND DRAWS IN SUCH A CUTE STYLE PLS SUPPORT HER. Thank you!! <3. aaaa nooo I'm hoping it's just like??? leftover from the last cold or bc of my sinuses? I feel ok now jus..t..m...mucus-y (blegh!)
I HOPE YOU DONT GET SICk../TUCKS U INTO BED. THIS IS SO S T U N N I N G?! @ lanimani  @circusbonez  this felt relevant. YEAH!! I wish we'd gotten to see more of them but I'm glad they didn't like FORCE IT either yknow? subbed!!! I wanna see the dub tomorrow...m..m.aybe..it's kind of..during..class.. LRT FUCK PLEAS WATCH THIS. I bought tickets to the dub tomorrow during yoga class...........WE’LL SEE HOW I FEEL I GUESS (they’re cancellable). Can you believe I took a walk in the woods with my dog, swam in the pond, AND saw the movie I’ve been looking forward to for months today? Pretty damn good.. cady is cuddling but I have to go to bed :(. IDK WHAT IM LOOKING AT BUT I LOVE. my melody kirishima...this is a good look. LRT yknow how kirishima canonically dressed up as little red riding hood? ......hear me out...my melody (red version). LRT I want a phone case for the first time in like 8 years. It doesn’t fit my old ass phone, rest in pieces. How does laying down laminate require hammering and drilling I’m so tired. Having an uncharacteristicly yolo kinda day where I’m skipping my first class to get s l e e p and my third class to see Boku no hero dub zzzzzz I’m too tired and pleasantly buzzed from yesterday being nice to be anxious about it rn..I’ll be anxious abt it later LMFAO. I have to be good for a while after this but considering I already got through my semi-annual start of semester cold and only missed one meeting of one class for it that should be doable. Following my TA on insta is a weird experience bc my prof is like, “I hope she comes today,” yet I see on her story that she’s eating chicken nuggets on a bus to NYC. IM SEEING THE MOVIE DUBBED AND IDK MY STOMACHS TURNINF IM NERVOUS? Aaa btw y’all stay after the caps from the movie there’s cute bbq photos and a bit more footage !!   I missed it the first time bc we were chatting haha. Skipped yoga to see the movie again. No regerts   
I got to see College!Might and Dave which I missed yesterday bc of ball game traffic.
Accompanied by big nitotan Deku and my Mirio from @circusbonez pic.twitter.com/4pmZewiZUJ. Now THIS I can get behind. I love Horikoshi but I still wish he could’ve heard the collective groan of the audience tonight when Mineta appeared. Heyya I'm doing a giveaway on Insta! 
It ends Saturday night! Info here for those interested!
 https://www. instagram.com/p/Bn7NtWSgkef/ ?taken-by=cambrasine   … pic.twitter.com/QfRgdDq8PV. tfw u see someone selling smth u included for free but would normally charge $1for.. for $5  . people reselling artist's stuff for more than the artists charge is getting more commonplace is all;; This case was just like a declutter which is fine I just thought it was priced too high for what it was but some people buy w the intent to resell for more. I FEEL LIKE THAT PUNISHMENT DOESN'T QUITE FIT THE CRIME. hnn idk I've only heard of it though I have seen people just reselling small amounts of things for more.. OR like I saw a LOT of people reselling zine merch for way more than the difference in cost for bundles. LMFAOO I LOVE THIS Aizawa's looking over like 'should i do smth'. WAIT REALLY I HATE THAt...now i kinda wanna look for mine > N<. ebay for anime merch is a fucking joke tho it's SO OVERPRICED Like damn I can pay for shipping from japan and it'll still be cheaper u fuckers. tag yourself i'm aizawa. LIKE I GOT MY KIRIBAKU SCHOOL UNIFORM NITOTANS FOR LIKE WHAT $40? And someone on ebay has them for $140  and it says 7 sold you've gotta be j o k i n g ?! omg I was so sad I saw this really cute kiri button and I asked who the artist was and the person was like I GOT IT HERE ON EBAY And I was just like 'NOOOOO'. i'm glad my friends have taken my under their wings to teach me to get that good good merch in the right places. tryna make a big 3 ita bag is a huge pain in the ass cause y'all are always forgetting about my girl!!!
like I LOVE MY BOYS but damn you're already 2/3 of the way there just draw her too pls you're making my life hard rDSFOGHGJGFJ. I love the way you portrayed this?! WHEEZE I didn't rush to buy this bc I thought it was preorders but guess not cause it's sold out /lays down. RIGHT LIKE I GET IT mirio / tamaki's past is different and stuff but :( :( :( drawherufools. lrt hi do you have a minute to talk about nejire hadou. OHH IM GLAD YOU PHOTOGRAPHED THESE I was sad i missed the chance cause I wanted to look at them more haha. Nationwide groan LMFAO. Yes!! My fave was the one with Bakugou pouting in the corner and Kirishima approaching w like 4 skewers of meat haha. A universal experience . PLEASE . Do y’all remember when the kiribaku tag on ao3 was just a bunch of tododeku fics where kiribaku appeared for two seconds / was “implied”. The stuffed animal I sleep cuddled with and the roll of toilet paper I keep next to my pillow in case of sinus issues are similar in size. I feel like you know where I’m going w this. (In which Jennie often wakes up w a roll of tp cradled to her chest while her most precious possession falls to the wayside). I can’t believe I’ve been head over heels for so long . It was so real I even remember seeing a tweet about it . Omg you’re right I remember sorting this way. I just can’t even fathom how anyone could hear that woman’s emotional testimony then listen to that guy yell angrily about about YEAH SO WHAT WE ALL DRANK BEER+ a bunch of other random shit and be like “hm it could go either way” and “who knows let’s just approve this guy”. I just like. They asked did u drink beer and the answer could’ve been yes but he just went on and fucking on it was so ridiculously defensive. Omg we’re...the same  
Blurry but here’s a look at what I’m dealing w pic.twitter.com/qlBftyGU70. LMFAOO yours looks more similar to it too . I just don’t get how republicans could go ahead w this right before the midterms where they already risk to lose certain states..like uh are you hoping people will just forget this Giant fucking thing in two months???? Jdjdndnddnpolitics, man. Changed my twitter name. /lays down
I feel like I just place my orders at the worst times every time?! Looks like I’ll be sending some emails tonight . He may see this bc he’s out but. He’s not in inpatient anymore bc he didn’t wanna be there but last time the meds were locked up and he still found a way. How many more close calls do we have to suffer through? Until smth happens that he can’t come back from? I’m so tired.. Our next assignment is holiday cards and I feel moderately obligated to do Chanukah..if my grandma were here she’d be so excited for it.. We’ll see where thumbnails take me tho but we also have to make an “accessory” so I thought diy paper dreidel . UPDATE SHE’S IN LINE FOR THE BTS CONCERT  https:// twitter.com/cambrasine/sta tus/1045404113557753856   …. Does anyone have one of those mini printers that uses heat and special paper instead of ink? If so, thoughts? No like uh the one you print photos on and they can be stickers too. I mean the mini pictures/polaroids one!! I think so! There’s a few diff ones. I’m just gonna go ahead and say it. I’m hot for College!David Shield. Too bad he’s got a boyfriend.
(adult David isn’t bad [looking] either but ..college David was *cool*). HOW IS NO ONE BEHIND ME ON THIS. Adult Dave...his heart was in the right place
I like his stupid hair when he was younger. (the boyfriend is All Might). (JUST IN CASE). kin*kuniya: are you ready for the bnha pop up shop?
me: more like are YOU ready....... WAIITT I DIDNT SEE THAT? was it in one of the background photos? GUH nope. I didn't know it was delayed and I couldn't make it last weekend bc of a con.............i'm glad they're limiting per person this time but tbh the yuri on ice one was a mess I couldn't really risk going for nothing ; n;. I BELIEVE IN YOU THO!!! GO GET THAT GOOD GOOD MERCH. wow yeah I didn't even hear about the second one..........they've been hyping this one tho > n<. MWUAHAH. Full design is now up for Patrons!

#bnhainktober2018 pic.twitter.com/x9eWhd44Jp. also my apologies to Everyone for my icon. this is a science fact. the following three facts are true about my good friend
1. He has lived in LA on and off many times in his life, including for the past year
2. He has been an anime fan for many years
3. He didn't know what Anime Expo was. his exact response when I excitedly told him I got in was
"Holy shit

What's that exactly". Thank you u vu <3. It's on a black BG but it's just like. in really stark contrast to...relaxing ?!? haha. dsGDHJHO THIS WAS REALLY SWEET AND POSITIVE THANK YOU sdgdfh
<3 <3 <3 My bro may come along and my friend offered to help me too..I'm really grateful that everyone is so supportive TT A TT 
Aaa I'll see you there!!!! it's in his DNA. In hindsight I’m kicking myself for not putting Mirio in here what kind of fool am I. AAA THANK U CITRA!   it’s thanks to your prompt list that this drawing exists!! Omg you’re so right..good boys know that sharing is caring . I feel Personally Attacked. I did a bad job in color theory today and it made me feel bad . I think in general today I’m just feeling..really subdued :( I’ll try yoga when I (eventually) get home.. SFDIDG MY TA JUST LIED HER AsS OFF TO MY PROF she's like 'haha..yeah..i'm feeling better' 'it must've been the cold from hell!' 'ha...yeah...'

MMM I WENT. The kid I kicked outta my seat was kinda cute but he left his trash - mind you there’s a trash can IN the theater - and not even on his SEAT - but on the FLOOR!! Where someone would step on it! Dummy. . Anyway I’ve been the movies more this past week than the last like 3 months lmfao. I’ll help u out @circusbonez. LRT IS SO CUTE!!

“Now that I’ve got your attention - New tweet!”. LRT IM HAPPY FOR MHA BUT SO SALTY BC I WENT WHEN I WAS TIRED LAST NIGHT W/O MY FRIEND BC I WAS CONVINCED THEY WOULDNT EXTEND IT IF THEY HADNT ALRESDY DJDNFBDMFNDNNDNHRRRR. Wow!!   Thank you so much for the well wishes!! lrt I actually haven't had too many rude experiences in AA but I know friends who desperately need this jar. Some nice words from the end of the guided meditation for class:
“You’re at one point on your journey towards emotional balance. Value that point without looking forward or backward in any way. Take some time to appreciate the work that you’ve done.”. I was looking for smth mindless to do and I kept seeing this around.......feels pretty accurate pic.twitter.com/Gbnf0o7BnE. (Eyes emoji). science: u should work for an hour then take a ten minute break
me: works for an hour then takes an hour break. @ squareclewd. LMFaofshd i think we've all been there.. guhh every other week the writing was self reflection but this week it's like READ A BUNCH THEN ANSWER SCIENTIFIC QUESTIONS which would be ok if i didn't have a headache
also i'm not naturally good at science, even tho I did well it always required more work > n<. prof: answer this question and use the following scientific terms
me: (writes a bunch of rambling shit and kind of includes what I understand of the science here or there)
me: this...is this it..is this what u wanted. u know u have a migraine when u spell repetition wrong three times in a row,. i'm sorry we're like this. Day 3 #bnhainktober2018  I have homework and a headache, but I also had this shitty ballpoint pen and an envelope so ..tada! 
I didn’t look at a ref.....Toga is my favorite villain by far.....after her maybe ..Kurogiri? pic.twitter.com/nyNPUXgF3g. last tweet but not super relevant so posting separately: I don't really like Dabi much? Like I like the idea of him as a Todoroki and his siblings but standalone..idk he looks cool but he just like straight up murders a bunch of people w fire always and i'm not really into it LOL. Like those drawings of baby Todoroki siblings get me right in the feels but otherwise I’m ..so indifferent to him..I feel like he’s kinda popular too.... LMFAO This, pretty much. I just have no interest in him unless it’s in relation to baby Shouto.. Ahaha we all have our problematic faves. How can you decide whether something’s happened without even talking to the people who are saying they experienced it. What a fucking Sham. I have No words. This shit simultaneously makes me filled with rage and not want to get out of bed, and I haven’t even experienced anything like that.. Survivors.. always, but this week especially ..you’re so, so fucking strong. lmfaoo this assignment a couple weeks ago was like talk about your habits and i just wrote a bunch of negative shit and my prof was like u know u can also say smth nice abt yourself seDFOHJFTYHG 
REMEMBER KIDs...........BE KIND TO YOURSELf.. lrt me when hiking with my brother
he's literally taking a class this semester where he climbs trees i'm--. THIS IS SO SOFT AAa. The gradient is so well done, too, like you fit in enough colors for it to add interest but not so many that it's overwhelming or distracting ...and the girls are just...so cute TT A TT. lrt my dream and nightmare both came true (looks at eiji's sweater)
also this is maybe my third time tweeting this but WHEN WILL WE GET BOKU NO HERO BEARS ...just imagine a cute bear in a UA uniform...or in like..kiri's bdsm mask i'm cryin. also lrt i know it's ash's outfit but it feels kind of uninspired ?? like just looks like a really casual bear?! haha. every banana fish fan merch: allusion to or outright includes banana and/or fish
official merch: plain af. Hdjdjd Omg I think you’re right tho..like there’s something interesting to be done w him but in canon so far he’s not super inspiring? Just not my cup of tea but I see why people could be interested. Screams for 9 months they emailed me a coupon every other week, until I was ready to use it and then sent nothing for over three MONTHS and now I don’t check that email for One Day and they sent me one but it’s already expired I’m so—   curse u w*x... OH CRAP YOURE RIGHT... None of the responses to this are healthy work/rest patterns dudnjdsj. Honestly tho these are my only two modes like 1:1 or 10 hours straight and forgetting til I’m done that I had to pee 2 hours in . Lmfao the guy on the radio “these kids are yknow texting online til 2 AM!” . Like 20% of my yoga class is my prof telling us about her past lives along w disclaimers of “you don’t have to believe this it’s just my experience”. The time has come for me to once again ask - without spoiling - how stressful was this week’s #bananafish  ? Scale of 1-10, 1 being slumber party 10 being torture fest. Spicy. (But also the color scheme and lighting are really pretty)...a good concept too haha. I still don’t know how she’s alive I really thought she would’ve killed her?! She seems physically and emotionally fine?! I have so many questions ?! OOF ..........yeah that's still pretty rough. I figured it was too peaceful the last couple weeks haha Thank you for the warning <3. Damn!! I have been putting off reading the manga bc I..IM NOT EMOTIOnaLLY STABLE ENOUGH FOR IT RN TBH haha
Thank you for the heads up!! <3 also (eyes your icon) uh oh. chill jam, cool illustration
 https://www. youtube.com/watch?v=rSL3LX 8YYOw   …. another chill jam, this one w stop motion animation https://www. youtube.com/watch?v=39IU7A DaXmQ   …. yessss I finally got the riso hours and prices today!! you can tell i'm a n00b bc she said we have multiple colors + black and gray riso ink and i'm just like??? black and GRAY??? isn't??? gray just???black at a lower opacity? tireb. Guys I have a huge problem
I’m tired but I want a muffin but it has to cool off which means I have to wait up and also I can’t lay down immediately after consuming it
There’s never been a bigger problem than this one , try to name one I’ll wait. Sometimes I seriously question if people are watching the same show as us
like are they watching some alternate dimension version or what. like..even if you don't ship smth you can acknowledge that 'oh yeah they hang out a lot in canon that could be a thing' like..how hard is that..........WHY ARE THESE PEOPLE ATTRACTED TO YOUR TABLE. cady is taking a nap and looks sooo peaceful!! I'm not really tired but I'm still jealous cause it looks like it feels nice haha. you ever see someone say smth kind of mean and u wanna tell them hey that was mean but then u remember its the internet and you're not tryna get sucked into the black hole of arguing w a stranger on social media. ALRIGHT I SAW MORE OF THE SAME SO IM GONNA STOP VAGUING if the anime fest part of nycc is a wreck - + i wouldn't doubt that it is, considering they were just like fuck anime = money?money! then put in 0 effort - fine! BUT----. Stop calling the artists there nycc's AA rejects. It's really fucking rude. Getting into cons is HARD + doesn't mean u r unskilled. I know several amazing artists participating +if the con is as bad as u say then they're having a shitty time w/o u insulting them on top so shut it. thanks for coming to my ted talk. LMFAOO I DONT EVEN KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS..but i'm sorry that happened to you. yeah i'm not gonna directly fight them but i saw a couple people saying the same thing and it made me mad on behalf of my friends!! > n<. YEAH I THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY RUDE. oh no this reminded me of in the manga when kirishima's hair stabs -- I think it was Sero - in the eye LMFAO. I think they were just upset abt the event but like hey please direct your outrage to the correct places. .................this is a mood
I sent /some/, I really did.. also fun fact: if you say or do smth wrong the answer is not deleting evidence, it's apologizing. SORRY FOR ALL THE TED TALKS IM OUT---. here's a vague tweet for you bb <3 https:// twitter.com/cambrasine/sta tus/1048328941323390976   …. LMFAOOO remind me not to get on your bad side~~ ;P. LMFAoOO i wish this wasn't Me but it is. i lasted 2.5 days of inktober that's pretty on-brand. you ever stop and think about how kirishima eijirou's birthday is coming up. I'd do something but...what? https:// twitter.com/cambrasine/sta tus/1048338642735964165   …. “Excuse me, may I have a new napkin - I drew my OTP all over this one..” #bnhainktober2018. I read a good fic today it made me wanna draw it. Every time I see smth about this person I get frustrated so I finally did the thing where it mutes anything containing x and I was like good jenn good move and then went back to happily scrolling and THERE WAS A POST W X IN IT help how does this work. me@me : stop watching banana fish all u do is suffer. can u believe eiji's gonna be on Locked Up Abroad. laugh thru the pain everbody. I showed my mom my holiday card illustrations because I wanted her (positive) feedback since I hadn't really shown her through the process and she just started making jokes about them til she saw my face and had the realization that I made them DFGfHg. not like 'lol this drawing is so bad' kinda way just like 'why is she showing me these?? something is funny about them? I'll try to list things it could be so she thinks I got it'. should i get off my ass and take a shower because
> i'm cold
> i really need a shower. ...lani i....... THIS TAMAKI----------. thank you for the support friends. Lmfao min I like this version. I need to finish my Halloween designs Now or not for a year so please give me strength to do that this weekend 
All I wanna do is draw cute fan art for a fic I read
Also there’s the whole Homework thing
Also—-. Square readers just /break/, always. 
Square’s annual income makeup: 
5% Fees from swipe transactions
2% Fees from keyed in transactions 
93% You and I buying countless readers when they inevitably crap out. @ tdrkiz  sorry to be a pain but!! A friend of mine posted a pic of your Big 3 charm and I HAVE A MIGHTY NEED!! I’m going to make an ita bag for them and it’s so adorable   I was wondering if you plan to sell them again/online in the future? Thank you! . Seriously! I got a free plain square one a million years ago and bought another for when I kept misplacing it, then bought a fancy chip reading one. Guess which two still work and which one broke almost immediately . I KNEW IT WAS PRO ROW AND I STILL HAD AN ANEURYSM. Ugh I have this show next weekend and I’m just so tired. I don’t have time or energy to make things I wanted to make for it. I have a bat mitzvah I really don’t wanna fucking go to but “have to” bc family meaning I need someone to watch the table part of that day I’m so tired. But it’s cool and different and I paid for it and attendance looks solid...but...fuck. Yes!! 
Wheeze id lend u my strength but I have none   I hope you can power thru and have fun and make money then. R E S T..
Yeah, this show is a different type - not an anime con - so I feel like without having made the things I wanted to that I’ll be really out of placedjdnjd. oh fuDGE joey and my moms birthdays are REALLY SOON and I have No Ideas   I either know exactly what to get someone or not at all and there is No in between . Sorry for your loss. Sorry to be a pain in the butt but — do you know the title of this ep? I love this thread. casually sketches a few dozen panels for yet another comic i'll never actually draw. this is the cute fic i wanna draw btw  https:// archiveofourown.org/works/16172021   
(kiribaku of course). lrt Follow up! You can register to vote online BUT -- or at least in MA -- you have to have a driver's license to do so! So if you never learned to drive like me (a fool) and need to register for the first time or update info, then make sure you make time to go in person!! like who DOESNT want to draw Bakugou getting smacked in the face w a leaf?----. THANK YOU!! omg a two part-er !! that was a lot! THANK YOU <3 <3 <3. * Q* I WOULD *LOVE* TO TRADE!! Your stuff is so precious too! Definitely, just let me know any time!! . I drew for today and yesterday inktober but.. ; n;. I feel like more muffins are good then cupcakes bc the frosting has to be perfect but if you get a good one —— damn . Weather: it’s gonna rain today!! All day and night! Sleep in! Forget the two outdoor things you really want to do!!
Me: ok! 
Weather: haha bitch I lied. Uhh I think the only two options here are memorial or art installation. Uh I went swimming (fully clothed) in the pond a week ago and now my new neighbor is swimming today and I feel weirdly competitive . My mom locked the keys in the car . “I got locked out of my car” 
I think what you mean is u locked Yourself out of your car. I do this sometimes too I’m just salty cause I’m stuck in a parking lot w my doggo. You could try pressing on the pressure point for nausea that’s on the inside of your wrist, or get one of those seasick prevention wristbands that does that! You could also ask your dr for ondansetron to prevent nause/vomiting. it’s a med they give people after anesthesia! (I sometimes get nausea w my migraines so I take it probably about once a month on really bad days). I hope it helps!! Also uh idk if you were joking or not but if not I really don’t need the money   I just want you to feel better! I know how disruptive to productivity it can be. Sorry I’ve just been really sad and angry here the past few days I’m gonna stop doing that for a bit..there’s already more than enough negativity this week. So is someone gonna make a banana fish AMV to my blood by twenty one pilots or??? I think it’d be the sort of thing you’d cringe at in ten years but I really wanna see it right now hahaha.  Thank you Mai! I just need to snap out of it > n<. LRT I like how horikoshi draws kinda wide so it’s a bummer when the anime thins waists and increases boob definition . I agree! Before I looked at the caption/dates I was like oh this must be a telephone thing like them and a friend drew the same--- OH. 
Amazing improvement and style development in such a relatively short time! lrt i need one of these omg. it's still something! Better to give yourself a break than to overwork yourself! ; u;. THIS LOOKS..REALLY COOL. me, abt to communicate abt manufacturing delays and seeing 'marked as gift' on an order: pic.twitter.com/ADN4REfTz7. guys what the fuck color should i dye my hair. BEEN THERE DONE tHAT..it was..supposed to be pastel orz. first I wanted PURPLE PURPLE and due to various disasters I never got a full head of medium->light purple. now I'm like should I try that again or....orchid? bubblegum? PERIWINKLE? (3rd image is douxf*iry rest are ?? i'm sorry)

THOUGHTs.. pic.twitter.com/qnEj5mY4wp. pLEASE. <3. I've wanted purple since I was a baby (middleschool) and it's been purple but never the color I want, and never my whole head, bc of various mishaps....now i'm debating whether the 5000th try is the charm or try smth else I just posted some pics!

Ohh what kind of blue'd ya have? yeah I think all these colors are shit to keep up but i heard pink sometimes fades to orange and I don't want that ; n; However my first purple faded to the most obnoxious magenta..my other purple faded to gray which was good.. ...I WOUld..LOVE TO SEE THAT
I like my hair dresser she does a beautiful balayage - but the colors she's mixed in the past when I asked for purple kinda scare me..but if I mess it up on my own I'm gonna have to go crying to her ..agaIN HAHA. yeah my hair is really brassy at the moment but my hairdresser said she can get me super super light and i had icy blonde before so I think it'll be possible! pic.twitter.com/zPxXbItAik. ahh like a light blue or a BLUE BLUE? 
I think maybe periwinkle wouldn't go Green but I do'nt know that.. I feel like pink is a weird color for fall/winter though, purple seems more fitting, but you're definitely right that it'd be easier to go that way. LMFAOO SHARK BLUE IS ONE HELL OF A NAME FOR THE C OLOR ThO. LATE AND MESSY but I wanted to do a lil something at least~
HAPPY (BELATED) BIRTHDAY  @perdizzion  !!! I hope it was a good one!
(also sorry)

hehe I like drawing this stoic boy all flush~~
  
I feel so validated, thank u. it says RTa instead of RTs it's almost 2 am pls forgive me. IVE BEEN WANTING TO GET THEM FORVER and this felt like a good excuse to buy them. ahah if you want I can combine them and refund you the shipping? But if you want them as they come then you can keep it this way~ Up to you! if you needed a song about your faves turning out to be REAL FUCKING BAD then here you go  https://www. youtube.com/watch?v=9iQGtQ 9_aOs   …. No worries!! It's really not much trouble!! <3 I'd rather save ya $$$. @ grimmfirefly  halp. I don’t wanna spend $23 on a plush that may or may not end up being Shorter Wong :(. Not sure what you’re style is like but @UchuuSummer  has some pretty rad ones. Me last night: wow I have so much to do tomorrow 
Me today: (lays in bed til 2). why are chibis with guns so funny
just like
the juxtaposition. it's not tomorrow yet but I already don't wanna go to school LMFAO
Usually if i go through the motions I make it there but gee whiz. I didn't miss a single class from anxiety the last 2 semesters and here I am 1 month in trying to ration my absences ..whoops. LRT THIS IS SO MANY KIRIS. OH. FOR THE POLAROID CHARMS..MINI DRY ERASE MARKER KEYCHAINS THAT CLIP ON?????? LIKE YOU CAN write on the charm underneath ash+eiji the place you're taking the photo (or whatever you want)? me@me: how much in the red can I make myself by adding a bunch of special things 
WHATEVER IM EXCITED ..LET ME HAVE THIS. What a coincidence because I wanna READ a comic about gay boxers /throws $ at y. Turns out this week’s yoga reading is about being compassionate to yourself and I’m feeling called out . I think series like these are classics that no one will fault you for falling back into. My first book for this class is Yoga for Emotional Balance by Bo Forbes (she’s a local, too!) and it’s been..really nice? Each chapter of pt 1 ends with breathing and yoga practices and some have recordings online too if you like to be guided. I just feel like if you have anxiety or depression (or both) then you  start reading this book and when she lays things out so simply you’re just like Wow that’s Me.
Anyway I’m only thru pt 1 but I’d recommend it..I think pt 2 tells you how to do certain poses+what they’re good 4. And it’s not like physically strenuous or anything - there’s a real focus on giving yourself supports if you and being compassionate if you’re too uncomfortable for a certain practice or pose at the moment. Can you believe my silhouette cameo WORKED? i'm feeling so blessed. anyone w a silhouette or other die cut machine knows what i'm talking about--. aaaa I received an email from a con but it was a WE got IT not a YOU got IN haha. lrt just when u thought u couldn't love ash any more--. lrt iwant to be him. One hell of a thread. https:// twitter.com/tragedythyme/s tatus/1049044475857788928   …. I didn't know I needed this but I DID! I ADORE these teens doing stupid teen things TT A TT <3 letthembehappy. Yeah...yikes. It's crazy...but also just like having someone put into words that moment we've experienced where you are doing mental math on 'how likely is this man to attack me' is..insane. OHH..... IT KINDA..MAKES HIM MORE INTERESTING LOOKiNG TO ME but I see why the OG is maybe more generally appealing. cady rests her head on my lap when, I rest my elbow on her head, we have a symbiotic relationship. I did it --- I made a HOW WELL DO YOU KNOW ME QUIZ: BNHA EDITION  https:// buddymeter.com/quiz.html?q=lj 1r6Wn   …  

There are some VERY easy ones and some you'll be like 'this chick never said anything about this ever' so....DO YOUR BEST! Hahaha it’s true tho!! But he’d be the most stoic one ahahha. Anxiety is still jogging to class even when u know the teacher and students are ALWAYS late . Omg..the flowers one is Very Nejire. Prof, showing another prof my illustration: she’s going to change this but otherwise it’s great!
Me, having already made the changes: haha..yeah. My prof is gonna show my holiday cards to a local gift shop but ya never know bc channukah gets no love--- but just in case (or for myself?) I wrote to catprint abt gold foil (eyes emoji). UHhh my cameo did not like the foil...c*tprint pls b kind to me with your pricing cause I can't deal w this for an actual printing HAHA. LRT The best girl q is really getting everyone LOL I .. I LOVE THEM BOTH A LOT I just... 
(MY QUIZ SPOILER)
.
.
.
.
.
.
I love Nejire + she is a queen, but we know a lot more about Ochako! I like: she's upbeat, determined, STRONK, + relatable occasional competitive+jealous sides. (QUIZ SPOILER CONTINUED)
.
.
Plus even though her reasons have changed, I think her original reason for becoming a hero was interesting+as someone who grew up pretty poor I can def appreciate it + how deku+iida reacted. Wanting to live comfortably + support your fam is admirable! I got a 4 or a 5 on yours so /pats u. anyway, they're all good girls, brent. I THINK ALMOST EVERYONE IF NOT EVERYONE GOT THAT WRONG and tbh I had her as my fave initially before I was like I..I DO LOVE HER BUT----I feel more committed to uraraka since we get to know her + follow her journey more!! As much as she can be a little much for me sometimes, ... my yoga prof is cool. She cut one of our writing assignments and lessened the requirements for another, and this is what she wrote: pic.twitter.com/WPvaPlJumf. I .. I ALMOST JUST GOOGLED "when is [friend's name]'s birthday?". OHH ITS CADY'S BIRTHDAY (probably -- she was found 'at 2 days old' so we don't really know LOL). SHES FOUR ALREADY HOW DID THIS HAPPEN......................... LRT I’m 2 usually! Sometimes my pajamas and comfy clothes overlap but usually 2. I’m sorry but this con has a literal flow chart to see which kind of vendor you should apply as so I followed it and they emailed me saying I’m wrong.....ARE U..Follow your own DAMN CHART................. I wrote a nice email back asking for clarification but my dude either you’re wrong or your flow chart is wrong. I wrote back like heres what your chart says, here’s what I make and how I make it, wtf do u want from me . “Hi since u don’t fit into either of our arbitrarily defined categories, regardless of what the chart we created says, u cannot vend at our con see u never” - the response I expect. LMFAOOO Me, in May, if I hadn’t talked to you: so are those marketplace apps going up soon or. BTW IM NOT TRYNA BE A DICK it’s just AA is suffering + every con has their own special way of making things confusing or difficult (make an account every year, arbitrary fan art limits that clearly are about $ not legality there, have your tax ID before APPLYING etc.)it’s tiring. Yeah it’s just like I know you’re trying but u did this u made this confusing when it didn’t have to be . “Check back for info in (month that passed)”, crashing servers, forced to choose which category of ONE ITEM TYPE to place yourself in even though almost everyone sells more than one kind of thing, broken links, “email us back to be put on the waitlist”, etc. OK IM DONE COMPLAINING LMFAOO. Anyways on today’s date of October 10th I have reclaimed my title as STRONGEST FOOL and my internal body temperature is now 5 degrees https:// twitter.com/cambrasine/sta tus/1048991927209807876   …. Big   mood. NICE!! Just think you haven’t even had them at cons yet!! She’s cute!! Mom: he actually threw his cigarette carton in the recycling bin
Me: I’m not sure how much that counts when he threw three cigarettes in our driveway. "hi yes my cards are not quite 5 by not quite 7 and slightly green but at least I had him reprint them because the first ones, as you can see, are perfect color-wise but have giant white bands running through them" - me@critique tomorrow. follow up to an older tweet
(looking at the same drawing as before)
mom: Jennie I really like these!
me: are you sure you don't wanna make fun of them again?
mom: noooo, I thought they were a professional's!!
me: OH SO NOW IM NOT A PROFES-----. do you Christmas? aizawa kitty tree.. ok i'm gonna try my silhouette on the foil again please pray for me. The power went out :( its way too quiettttt. It was 81 here yesterday and my mom must’ve hit “heat” on my remote so it’s so warm in here and now there’s no ac or fan djdjdjd raining too much to open window. Uhh I haven’t read it yet but it’s your story and you can do whatever you want with it! I’m happily along for the ride, with all its ups and downs . Ps sorry if this is abt something else entirely I’m half asleep . Ok any time people r gonna do work in the kitchen - sawing, drinking, plastering, painting - things that smell bad or send dust/debris everywhere - my mom will put up a tarp between the kitchen+dining rooms bc there’s no door and EVERY TIME NO MATTER WHO IT IS THEy TAKE IT DOWN. Like it wasn’t there for aesthetics dude!!! Anyway they painted today and my throat hurts one level and one closed door away . I just can’t believe people need pointed out to them that hey you don’t HAVE to keep looking at this if you don’t want to? . Here are my finished Chanukah cards! I also made a papercut dreidel! I think I'll post it and make it downloadable later?

I'm trying to decide whether or not to produce these cards with gold foil accents or without! Poll in replies! pic.twitter.com/elnGPiiVfB. Pic in OP! TWITTER CROPS KILL ME but anyway--
For reference, gold foil elements would be the text, the necklace on the woman (and maybe a ring or earring), and the gold embroidery lines on the tallis.  Thank you so much! I also wanna see how gold looks . Aaaaa thank you rin!! . “Oh no it’s banana fish day”. As usual — so uh how stress was banana fish today? Scale of 1 to 10 .. 1 being a spa day 10 being someone bringing up politics at thanksgiving dinner. LMFAOO I’m glad you’re enjoying my suffering at least   THIS IS NOTHING ANDY I haven’t even read up to this point or past it in the manga yet!! That’s when I die in real life

Ps WELCOME TO   H   E   L   L . OHHH I FORGOT THERES NEW OP AND ED THIS WEEEK AAAA maybe I’ll just watch that part and save myself from the rest til tomorrow haha

(Thank you for answering again!! ). Yeah I just like acknowledge I’m not in a good enough state rn to read it..maybe during a break   ALSO OMG YEET LUNG ANDY MAKE THE BUTTON RIGHT NOW. I FORGOT TO READ BNHA LAST WEeeeek
Tokoyami is soo coooool. IS THIS REAL LIFE omg. HNN BAKUGOUS WINTER OUTFIT IS SO COOL (still). LRT THIS IS SO FUN VISUALLY WOW!!! Anyway if u praise me I live off it for like three days 
ITS.. NICE
I do wish I could feel this way on my own though..is this Self Confidence? . My classmates said a lot of really nice things during crit yesterday..one said it looked so professional she felt like I bought it at a store+put it up for crit so I joked saying she was right and I worked backwards for my wips + my prof called me clever it makes me happy!!  ). At the same time I feel PRESSURED TO DO AS WELL ON THE NEXT PROJECT FOR WHICH I HAVE NO IDEAS wow my Brain sure is a tricky bitch. The way she said it reminded me of my grandma and I’ve been thinking a lot about her through the process of making these cards bc even tho I’m not v religious Judaism was important to her..and bc I have that family bat mitzvah tomorrow....... suddenly I want brisket ..damn LOL. Ok done w my stream of consciousness tweets LOL. Draw a friends oc instead? dnjdbdHDNDND I COULDNT SEE THAT CADY WAS BREATHING and her eyes were closed and I shook her and she didn’t respond and I had a freaking heart attack but she’s fine she’s just really tired I guess bc she slept on the floor upstairs instead of the plush couch (bc of paint fumes). Ugh what the fuck am i gonna wear to this bat mitzvah. i love c*tprint but they seem to reply to emails like once a day near closing so going back and forth with someone takes forever. u ever buy smth then immediately find it for 1/4 to 1/2 the price (eyes glaze over). LMFAOOO WHY WOULD U ANSWER AN AMAZON PRODUCT QUESTION IF THIS WAS WHAT U HAD TO SAY i'm pic.twitter.com/cHo5KZNzC1. LMFAOO ITS LIKE THEYRE WASTING YOUR TIME BUT ALSO THEIR OWN??? “where’s my soft boy?” - actual thing I said aloud when looking for my 6B pencil. I don’t have the creative storyline or patience for a proper doujin but I’d like to make like a kiribaku mini comic compilation zine. MICHELLE THESE ARE BEAUTIFUL.  thank you!! I wanna make it but we’ll see if time permits.. Employee: yeah u could wear that to class, just throw on a pair of jeans 
Me: bold of u to assume I own pants that aren’t stretchy. This needs 3000 more notes wth. So many of fave artists are in omocats fall line up aaaaaa. Idk who Shannon is but they have good taste. I’m /still/ waiting on both orders but damn it’s gonna feel so good getting these preorders out when I can. Time to play overdress or underdress?   Has anyone been to a bar/bat mitzvah in the last few years? I haven’t been to once since I was that age. Omg that’s an amazing method!! Tbh it’s my bougie relatives and the invite is classy so guess I’m gonna really go for it LOL. probably gonna return this after but \o/ pic.twitter.com/R3PoWgOpQa. also these should not be worn together but comfy gets from the trendy new store at the mall i've been meaning to go to for months (but i never go to the mall..)
also my room is a disaster i am Aware pic.twitter.com/vm1YG9OvtM. it's ridiculous how much my views on prices are colored by the environment???
me@a thrift shop: $9? hm pretty good.. 
me@a mall: $30??? OUTRAGEOUS!! I COULD GET THIS AT A THRIFT SHOP FOR $9
me@a small local shop: yeah ok I'll pay $60 for this. RIGHT?? It was the first thing that caught my eye when I walked in the store I was like 'THIS IS IT'
It's pretty soft, too!! me: ah time to just relax for the evening...
me: OH GOD I DIDNT WATCH BANANA FISH YEt. Update I watched the new OP/ED and w o w !!! The animation in the OP is so pretty and the illustrations and music in the ED are gorgeous tooooo * U*. Thank you * U* i'm v happy with it.. should i watch new banana fish and then new miraculous so i can get fucking WHIPLASH. stabby murder nightmare followed by a show where literally everything is always fine. like at the end of every episode everything is Fixed why is banana fish not like that. OK I WATCHED THIS WEEKS BANANA FISH Y'ALL THIS LOOKS LIKE ITLL BE bAD fuuuuuck I mean . Everyone says it only gets worse idk why i'm Surprised. my mom keeps applying to the Hamilton lottery
"MOM We'RE NOT GONNA WIN HAMILTON TICKETS"
"but jenn on the weekends there's twice as many to win!". please feed us. FROZEr...IM WATCHING IT NOW...THEYRE BOTH MAKING SUCH CUTE LITTLE POUTY FACES IM CANretrdhbgfc. I..I CANT FIND THE END OF FROZER IT CUTS OFF SEND HELP. uhhh ok I couldn't find the last minute or so in English so I watched it in Portuguese. idk Portuguese but I got the gist--- I'm -- -he literally asked you me and you!!! you were so close bby girl Aaaa. ANYWAY FROZER WAS REALLY GOOD !? The pacing was SOOOO much better than the average episode and it was good to see the beginnings of these two looking deeper into their feelings and all that! Aaa yeah I feel that! You're right! I think it's really obvious the difference in things like fast fashion vs handmade too!! i'm sweating in my sweater :(. Take your time! <3 We'll be here . Me: was this posted back when the episode air 
Time stamp: no. I didn’t post about it here I think but just in case - I ended up not doing the BABF this weekend. with the family event taking place a chunk of Saturday it wasn’t practical. I didn’t have someone to cover and I just didn’t get to prepare what I wanted to for it. I’m also..tired. I was in a bad headspace for a bit I think I would’ve burnt me out completely. I rly hope I can get in next year+bring some screen printed tees/totes, and more importantly printed material: journals, zines, riso prints! If you ask my fam/friends they’ll tell you I went back and forth a million times agonizing over this, and even though I’m disappointed in myself and the situation, it was the right call. I’m sorry to anyone I disappointed, I hope you still check it out cause it seems really rad! OHMYGODNDJDND. I’m so stressed about this stupid thing tonight. I feel gross. I laid in bed all day too. Ugh. People do this shit all the time so I stopped replying to people who don’t even try. If you’re friends or even fairly good acquaintances I don’t mind helping you out, I’ll go out of my way! but if you just pretend to like my art OR SOME PEOPLE DONT EVEN BOTHER PRETENDING like.pls. I’m p sure no ones saying everyone should have a hard time. I’ve experienced firsthand sources getting too popular and quality dropping, mistakes and turnaround times increasing. Just put in an ounce of effort dude yknow. Me neither!! This person’s just tooting their own horn I guess   they’ll know how it feels when they start getting late and fucked up orders because they told ten people who each told ten people and— . Yeah they’re both bad in their own special way. Like I know a few people who only are friendly when they want shit so I know not to get too close ; n;  sad but just how it is. Every relative: oh wow Jennifer you look so different! So grown up! 
Internally: yeah well that’s what happens when you don’t invite us to anything for two years. I don’t care that much aside from it’s just kinda sad, but my mom really, really cared and my grandma would’ve cared a lot too and would be disappointed that they just dropped us after she died. I’m too old and too young to be here  The only people here my age are the servers...hello pls take a break and stand awkwardly next to meeeee. The plan was to come to the party very briefly say hi then leave after dinner but it’s been two hours it’s 9 pm and all they’ve served is one (1) slice of bread..p..please I’m hungry and I wanna go home. Update: a large plate has been placed in front of me. It is empty. More to come. LMFAOO THEYRE PLAYING SOULJA BOY these kids were 0 when this came out bc I was like 12 and they look so lost. Anyway that was 9 hours of my life from start to finish including commute and we left like 4 hours into the party part and it was still before dessert ?! ohhh! That's neat! I didn't know that! But uh yeah like they even made exclude filters now!!! Yeah!! I think it was really smart to make the exclude filters and it'll definitely help people avoid content that triggers them or even that they just aren't into which is pretty rad! But yeah I 100% agree with you. and ao3 isn't the only website that allows users to publish content?! tumblr, twitter, blogs, reddit, etc. --  any social media site is the same way.. me everytime stickermule runs a promotion: wow that's pretty rad, and it goes til X (date), that gives me some time
me, the day after X: oh shit. lrt the nude + gold version...fuck yeah. LRT  https://www. etsy.com/shop/LirikaMat oshi   …. yesterday I almost made (or did make? I don't remember) about how awful tights were and now i'm looking at Lirika Matoshi's work like * Q*. ME ALWAYS, MOST RECENTLY WITH @KomunHorangi  I was like "I thought a shop I wanted to buy from closed on this day but GUESS NOT" then everyone starts getting their orders frmo her and i'm like LTJRHGFH GHGJFDG GH. big mood. it may be physically challenging, given the distance, but i'm willing to try (stretches legs). hnn relatable..I don't know when I became a forgetful person but I did and it sucks. I literally set reminders for events i've been looking forward to for months bc i'm a mess. hnnn can someone help me find the post where 'lord explosion murder' is explained as a pun in japanese?! <3 <3 <3. i'm soo excited for miceeeee. They did that last year too! I’m crying tho cause one of the things they liked was smth I painted when I was like 16......... I just gave up on a tweet I was making bc I couldn't condense it into one tweet and it didn't feel like it deserved two. I wish!! Usually the illustration head (or someone) sends out an email for students to apply for Lesley's spots but I didn't get an email this year?! I thought 'maybe they're sending it late' and then school /ended/ a week later so... I'm gonna try next year for sure! But I'll definitely be going at least one day!! * U*. LMFAO NO IT WASN'T IMPORTANT AT ALL it was a very detailed account about how hard it was to find a bat mitzvah card hahahah. BUT I APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT <3. I'll keep an eye out for you too!! I haven't even looked at the exhibitor list yet :O
Have you been before? OH! Well it's in the mall building - there's vendors both downstairs and upstairs so make sure you go to both parts! It can be really cramped - vendors are in small rooms+narrow hallways so if u/ur friends aren't good w crowds just keep that in mind! It gets a little overwhelming. lrt TT A TT I hATE THAT THEY HAve to keep secrets from each other........... These pics are a week old but !! 
Look at this beautiful girl. She had a good birthday - ran in circles with some dogs, waded, destroyed some poor unsuspecting person's sand artwork as I tried to photograph it --- what more could she ask for? pic.twitter.com/OKqQgG70pI. The sunset was so beautiful. It was like a pastel rainbow in the sky and the ocean...

Also, I FUCKING SWAM IN THE OCEAN IN OCTOBER..
Also, you can see, Cady doesn't swim even though she has webbed feet.. pic.twitter.com/6PmqwuCGUC. bonus --- memeing:
> cryptid
> stick the leggy out real far pic.twitter.com/egbRRhKo8y. packages are a nightmare. me: maybe I can ignore my homework and finish this comic tonight
comic: (i'm less than 1/3 done u fool)
me: oh, right. me: ohh did I just see hebrew letters on my TL?! (scrolls to find it) 
me: oh yikes that's not what I wanted. mom: (something about) "Neil Sedaka"
me: ..Tzedakah?!
mom: ..Sedaka. i feel called out. can't believe you're kink shaming me,, and in public like this. DFGRRJHhdtyh . It’s a nightmare if I want to look up the price of an item out of curiosity I go into incognito mode :| otherwise I’ll get ads for it for literally 3 weeks.....idk how people who look at like uhh nefarious things would survive . I read this shit way back when and as soon as the clone(?)stuff started I was like I’m so confused I’m out but it’ll always be special to me!! Big mood. IVE HAD THAT HAPPEN TOO   it’s always the cheesiest ads too Ohmygod 

Don’t quote me on icognito mode tho -// I THINK it works but idk that it’s fool proof. Ohmygod I’ve never looked at it that way before...that’s...an amazing interpretation. Me two weeks ago: wow it’s his bday in two weeks
Me rn, with nothing to show: ......... MASSACHUSETTS —- you’ve got just a couple more days to register to vote!! DO THAT. IM LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS A LOT. c*tpr*nt, a full hour ago: ok we'll get ya a new quote
me: ............... 
I WAITED ALL WEEKEND PLS MY CROPS ARE DYING. I CAN RECOGNIZE MY KIDS IN ANY COLOR LEAD. lmfaoo poor tamaki,,he' s t r y i   n g. i've wanted to see this band since i was like. a baby. and it's today/ 
i just got so tired
zzzzz
ZzZZZZZZZzzzgosh. Mom: your laptop is at 81%, is that good?
Me: you know me, I like to keep it . Aaaa looks like a beautiful day. I should get up. Ugh ow I normally get a pang here or there but this is the first time in years I’m having full on pain outside my period and like I don’t need this right now? They never have anything to help except bc pills bc no one cares about women.I can’t do a month of side effects rn either. Ow fuck ok nvm guess it’s early but still it interfering w me going to class once a month isn’t ok either. The timing is so bad I missed the same class a month ago for the same reason grrrrr prof is male too. Like wtf am I supposed to tell this guy “sorry I think it’ll be hard to paint when I’m rocking back and forth bc my uterus is trying to escape the confines of my body”. He’s gonna be like this chick never comes to class cause I missed one bc I didn’t feel like it which would be ok if I didn’t miss TWO now for the start of my period grjdjdndkdndhd. Me: I don’t feel good will you read over my email before I send it
Mom: uh it says “I will /not/ be absent today”?
Me: .................. Gonna try for class #2 but sometimes the pain starts again as soon as I start moving so we’ll see..yhhdndndn. Officer: (SLAMS HANDS ON INTERROGATION TABLE) 
Look, nie, we know you did it..the question is /why/. WHY DID YOU KILL THIS MAN?
nie: Well officer, it was pretty 50/50 him or me at first, but then I realized he could spread my poetry even after I died, so I did what I had to do. Hmm I’m trying to decide not only if I feel well enough, but also even if it’s worth it to travel 2 hours for my 2 hour class..I haven’t missed any of that class so far (6 absences allowed) and it’s all just work time today so it feels kinda stupid to schlepp in and out. “kiryeetshima eiyeetrou” is a thing I just typed

Please send complaints to @andythelemon_. Is there a way to block myself. yessss finally got my finished quote from c*tpr*nt...they still didn't change the paper type (I thought it may be too hard to fold the dreidel on heavy cardstock vs light) but i'll see how it is in person -- hard copy proofs in 3-5 biz days (eyes emoji). LMFAO I MUST HAVE..STARTED WRITING A PRODUCT DESCRIPTION THE OTHER DAY BUT IT JUST SAYS "Bonus: YOU GET A FUUUCKING DREIDEL BROOOOOOOO". did you mean /kiribaku/?
I say this only bc I know you fucking do. fun fact if you use someone as an alibi you should tell that person or - and hear me out - don't do things that require you having an alibi. OHMYGOD MINE IS HERE AND WEARING A RILAKKUMA HAT?! SHITTY DAY IMPROVED 1000%. GOOD NEWS THO Wix finally offered me the coupon again so I got 50% off my site for a year \o/ yay! omg I'm glad you found a use for them!! They look so cute on your plushes!! hehehe I'm glad you love him so much --- he grin! > U<. mmmm my prof, who typically sends multiple emails to the class DURING CLASS, didn't send me crit so now i'm like twiddling my thumbs over here. I figure by the time it's time to renew i'll know if i need the store part or not but it's going well so far? So brave...... Illustrator scares me. Buttons should be here Friday or Monday!! I was gonna dm but I was like they’ll prob see this HAHA
Ps just FYI they gave themselves 45 days instead of the usual 15 days to complete it so just so you know if you order for a deadline . Yeah I didn’t ask bc it’s always been 15 for me and then when I looked at the clock later I was like UHHH WHAT . Yeah it probably is ??? I hope? I like your twitter name btw
 Cambrasine  doesn’t spoop-ify easily. Omg those are both v good...cambraspoop? Looks like I just added poop instead of spoop LOL. LMFAOOO YOURE GOOD AT THIS. OUCH ... Can’t believe our kitchen is almost a functioning room after over 1 year of living here and almost 3 full months under construction bc they kept taking multi-week breaks. The pure satisfaction of our microwave being in our kitchen instead of balancing precariously on top of a piece of foam board on a piece of our bathroom vanity, which was in the dining room...... I’m crying, 28 hours later my prof sends me a fully lowercase letter email where she writes pokey instead of pocky and her main feedback was make it less blobby. I’m also gonna be late to this party - seeing it Sunday hopefully ! Aaaa we played episode one of LiS2 today . Same   There’s..quite a bit of it going around. THE QUESTION IS: Am I ready to suffer?? 
The buttons will be in Fri or Mon too !! LMFAO WOW DAMN OK uh I have vol 2 and 3 only..prob wouldn’t buy all 10 at once I like to suffer slowly lmfao. I’m glad there’s hype tho. Mmmmmm I ended up talking to one of my think classmates and somehow convinced her I’m Cool but we’re really incompatible   wumpwamp. So about that banana fish

This week’s episode, stress level scale of one to ten ..I ran out of creative metaphors sorry LOL.  good thing I met w my teacher last when everyone else had left cause we got to talking about how hard it is to support people w addiction issues and I cried like 3 times rip. I also met w my other prof (instead of having midterm tests or whatever) and he was really nice he was like if you need winter break to catch up you can have it and I’m like NO DONT GIVE ME THAT MUCH TIME. Anyway all my professors are really nice and I need to calm the fuck down always. When I sign up for classes I always look up the professor to see what people say about them so idk why I’m surprised when they’re nice LMFAOO. HAHAHA I ASKED MY MOM TO GET ME A HAPPY MEAL and apparently this was the dialogue 
“I have to ask now - is this for you or a child?”
“It’s for my daughter, I just picked her up from school”
“School? It’s awfully late”
“Uhhh music class..”
“...Pokémon or Hello Kitty”
“Oh god uh”. I AM HER DAUGHTER I JUST AM ALSO 22. i'm a whole ass adult ok pic.twitter.com/8WTLaSWosa. I love this sweatshirt but somehow i never remember what it says so any time i think of it my brain just goes 'midnight nya-nya-nyas'. THANK YOU It was a happy coincidencec. I was so frazzled that I didn't grab a fork so I ate mac and cheese with my bare hands today I love College. OH NO ok I'm siting at the island in the kitchen and I was like aw poor cady these stools are too high, she can't rest her head on my lap and snag my crumbs so I GUESS INSTEAD SHES JUST POKING MY BUTT W HER NOSE THRU THE OPEN BACK OF THE STOOL???THANKS. HES A TIGER IM CRYING. LRT PLEASEBUY ALL OF THESE (----AND GIVE ME ONE WHILE YOU'RE AT IT). /SOB I didn't..get into anyc........If school isn't kicking my ass I may go for fun and if so I WILL GLADLY RECEIVE HIM :O 
I hope they come in time so you can sell 1000 of them TT A TT They're so precious. want draw 
too slepp. Hey risograph people uh are the colors and how they print pretty standard? Like can I reference a color chart online and expect fairly similar results from any riso machine? LRT NO THANKS. I don’t know anything about it but dear lord it’s already a minimum of $14 to send *anything* rigid (aka not paper) overseas . LRT IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THESE FOR YEARS AND THERES NO FUCKING KIRISHIMA I feel personally attacked what the hell . Seriously I can’t get over this I just wanted a boy guhhhhh. I cleared today completely bc it’s supposed to be 60 and yet it’s still in the 40’s hereeeeee mmmm hurry and warm up..it’s too cold to get outta bed. Wow buttons were late af but they gave me a lot extra!!! I COULD HAVE Sent a better photo aaaa. At least they’ll always have deku . New star buttons! I made these mostly for myself but they gave me more extra than anticipated so you can get the set on sale for $10 (Individual $5) at  http:// Cambrasine.art   pic.twitter.com/ir5pZq32lz.

Casually makes ita bag w own merch. ahha My friend has also taken to commissioning people to draw a character then asking for their permission to print one acrylic charm to use on her ita bag. aaa tomorrow's gonna be really nice but if I go to MICE sunday instead then things are more likely to be sold out.. one of the shirts from omocat fall line up I love has crosses on it + I just remembered when I was in 1st grade my grandma saw a paper I brought home from (jewish) school and she was like THEY LET YOU DRAW CROSSES AT SCHOOL? and I was like..grandma I drew a bubble letter 't'. IM WATCHING EIGHTH GRADE IM SO UNCOMFORTABLE. ok i'm gonna watch banana fish i'm scared y'all. WOULD YOU SAY ITS.../BANANA/ FISHY????  pic.twitter.com/jnA9VVoisw.

2 of my fave boys are finally together (Eiji and Sing), Ash's performance was So Much, Max + Shunichi in the tour group...shit's about to go Down and I know it's gonna get worse from here but this week was enjoyable. Can I just say on no other website but Etsy have people bought something then immediately asked for it to be cancelled? This is like the 3rd time?

I'm not a dick, what do I know, maybe they need the $ for smth important so I'll do it but that's not how shopping works my dudes. GAHH PROBABLY BC I THINK THATS WHERE WE MET LAST YEAR? I may go for fun..I haven't cancelled my hotel res yet.... it's just like damn all you did was make more work for me LMFAO. I have to go downstairs before I can make any more progress on orders ............can someone carry me. (softly) y...your entire store is sold out is this..................a mistake or a cruel reality LMFAO. uh...A..X.......
THAT'S ALL I'VE GOTTEN INTO SO FAR................. why is death cab for cutie so good
I wish I'd had time to refresh before the concert last week
here's a good one I didn't know before it https://www. youtube.com/watch?v=KjntY- m5dFk   …. I still haven't decided whether to go to MICE tomorrow or sunday but I'll bring some buttons or stickers or smth to give away and post a selfie and whatever to let ya know i'm there + how I look !! I hope we'll run into each other <3. ITS TWO AM AND ITS GONNA BE BEAUTIFUL TOMORROW BUT IM NAILING THIS DRAWING RN AND IM TOO SCARED TO STOP. me: do you like my strawberries?
mom: they're AAWWWWFULL..ly cute
me: are you tryna give me a heart attack. How many times do you think Ash’s seiyuu had to sing that song in the booth y’all. Do you think he caught himself singing it quietly at home while doing mundane tasks this is very important LMFAO. Customer: Hi, do you have x, y, z?
Comicopia: I’m sorry, we only carry banana fish now (gestures to endless bookshelves of bright yellow manga). GUHH my brain is so annoying! I’m excited for mice but I just feel anxious and can’t sleep..idk if I’m even going /today/... I wanna check the mailbox for my card proofs but I feel like they’re not there. They said sent via USPS but didn’t say whether it was priority or first class, or provide tracking so I’m just waiting impatiently. I wasn’t able to send the packages today bc my printer ran out of magenta so I couldn’t print off bonus buttons   The nearest place that sells ink is 40 min roundtrip so I’ll get some tonight - just don’t get nervous if your package isn’t scanned til Monday morning! If you ordered Banana Fish buttons and it wasn’t combined with any preorder items then you should have received your tracking#last night . He’s back in the ER. got my hopes up even though I know better. I thought things were different this time. Look for me at MICE for the last hour bc I had to calm down for a bit before heading out  

Sorry in advance if I’m not super peppy   BUT —- i have stickers and buttons w me so feel free to say hi  pic.twitter.com/kyXP6Y3gCs. I’ll be back again tomorrow bc I didn’t have enough time today   I’ll post again with what I’m wearing so I can hand more stuff out!! https:// twitter.com/cambrasine/sta tus/1053739402390892544   …. We had such a lovely time the other night..and he started regaining his interests and I was so happy for him for like, 12 hours . I love. OMG.. DID...WE RUN INTO EACH OTHER WITHOUT KNOWING IT!?..... It was definitely Otakon, right??! ok~~~ button orders are all packed and by the door u vu <3. now if my charms will just arrive..................  
I've had really long production times w them on and off since spring so it may be time to look into new options..... hello art friends, since I missed one class last missed a round of crit soooo ..h...help? 
I think the thing that's bothering me is how there's strong lines on the characters but lineless  s..........but I don't like how   look w lines....

does it look weird or is it just me pic.twitter.com/PJGWBBDVEy. also i'm really proud of how i drew that stick of pocky on the side with relative ease?! aaa no I wasn't at ANEXT, so it was def ota!!! WHEEZE IM SORRY.. I LIKE..REMEMBER THAT HAPPENING BUT I...don't specifically remember you orz I was pretty exhausted/getting sick that weekend too... I hope we can meet properly someday!! . aaaa I was so happy when anyone recognized banana fish that weekend HAHA WEll... I STILL AM but it's def getting more popular (eyes emoji)
next time I'll throw this prettier heart-shaped version at you!!! ..or whatever banana fish merch I've drummed up before then haha. @ neemo_chan  y'all..that's fair -- in my wip they were flat, I just had fun coloring them lmfao pic.twitter.com/Qx5FDOBphZ. colored line pocky, lineless pocky, outlined berries black, white pic.twitter.com/TfZ6imCkpy. although some other friends pointed out the highlights on the berries suggesting 3d vs 2d/flatness of characters may actually be the problem!? pic.twitter.com/aE4AlrnJ0c. yeah y'all are so right... I think this does look better... I WAS SO HAPPY W HOW I DREW THEM THO LMFAOOO rest in pieces
THANK YOU <3 <3 <3. :( trying to get cady to eat in the kitchen since it's practically done and she's yawning and licking her lips like she's stressy?! if you lie to someone with the intention of telling them the truth later you still...lied to them......................... :|. OH NOW MY TA IS FOLLOWING ME ON INSTA /anxiety intensifies. Anyway joey almost died today and I can’t look at this pocky packaging anymore I’m real tired SO

Ah as soon as I stopped distracting myself I started feeling my guts twist again. He wanted to kill himself and he almost fucking did. I should have paid more attention. At the beginning of our hang out he said it only half joking and I knew he was only HALF joking but we spent so many happy hours together after that and nothing came up again. it faded into the background for me and I was too focused on how happy I felt since we had fun.. Wheeze..my face is so puffy.. MICE again today! Say hi for free stuff   I’ll have my kiri ita bag too so it’ll be hard to miss~ pic.twitter.com/bwN5s2boT1.

One of my profs names is Diane and it’s really fun to say her name mock angrily when she does smth that wasn’t exactly what I requested. Me: I’m not done but can I have critique

LIKE OBJECTIVELY IT REALLY WASNT THAT BAD OF A MOVIE AND PERSONALLY I REALLY ENJOYED IT!! we ended up reminiscing abt idk what but i just remembered in middle school when this kid liked me and the school psychologist kept pushing us together and all his pics on fb were like him hunting w guns and stuff. My proofs SHOULD arrive by tomorrow the latest. Whaddya think. Is there new Miraculous today cause I could really use it. The next 10 days are 44-50 degrees....no. This is so cute I died.

I found some I like but aside from saying 'eco friendly' it doesn't really say uh /how/?! Like is it made from recycled materials? Is it designed differently than the average mailer? I MESSAGED THEM BUT IM SKEPTICAL. they're really pretty tho. LRT I WANT SOME SO BADly........doesn't look like they sell/online tho? not that I can read anything--.

Charms are coming today so those will all be out by Saturday the latest. Going to try to squeeze them in before then tho. Local dumbass forgets to put hole at bottom of charm. i'm glad my prof likes me but she's like YOURE GONNA DO GREAT W THIS and i'm over here w 0 ideas like please lower your expectations. Aaa this girl I wanna be friends w seems to be taking screen this semester. I hope I see her in the studio and we get to chat more!! She was there just now when all I could do was drop my screens off but if she goes from the class we have to the studio on tuesdays then we’ll be there at the same time!!

Packing pin club stuff tonight!! ok!! did a mini batch of packages for tomorrow (pin club + store orders)
The rest of them will go out on friday/saturday~. birb
also OUCH I wish I was Recovery Girl rn. i want those banana fish plush but i can't decide if they'll be cheaper somewhere else that's not a*tai/k*ji since i've heard mixed reviews..
also I wannt know if the secret is shorter.. I hope it's shorter..or sing.......if it's yut-lung I'll be a bit sad (sorry). I'll look but its like....it says 'prize at game center'. aaa yeah i tend to have bad luck with packages so i'm a bit nervous LOL .....
I haven't bought this kind of thing so I wasn'ts ure if it was overpriced or not..some of their items are clearly overpriced and some not so bad so it's hard to tell when i'm not familiar. LMFAOO I showed my mom tsumtsum deku (hero version) and she said
"It looks like a deku caterpillar" . :( I checked, they don't carry it;; haven't found anyone who does yet..it's a game center prize so it's harder to find I think? it'd more be like..yahoo auctions or smth after the fact. my mom is laying down in another room but I sent her a pic of the bnha tsum pyramid and she's CRACKING UP. OH YIKES. I was just about to cave but hnn y...yeah that's the thing is I hear a lot of 'i've never had any problems' and a lot of 'i never got my order and no one gave a single fuck' . ohhh something i thought was due thursday is due in TWO thursdays..i am ...relieved. AFIEHRSGRTDH ITS MY MOMS BIRTHDAY TOMORROW 
and
mom: I'm 57....
me: ....mom ... you're turning 56...MOM...do you not know how old ---
mom: ......OH SHIT I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA BE 58 ...thank god..that's not so bad... I'm 110% SERIOUS. GUH ebay is a nightmare where people sell bootleg stuff, stolen artist merch, and official merch marked up 500%... i'd rather buy from yahoo auctions japan or whatever other japanese secondhand site my friend is always ordering from.. YEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH I did pic.twitter.com/U5jhdaaTmb. I'm sorry you had such a bad experience :(. my prof: tarot cards
me: time to draw some naked ladies u wu. I almost put soft soap on my toothbrush. Ooo I get to take proper photos of my pins and new charms tomorrow!!  There are some teasers on my Instagram story ~. I didn’t realize there was a second hero version nitotan of deku . Post this on insta too u fool. I’m glad this is on my feed rn bc I was not blessed by this image many months ago 
I lol’d. I’ll post on my insta story later ! I need this in my living room, framed. Same... Ohhh you~~ pic.twitter.com/fiGrY2nNiu. Public transportation is a nightmare. Luckily my fear of getting on the wrong vehicle and ending up some random place and not knowing how to get back is greater than my social anxiety   gotta ask peeps if it’s the right one. I love my Bakuboy but I have a bag for deku and uraraka is looking so cute wtf
I haven’t bought any...yet 
I also want the banana fish plush and bnha tsums so I’m tryna decide and buy one .. If only they had made kiri in either set this wouldn’t be a hard decision. (Softly) will the big 3 be in this set? Aaa ok!! I hope I can get my hands on them someday!  Still excited to see who’s here tho! FORGOT TO ORDER ECOFRIENDLY BUBBLE MAILERS

I GOT NOTHING DONE IN THE STUDIO LOL. OHHHH WE GOT OFF THE WAITING LIST FOR COLBERT TIX THE THURS BEFORE ANYC SO NOW I CAN GO THERE OM FRIDAY !!! I’m excited!! It was hard to justify going for anyc only but now there’s *two things*   even if I’m not tabling I’m excited to see some friends and throw $ at them in the aa. Thank you for dealing w and voting in my polls tonight !! hehehe banana fish was fun again this week!! 
Ash has gotta go find his boyfriend!! I wonder what Eiji and Sing are up to anyway? Like they agreed Ash wasn't dead but that was all they showed so far....I should really read the manga. MISTTTYYYY 
i feel like you're teasing me :P. wheeee gonna be blond(er) tomorrow! I changed this appoint *~three times~* so I'm happy to finally get there !! REALLY?! USUALLY PEOPLE JUST GO "ITS ALL DOWNHILL FROM HERE" SO THIS IS THE KIND OF NEWS I WANT <3 <3 <3. You know I’m out of whack when I haven’t read bnha manga in like three weeks..maybe I’ll catch up while sitting for my hair.. I’ve had Very Little sleep again today so Happy birthday Joey I’m gonna eat fancy food sit in a hot tub til I get dizzy then pass out on the bed. I’m excited to eventually rewatch banana fish - it seems like it would be a totally different experience the second time through. Aaaaaa I’m getting HYPED. You should call them ASAP in case they think you should give him the stuff to make him vomit it up... Maybe it was just the satisfaction of doing smth he shouldn’t . OHH I GOT FREE CARDBOARD LMFAOO free cardboard GET. pic.twitter.com/soyhUWRiK9. pic.twitter.com/46MrF96TiS. Birthday boy is tuckered out  pic.twitter.com/vIzDL7Jk2T. Asdfghjj the right side of my face is swollen from sinus issues.... fuuuuck I feel awful.. I just ate for the first time today..I have concert tix for tonight but idk if i'm up to it.. I took medicine but it didn't do anything guh. big yikes.. I know someone here who lost power but we're ok so far.. lrt cursed. last time  in town we were the first people to lose power and last to get it back bc we're a dead end street and no one gave a fuck. SHE LOOKS REALLY HAPPY THO LMFAO. can't believe i'm living in this fucking dystopia where we'll need metal detectors at every school and place of worship that's not a white church. Shnfndjsbs   Thank you... i do love big bows . This guy was on his phone watching basketball and then baseball throughout the ENTIRE. concert
Even when he went to get beer he left it on and playing in front of us pic.twitter.com/vqlHkr7ysh. That’s disrespectful to the performers, the people whot paid to be there who you’re distracting from enjoying the concert, and the people who actually cared abt the band and weren’t able to go bc you took this seat. His girlfriend asked him to record ONE song for her - and halfway through he started watching his game again on his phone at the same time so the video was completely crooked so she nudged his hand into position then eventually gave up+took it from him.Girl - you deserve better. Anyway @thehalocline  was AMAZING live, so I hope to see them again soon without this freakin’ guy sitting in front of me . Aaa I’m getting a stockpile of small presents (zines/prints) for my big bro!  I’m excited for him to come home and we’ll go see live music and stuff! Last time all 3 of us were stressed out and making it worse for each other so hopefully we can all relax this time around!! any time I lose or forget my tablet pen I have a small existential crisis. everyone's getting all spoopy but i have no halloween plans u nu 
My mom's tryna convinced me it'll be more exciting this year cause one (1) more family moved in down the street............... PS Everyone who is getting packages in this batch - I'M SO SORRY FOR THE UGLY FRANKENSTEIN'D PACKAGES.. the new ecofriendly mailers aren't arriving til mid next week even w priority shipping and I'd rather not make y'all wait longer so....sorry about all the tape!! For a moment I thought this was in Fahrenheit and I was Very Concerned. Can you believe my school just sent an email essentially reminding people not to burn down the town because of the World Championship. Like it says we know this can cause strong emotions and remind you that we can kick your ass out if you do smth stupid . I sent a nice photo of myself for the wall o “who’s allowed to be in here” for the screen studio and it’s really deceiving bc I’m never gonna look that nice when I go to print - no make up, greasy hair, ink-stained clothes . { RTs   }

Get It:  https:// gum.co/diydreidel   pic.twitter.com/OhsQJNEM41. WHEEZE cady hates the groomer (But she was smelly and it's too cold now..) and they still haven't called....hellooo?,..my dog,,,please? I am giving it to the cashier bc someone’s gonna buy it otherwise omg pic.twitter.com/duqJ6DFzQt. We were using cady’s birthday coupon ($10 Free) and she picked smth that was .99 ..a very good girl LMFAO. # pantoneproblems 
enamel pins are the second most stressful merch to make LOL. (the first is PLUSH). good scales for assessing the state of my mental health: 
> how frequently I've been flossing my teeth
> how far behind I am on bnha manga
> how big the pile of clothes in my room is. ily shippinge*sy but why the fuck don't my etsy customer notes carry over?! time to slice some packages open hnnn. I'm sure this differs from person to person but for me from easy to hard:
prints > buttons (that someone else presses) > buttons (that I press) > charms (esp if they have effects like foil/transparency) > zines (painful to assemble the file) > enamel pins > plush. aaa I hope we can catch up on our reading soon!! LOL looks like the postal service is creeping on them
I'M GLAD I NOTICED THO OR THESE BDAY PRESENTS WOULD BE MISSING MESSAGES AND SAY THANKS FOR BUYING LMFAO. lrt i love a terrible fashion boy. i dont wanna pay extra to get this wig in time for anyc but i also know i wont get the other one untangled and then i wont cosplay and then i'll be sad. I have class on Tuesday, but not Wednesday (Halloween)...
what do :(. Oh. I actually went a little crazy and did all my packages but 4, 2 of which have to wait anyway so...good? But I did no homework orz. The contractor has been ghosting my mom since the middle of last week yet someone shows up here at 7 o fucking clock I’m so mad I’m so tired I have so much to do what the fuck. I was in such a deep sleep for once that I got a headache just from being ripped out of it like that. Omg I put off these birthday doodles til last but they’re kinda fun heh. Birthday doodle for a customer u vu pic.twitter.com/Jx7kkvy1e0. Mom: We need to make Kiri and Deku pumpkins!
Me: That’s a rarepair 
Mom: Wait, no..Deku and Todoroki!
Me: 
Mom: Wait no, who’s..Deku and Bakugou?
Me: 
Mom: NO— KIRIBAKU!! And but wait - who’s Deku with? Todoroki?
Me: I MEAN /TECHNICALLY/ NO ONE’S WITH NO ONE BUT-. Oh god is she gonna start getting hate mail. hnn I wanna improve enough to get into anyc next year.. that one hURT THE MOST---. nearly all my friends got in and it's so nearby and at such a good time of year and wahhh..gotta get..back in!! . My bank won’t give me a credit card, but they preapproved me for a $15,000 loan ... I don’t want a $15k loan I want to start building my stupid credit!!  . yeah I literally can't manage to get one..even through my own bank ,,,bc i have no credit....but i can't..build my credit...without......... (looks into camera). my mom just pointed out i've been singing the wrong words to a song by one of my favorite bands i feel so attacked. lrt can't believe we're voting on this in MA? why do we keep going backwards!?! omg .. well one place keeps trying to give me one with a like 28% interest rate . big 2016-on vibes from this song
 https://www. youtube.com/watch?v=N3eb5g 9NH30   …. Hnn yeah even when I research way ahead of time how I'm voting I always have a small panic in the booth rereading it 1000 times /just to make sure/. I feel like recently everyone else is voting on whether to give these rights or not meanwhile here we are in MA where they /already exist/ + we're voting on whether to /take them away/?! What absolute crap.. THIS IS SO AGGRESSIVE? like idk who this is but does it matter cause he's /8/,...people really have nothing better to do than tell a child on the internet that they don't like them. when someone draws a good crona i  wanna marry them. LRT GOOD BUT YOU STILL GOTTA GO DO THE THING (Vote). LRT SHOCKING NEWS. HNNN I PAID THE STUPID EXTRA MONEY FOR SHIPPING I really hope this arrives in time for anyc or i'll be sad and also crying on a pile of frizzed wig fibers. are u ever so tired that instead of drawing, say, the homework that's due tomorrow, you just draw portraits of a dozen girls instead. i'm..sleepy..doodling freely with no consequences is easy...coloring and cleaning up these drawings for class is Not. omg today joey ran into the kid that introduced us to each other /seven years ago/. aaa the red is a beautiful color but i personally prefer the blue one? If you already have smth red it may be better to get something different anyway, so it won't clash if the reds aren't similar enough? But it's all up to personal taste so go with your gut!   Both are v cute. Here’s a few  of them pic.twitter.com/gyCRSKhdss. I just.. -stares at wall-. (Start of class)
Prof: the flowers look good! Maybe add some stems or something
Me, internally: they’re mushrooms but I’ll just let it go and Not do that
(End of class)
Prof: wow, they almost look like mushrooms on a tree now!
Me: ... More pic.twitter.com/aQwUpAbhSY. It’s 45 feels like 38 and I just saw someone in shorts and flip flops on a moped. I am seriously my own worst enemy. I had a breakdown last night abt these drawings, restless sleep bc they weren’t finished enough, set alarms to get up early to work on them them but too tired to get up, etc

Then I get in here, my prof+classmate literally oohed + aahed@them. self confidence: what is it? Where can I buy it? She’s trying to recruit me to take her classes next semester which is nice but they’re all 8 AM. THIS PLACE IS A NIGHTMARE no cardboard. No tape. No registration tabs and no means to make them bc the hole punch doesn’t cut through any material. pic.twitter.com/v3ICkiBmUY. it looks like Blanca shows up this week!! IDK WHO HE IS AT ALL BUT PEOPLE SEEM TO DIG HIM SO I'M EXCITED. OHH THE PACKAGING DESIGN (both the illustrations and the shape of the container) IS REALLY RAD. LRT I KNEW IT GDI I WANTED SHORTERRRR. sNORT I showed my mom banana fish plush and she was like 
'two out of three look angry....only eiji's happy...well, /for now/....they should make his expression changeable' DSGDFHgh. The day I didn’t have yo be up early and theu have been cutting trees for four hours. WHAT THE HELL I thought they were taking down dead trees or trimming branches but nope they took down at least a dozen beautiful trees. humans are the worst. i wonder what they're gonna do in that space..probably something loud > n<. lrt modified plush makes me so happppyyy. Can you believe I don’t own a single pair of cat ears? 

Unfortunately I have no plans for tonight and couldn’t find my tiny witch hat so I just had fun w this @UchuuSummer  sweatshirt instead nya~ pic.twitter.com/2o3v2tbfZj. My dog’s butt is in the first pic.  thank. Shitpost pic.twitter.com/4sj3puqcmB. it's time to play: stay up and do the reading so I can attend my last class or go to bed and get another hour of sleep so i can attend my last class. At least I “finished” my tarot cards...will probably tweak after crit/before posting. IM LIKE 86% happy w how they came out but THEY WERE SO OVERWHELMING I think just bc i had to pick without getting to research first and even tho it turned into a week and a half it was one week for the four initially which was a lot for me. Screams i did the math and if I read every single free moment from now until class tonight I would probably just not quite finish the reading. Sometimes it’s not relevant to class but it looks like today is literally discussing it so I can’t..do that if I haven’t finished reading. It’s my fault for hanging out w joey last night when I knew I didn’t have time but it was Halloween.....orz if the tree people didn’t destroy my sleep I would’ve been ok..or if I did hw instead of screen printing on Tuesday...rip. Jennie Dwells on the Past and Guilts Herself Volume 6,452. me: Leaving you was the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do..
blanket burrito:   baby, come back. LRT omg it’s like ?? A warning? “Anime and manga may influence your style and THERES NO COMING BACK FROM THAT. WE’LL GO AHEAD AND PLAN THE FUNERal”. I usually leave at this time but I just crawled out of bed..it’s such a gray day but I gotta go zzzz. Two bowls of candy were stolen from my street last night! :( like the /bowls/...my neighbor is upset bc it was her good mixing bowl and I feel that. On my way to class I just saw the most relaxed looking guy just sauntering down the street and I wanna be him?? Sir how did you accomplish this level of chill?? Makes me wanna skip class and just walk about but I’m not gonna. “Juice is good. It’s like soda but not.” - overheard@school . Uh some guy started talking to me at the pizza place about how he worked w Seth Macfarlane and on the simpsons and family guy and stuff like

I couldn’t hear him well bc he did not adjust his speaking volume to fit the loud af place... IM V EXCITED FOR BANANA FISH TODAYYY
I can't watch it for several hours tho (yelling). One of my pins got pulled up on the first pull of the blue   Offset is charming in its own way but I’ll reregister and print another day pic.twitter.com/AuzoE3KvY3. mmmm i wanna know if i end up liking yut-lung or not. right now i'm like..he's..fine;......I MEAN HE KIDNAPPED EIJI LIKE TWICE and his interference led to shorter's death but also he's got his own problems idk time will tell (This is just a ramble don't spoil me please<3). LMFAOOO IM SORRY ANDYEET. IM GONNA WATCH BANANANANA FISH in a minute. UPDATE I WATCHED THIS WEEKS EPISODE AND IM NO LESS CONFUSED https:// twitter.com/cambrasine/sta tus/1058185122518917120   …. FAIR...after this week's ep I'm even more ???? than before but STILL EXCITED TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS. And Blanca too since people seem to like him??? lrt this was so soft. LMFAO THIS IS BEAUTIFUL YOU TWO. A..PREQUEL? oh man I have a lot more to learn about this series!! if i've learned anything this semester its that i can't paint a straight line to save my life
this was further exacerbated by today's assignment of a stripe painting. I THOUGHT I MATCHED THE COLORS PERFECTLY AT LEAST BUT MY PROF GAVE ME SHIT LIKE 'mmmm her dress is really more blue' BUT GUESS WHAT ITS NOT BRO BC ITS YELLOWED OVER TIME AND NOW ITS GRAYISH I put my brush next to the pic dude i can fake it but then you'll say it doens't marTFCHDF. ohhh i'd heard of the other two so maybe I'm not as out of the loop as I thought! Thank you so much for the info TT A TT 
yeah I'm gonna wait til I finish!!....I bought some more of the manga but I'm scared to read it lmfao. guys just a yes or no on this no spoilers but will i ever get to see sing and shorter hanging out like in a side story or flashback or smth. MMM My prof wanted me to take this class do u think she can overlook the THREE PREREQUISITES I’m missing   goodnight !! SNORT I’m looking up kids parties for some ideas for beddingng (next surface design project) and I’m crying who would do this pic.twitter.com/BIWSQEldPc. Imagine if the US government sued them like they’re Disney or smth . USPS is just the saddest place, in my experience everyone working there is so unhappy all the time and just looking at all that cardboard makes my hands dry  it seems like a somber theme to me LMFAO. Ohmygod ...happy birthday, Bobby, but we’ll see your ass in court. Omg imagine that..office party themed kids party . LRT I WANT THIS CHEERY DAIJOUBU BOY. i lowkey wanna enter this contest but what is time. i hope my prof lets me register for book otherwise idk what to take the offerings are really crappy this spring. I'M NOT CRYING YOU'RE CRYING GRTSDHGFHgf. My very modest goal for today was packages and at least one hour of reading so.../pats self on back 
Still a lot to do tho zzzz. pic.twitter.com/meeca7ohKW. lrt these are so gorgeous. seems like  a really good exercise too! my mom has this uchuu summer shirt i've wanted for a long time bc they had her size but not mine at ota and i'm HAPPY FOR HER BUT EVERY TIME SHE WEARS IT I AM OVERCOME WITH DESIRE ITS SO CUTE. i made sketches for two designs -sparkle emoji-. Yay! I got my@professors blessing so now I just need my advisor to not be a dick about it.
Like I get that they want me to graduate and waste my time and money on classes I have less than 0 interest in but dude I’m paying I should have free reign. Big banana fish mood. Yes. We can cry together abt not having tables. How many more days of shitty sleep until I’m so exhausted I sleep well. I just saw a family ride scooters on cobblestone. The clamps were loose so I lost 3 prints to them   Still one more layer just a lil shadow on the orange then I gotta ?? Bind???????????? pic.twitter.com/1r7acFnTYT.

She's such a sleepy dog it'll be a bit hard to tell but we'll definitely keep an eye on her...we've been checking her after our walks the past few days so I really don't know where this thing was.. we found it when adjusting the blanket she sleeps on..on the couch,...next to me (Screaming). i'm trying to research the life stage/gender/type of tick but ohmygod these photos are.. so gross. A BOP.. ITS SO CATCHY ANd i'm so weak for when visuals line up well w music... before the vet told us not to have the tick tested but there's never been one so engorged so we'll call tomorrow and see ...guhhh. LMFAOO ARE KIDS STILL WATCHING MIRACULOUS THAT WAS SO LAYERED. IT ENDED SO ABRUPTLY I FELT LIKE??? SDIGFDHGFDH ThiS TOOK ME A SECOND BUT ITS VERY GOOD ohmygod.

Gotta cut/style bangs obviously but out of the bag looks cute !!! pic.twitter.com/f0hLHCrMyb. @ grimmfirefly. My school is hosting a game w art as prizes so I submitted my online shop and they told me what they want and offered me less than my prices for it ($20-25 v $35) 
Lmfao like I’ll do it for my fellow students but damn I pay y’all so much $ every year just give me the $15. They’re adorable year round . Obviously being hopeful is better than being in despair but I wish I could better control my expectations,,,? Like in general I’m more pessimistic but somehow deep down I always get my hopes up more than I’d like and become disappointed  it’s hard to word... Thirdinf this. Just offer a discount. People will definitely want them. Just a musing based on getting an email from a waitlisted con asking for my portfolio again but prob just cause they lost it but galaxy brain is like THEY WILL LOOK AND LET U IN when that’s almost definitely not the case . I’m so fucking UGHHHH I have a headache from all the noise this guys been here since 7 and I’ve been up since before that and had 3 hours of sleep so I’m not functioning well enough to do anything but I also still can’t nap and Idk what to do. GOOD IT TOOK ME FIVE WHOLE MINUTES . Mom: ugh it signed me out of all my accounts 
Me: you must’ve hit sign out
Mom: no, I didn’t!
Me: did you clear your history?
Mom: Ohh... I was in private mode and cleared my history 
Me: if you were in private why would you—— mom what do you think private mode /does/
Mom: ..... my dumb ass has to get up early to vote bc i didn't early vote. me: what about this (common subject)
prof: what about this subtopic on that subject that's impossible to find more than the 1 article I sent u about
me: ..................what about----. i don't know how to write a research paper anymore is this what happens when you get your HISET then take only art major relevant courses for three years. my bro is back at school (grad school) writing his thesis and also TA'ing so this was the first time we could properly bond over our school suffering. ahah I appreciate it but I'm gonna power through (and probably bother my brother a bit haha)!! I'm not even to the paper part yet - just the proposal - but I have to pick a new topic bc she proposed one for me that I can't find enough about to write anything substantial. shoutout to myself for doing this before wednesday night so I was able to pick  a good time slot aaa. even tho he's not my best boy a lot of Shouto merch is super cute. I think it's that endearing clueless expression he has sometimes? . between daylight savings and sleeping from 3-6, 12-2 (with interruptions feat. Cadence, the delivery guy, and trash trucks) i'm??? so confused abt the time. no thanks https:// twitter.com/BostonGlobe/st atus/1059569057907859456   …. soft TT A TT. WHY IS ZENKAI AND QCK THE SAME DATES I HATE THIS. it's like -- there's few cons around here and it's so hard to get into cons and now these two overlap TT A TT Why this........... mind you this is also my bro's spring break so my family is pressuring me to go to OR the one weekend I may actually have smth /looks into camera. I THINK I NAMED HIM MARCEAU IN THE YEAR OF OUR LORD ...WHENEVER I WAS 14. but I just drew that ref a  couple months ago bc he deserves better. I hope my nose is just messed up from crying/usual swolleness/weird sleep and not that I’m finally succumbing to the cold that ravaged my school a few weeks back. I voted!! Now you! oh god now people are getting strep..please...just keep me in a bubble til anyc. Prof: it’s critical you vote
Student: yeah well .I’m busy on Tuesday’s sooooo
Me, seen pulling my hair out in the distance. “My education is important” I mean so are the lives of millions of people but ok. When I was little I LOVED Conan, but you had to be 16 to go to a taping so I was told we could go to NY when I was old enough. That was the year he moved to LA LMFAOO. so my mom saw last week that he was coming here and bought tix for tonight which is really nice of her but I’m so tired it’s still 3 more hours til it /starts/ zzzzzz. i'm sleep deprived still so i just drew a zebra. when I proposed carousel for my kids bedding project my teacher went /uGH/ and I was like OH NO SHES GONNA SAY 'babyish!' or 'overdone!' ---- then she went I /LOVE/ CAROUSELS
I also love carousels... very early wip!! ok time to screen print or research or smth that's not this bc priorities pic.twitter.com/ieZnNVWQa9. there's still time to vote, my west coast friends. ohmygod for art bingo my school is making me fill out a whole ass w-9 i m crying. CHECKING ELECTION RESULTS IS SO ADDICTING. gosh I just want Cruz to get beat so badly I--. bully them every time they complain about the results for the next two years (ʘ‿ʘ). It’s making me think about That Day two years ago.. . LRT GOOD JOB FLORIDA!! 
If you don't understand the big deal, watch this:  https://www. youtube.com/watch?v=NpPyLc Q2vdI   …. Why are we so close I’m gonna have a panic attack pic.twitter.com/OlqFrlWrhU. damn I leave y’all alone for two hours and you keep Ted Cruz in office? (I’m sorry, friends..). I hope they were fucking shook by how close it was, and those times in the night when he was pulling ahead. I think we should just take a moment to appreciate Paul Ryan no longer being speaker of the house. there's like 4 things i'm thinking of doing and 2 are low priority and 2 are high priority and guess which 2 i feel like doing sdFGJFDH. me: wow I should really get these four small new orders out immediately even tho I said I ship on Saturdays
research proposal: :|. I'm both glad and sad this is a universal experience. MMM no there'll always be something easier/more fun to do than that LMFAO I should..get it out of the way.. THIS IS SO FUN TO SCROLL UP AND DOWN BY! Optical illusion! LMFAOO MY MOMS MAD AT ME FOR PLAYING POP/STARS CAUSE IT WAS STUCK IN HER HEAD YESTERDAY I wasn’t even home  . these are so gorgeous but I have to say -- I like really /felt/ my eye being lead around the composition in the second one and it was Amazing!! update! Still early in the process..I haven't gotten my prof's feedback since sketch stage so hopefully she likes it LOL.....I don't particularly wanna start over. I think I may vary the poses, was just testing some color combos and types of 'horses' and stuff pic.twitter.com/Pfi0zstG3a. week-late, eagerly-anticipated AA e-mail: (arrives)
me: !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
e-mail: we're almost, done our bad, let u kno soon

I'M..I'm glad they let us know but i got excited bc i thought it was The Results. It just makes no sense to me to have to write an annotated bibliography before writing the damn paper like it says use three articles but what if I need more sources than three to write it???????? should I include them now or can I do so later? this is??????????? fdghfg THANK YOU...... I felt like that was the case but ..~anxiety~,... I haven't written a scientific paper like this since..uh..high school? so I'm feeling real out of my league rn .. I V MUCH APPRECIATE THE GUIDANCE <3. aa I think that's it but as usual I'm getting too worked up about it haha. Yeah, I think that's almost definitely the case here. I'm looking too deeply LMFAO. MY GOODNESS..That would have driven me crazy! I'm glad you were finally able to resolve it and best of luck with your packing!  ; u;. LOOK AT THEIR LIL CHEEK S*pinches*. ewagesg i can't believe even this little con that I previously (keyword: previously) felt fairly confident about getting into has had such an increase in applications too...artist alley is becoming such a nightmare...... omg. THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!.. IM ALSO FEELING THAT WAY SO I HOPE MY PROF DOESNT TEAR IT APART TOMORROW LMFAO
last class she said not to get married to an idea and I slammed down my sketcbook like BOOM, CAROUSEL *mic drop*. AAa wow! no no I think it's amazing that you can use it at all!! and have some success too!! I've never used it so I'm easy to impress here ahah. sorry i can't hear you over my mountain of kirishima plush. no but I totally get you..when someone I know/care about wants to get into it I think it's great but I also worry bc I know you have to constantly be learning and most people aren't super financially stable so it's really risky... 500?! JESUS
I had 100, and then an extra 60 replacement bc of their mistakes. They've done well enough to pay themselves off and it was an interesting (albeit somewhat painful) experience so no regrets but I'm honestly scared to count how many I have left. YEAH I can't stand seeing all these kickstarters for like 20 different designs of people who haven't made them before I'm like ARE U SURE BRO ?? I also feel like a lot of them are like..just make it a charm dude. Some designs just aren't *better* in enamel pin form yknow. LMFAOO I figure like 1000 years from now if I can't sell the last ones I can donate them??? There's a program that takes plush donations and gives them to kids in emergencies (like when they respond to 911 calls) but idk if they'll take them.. Obituary: Lani leaves behind (redacted) and 368 cat plush based on an anime character from several decades ago. YEAH like i know enamel pins are Hot but think about the medium!!!!! cause they may not be the best one for your design!! AND THATS AN EXPENSIVE MISTAKE. (cut to me in a rocking chair) 
me: Huh. I think I may have known this person...a long, long time ago...what a fool,...don't you agree?
(camera pans out to reveal I am talking to a large pile of my remaining Kirishima plush). fsdgfdhh THANK U FOR THE SUPPORT . pffft well at the very least it's probably good for your confidence?!?! I imagine it's nice!! Do you get a lot of people starting w lame/inappropriate pick up lines or no but it's just hard to keep it going in general? From my research (lmfao) it seemed like some people are down to meet up immediately w very little precursor while others want to chat more before deciding whether to meet. OHH I'm glad to hear it!!! Just a few pics and a couple lines can give you a solid impression of someone huh? AAA Thank you for your support!! So much good banana fish merch here!! *grabby hands* I need some of these for myself.. GHOST SMOOCHES...how is this so precious. Will you have these buttons at anime nyc perchance? :3 c. I swear to god I set my alarm for 7:30 so I could shower before they arrived at 8:15 and it’s fucking 7:20. YOO I HAD .. AFEELING THAT I THOUGHT WAS JUST SILLY HOPEFULNESS BUT UH SEE U BITCHES IN THE ANIME NYC ARTIST ALLEY IM SO ESXCITEDFG DGHGFH SHit. me: pulls up w like 5 rescue charms and 2 BF  polaroids IM NOT READY AND THERS NOT TIME TO ORDER. holy shit is this . ab ad idea??? ITS IN A WEEK.. IM so excited tho aaaa. THANK YOU... ITS SO SUDDEN IM FEELING REALLY UNPREPARED>..but I really wanted to do this con and I was gonna go attend one day anyways SO...omg. ngl i almost cried but omg i'm nauseous too I gotta go check on stock and stuff AAAA. just fyi - i just packed up the most recent orders last night so if you ordered already then you're good, but w things I'm low on are gonna be preorder from now on so I have some on hand for the con. will you be going? The name of one of the tables next to me is “softly gays” and idk who that is but I feel like we’ll get along. I haven’t read it yet and I’m SCARED. SMOLL ASH. AS OF 9:50 AM I AM. I'M OUT OF MY MOST POPULAR CHARMS AND THERES NO TIME TO REPLACE THEM WHATs UP LMFAOOO. any more ideas for carousel horsies? i have a zebra, unicorn, and pegasus. omg a good idea but i think all those legs may be a hard read haha. LMFAOO MY PROF IS PLAYING ONE OF MY FAVORITE SNL SKITS IN CLASS what is happening. IT WAS INTERESTING.............but oh god yeah too many leggies. OHH OKAPI ARE SO COOL I LOVE THEM!! Those are all v solid ideas i'l give them a go!! thank youuuu<3. overheard in the classroom: if i drew digitally i'd be done with this so quickly
me: looks into camera. How painful scale 1-10 is banana fish today ?? I think I heard it’s painful!!  then I’ll see you there !!! downloading today's episode..everyone says they're crying..i'm scared. *grabby hands*. LANI MAKE KAMINARI THEN PAIR THEM..MANGA READERS WILL REJOICE. I think people ship him w ojiro too..?? to be fair I still haven't made my bag.. I wanted to make it for anyc but i couldn't decide on a bag GURGfhfh. OHMYGOFDjgfhg ...................... THAT'S A WHOLE-ASS BANANA omg. . . it's really cute!!
I bought that Sing on a pin too bc I'm weak
I hope you had fun!! I like him but I have like three friends who love him so this was Shocking. omg yeah he's the most returned character in my gacha machine (if people do multiple turns I let them swap one out). SECOND MOST RETURNED IS OCHAKO, AND PEOPLE (unjustifiably) HATE OCHAKO--. but yeah it's true I always order way less of him lmfaoo. i'm a sad bean bc i ordered cute fan-made omanjuu but they haven't been shipped for months :( the person said they were shipping orders several times since then so i feel like its just me..and they haven't replied orz. ... I SEE WHY Y'ALL ARE CRYING.. I WAS FiNEN TIL THAT LAST SHOT OF HIM..HE LOOKS SO FUCKIN SAD I HATE THISdfgdfs. Out of curiosity, whereabouts are we in the manga? (Like, what volume is the point we're at rn in the anime) Will we get through the whole story in the next 6 episodes? #bananafish. I bought them from an artist via tictail. OOF. I wonder how they'll manage it...
Thank you so much for the answer! help. Yeah!! I think manga readers have seemed satisfied with the adaptation so far!! ; u;. thakns but no thanks i'm gonna eat a bite of cake then pass out face down in it. Stuff is all over bc of rennovations and my last Con was in uhh beginning of September? And it was a small one. I got my buttons, stickers, and tape sorted at least!! Charms? Those are a whole ‘nother story.. LRT I’ve wanted a cord wrap but I can’t choose which boy   I love how they’re cannon scenarios. There’s this really kinkshamey convo on the radio . They were like “I can’t be with a girl if she enjoys watching x y z type of porn” like bruh can u relax she’s not necessarily trying to do that/do it with/to you . I wanted to test the repeat pattern making method before diving into it with my current project, so I took a pattern that I made a fake repeat of a couple years ago and did it properly! It was a good exercise. pic.twitter.com/E3TGvigsTe. LMFAOO I MADE THE WHOLE PATTERN THEN REALIZED I ACCIDENTALLY MOVED ONE OF THE SADDLES HALF OFF THE HORSE PFF. YEAH!! YESTERDAY!!! I'll see you!! \o/ So many people I know are going it's gonna be Lit   and I'm gonna have to try hard not to spend every penny i make. casually gets 1000 miles ahead of myself. I actually reserved a hotel way back when and stubbornly didn't cancel it just in case (since you can cancel w 24 hrs notice) + I wanted to go for fun one day anyway!! ; u; Please do!! apologies in advance if i'm overwhelmed/sleep deprived but I'll do my best to be in good shape! how is it the 9th already. wasn't it just september??? i feel like I lost a /month/.. should probably use this for smth but who knows what. Prof: you have until the end of the semester for this project so take your time
Me: did u say go from concept to B grade versions of all 4 components in 4 days. There’s still rounds of critiques and changes to be made but I got kinda manic and made a really solid dent....I need to calm down and Not work on this til Tuesday now ajdndjdn. Plus I’m missing Thursday for nyc so. POTENTIAL FUTURE COLLAB IDEA HAS ME SO EXCITED again need to work on managing expectations..
brain: this probably won't be successful, don't get your hopes up
also my brain: OHHMYGOODODddd OHMYGOD THIS IS STHE BEST UFCKING IDEA ISEDGN THRSHEGvgdsfg. aaaa thank you friend TT A TT
oooohoho ~ I tried an older version of it on pouches once but it did just OK..these are superior tho. i mean to order new stickers like all the time then never do. FDJGIFDHFYGH YOU'RE..TOO KIND...But this class, as painful as its been, has been the first time I've really felt like 'hey..I could do this..(for a living)"  ..I'm gaining the skill but I don't have the discipline..it's definitely an interesting idea for the future tho TT A TT. ...this reply made me really happy tho thank you. I wish I could take advanced surface but it's at 8 AM and I'm already signed up for another 8 AM and that would be /two days in a row for months/ and I live an hour from school and am Not a morning person, as you may have gathered. my mom heard me talking and asked who I was talking to. She provided 3 very reasonable guesses of Humans I know but in the end I was asking my dog if she wanted to cuddle. I feel like banana fish is the sort of story where certain characters you strongly think are Good (Eiji) or Bad (Golzine) but most of the them you'll only know how to feel about them at the end (Yut-Lung, Blanca, etc.). LRT LITERALLY JUST TALKING ABOUT THIS TODAY and also in reference to today's exciting thing I want to do suddenly. i'm ready for bed but it's 7:15 please send help. u ever agree to hang w someone and then they get fucking SICK and yOU CANT GET SICK I CA?NT GET SICK I HAVE TO GO TO NY I---------. pretty boy. how can he hate ash when they're both pretty boys. i keep looking at the clock every 15 mintues hoping it has become late enough for me to go to sleep..getting there.. oh no there's finally a pita kirishima i want. never thought i'd hear the phrase 'be like bakugou,' and directed at me. I just woke up. It’s 5 AM. I suddenly want Arby’s really badly. Shoutout to my body - I usually wake up every night 3-5 hours in but I think I slept 7 just now...the end was restless a bit but oh well. Hnn my good friend lives in LA...I don’t know where exactly tho..I hope he’s ok. He hasn’t texted back.. Why the days I got no sleep did I feel fine but tired and now I tried to catch up and I have a headache. GUHH I REALLY WANNA SHARE THIS PATTERN W Y'ALL ALREADY BUT It's not Done done /rolls around
it'll probably be?????? weeks??? this project runs through like fucking december somethingth ... i'm so impattiennttt. LRT Even though this was posted three days ago the website is NOT updated!! Please tell your friends so they don't sit here refreshing all day like I was about to. LRT JESUS...Thankfully the table comes with badges! y'all if you want anything I didn't already mark as preorder to ship before like...next monday-wednesday, then please order by the end of the day! PLEASE SAVE ME A KIRI JENNY... /throws all my dollars@u
Also omg I love how smoll deku and aizawa look. i'm gonna try to work on another pattern when I have the chance! the prompt i didn't go w for the project. Me: Huh. This manu is in Fall River..
Mom: Oh yeah, Fall River is like the Lowell of the South Shore
Me: ????????????? ohh anime nyc is gonna have security dogs roaming around....good good working boys. i WANNA GO OUTSIDEEE but it's so windy all day i think i'll be blown away tbh. I hope anime nyc goes well bc 1. yknow, money (gotta pay for hotel, table, and puppy/bunny care - not even including stock) but 2. bc I have a lot of extra stock of certain things from having an okay ot*kon and a fairly bad fl*mecon and I'd love to just.clear out+start fresh(ish). THIS IS SO IMPORTANT I'm revisiting him since I have a con to go to---

Pretty soon I’m gonna have to change my account to nsfw bc of u. Uh what did I do to the keyboard pic.twitter.com/nmSKWP0cfx. Happy #PockyDay  #Pockyの日  everyone! 
I don't think I ever posted my final Pocky packaging designs sooooo --- tada!  pic.twitter.com/5badisq3Ur.  aaa thank you meru!! OHH that’d be pretty cute!! What a good idea!  Thank you so much! Lmfao@glico hire me . lrt.. i fucking loved..airbud... My mom accidentally stole smth today ("It blended in with the cart!") so thought I'd share the Two times in my life have I stolen. 1. Eyeshadow in Walgreens: I didn't have a basket or cart and I got tired of carrying it in my hand so I put it in my pocket and forgot about it. 2. A bottle of water at ..I think Walgreens again: I wish I had a better reason but I'd already drank almost all of it while roaming around the store and the line was... really, really long ...LMFAO

Ah, youth. LMFAOOO THIS IS AMAZING I love it. I think walgreens will survive my 1 accidental and 1 intentional but born completely from impatience incidents but I'd also feel bad if it were from a person or small biz or smth!! :P. mmm whaddya mean? like self checkout? it was before those days :o There was one cashier and - i remember it as 4,000 people so it was probably like 8-10 or smth haha. omg hahaha I bet every time she did it she got in the car and was like ".. SHIT" aha. ohhh my mom definitely did that once before! It's easy to forget down there. ahaha well, before it was more popular I guess.. I remember the cvs had just gotten them and they had devoted a whole person to making sure they ran right (they didn't) which seemed like.w.hat was the point haha. jesus ok. MM like at walmart they do but not at like grocery stores? they'll still come if you call for help but they're not like hovering over u like at walmart...depends on the place I guess. ahha omg reminds me when my mom was little her mom took her dress shopping some fancy place and accidentally walked out with a dress over her arm LMFAO...she told my mom she called them about it later and paid for it but she's Not Convinced. DFGHDFHH THANK U KRISPY <3 <3 <3. snORT CITRA... Why is this so true. aaa my hair is so soft...it was so gross before bc of the bathroom remodel and they had good water pressure and good shampoo (I brought my own but used theirs!) and softer water. Sure is amazing how I had restless sleep all night then the electrician comes and I start sleeping deeply for like 30 mins before he starts making noise . My kiribaku ass about to make kirimina merch . Anyway everyone can be friends always. Y e s like look this shit was so cute pic.twitter.com/f0bKs5NQJw. it’s kinda stupid so don’t get your hopes up   preview on my Instagram story... I’m a chocolate freak myself. eeep!! Thank you!! <3 <3 <3. he scares me but i like your drawings of them TT A TT. AAAA I  FEEL LIKE MY FRIEND AND I WERE JUST SAYING 'where's the fruits basket reboot' IM SO EXCITED. FRUITS BASKET REMAKE!!! FINALLY!.....now maybe i'll finally make the fruits basket merch i doodle once every three months and never go thru with. /...THEY DELAYED IT A SECOND TIME??? like 1. I hope everything's..ok...i do but 2. theres not like..someone else who can hit a launch button. YEAH. well i saw that maybe they hadn't replied to all the pro row applicants and they can't open reg apps until they do that so maybe that's it...but like since it's not fcfs they could just..apply that way too...then cross-reference the list before sending acceptances.. me: it's so hot in here! (turns down the heat)
me: /is instantly frozen in a block of ice. MMM I CANT DECIDE WHETHER TO MAKE THIS A STICKER OR CHARM. me: lani would like this
me: oh. y'all are so cute with your catalogues meanwhile i'm out here like here's everything i've made since i started aa 4 years ago *DUMPS*. (I didn't mean cute in a demeaning way I really meant it like wow catalogues are so cute). This is why I wanna sell out of stuff and start fresh !!  But it’s kind of a double-edged sword like “I want to be rid of this, I want to sell it—oh, I sold it..there’s a demand..I’ll make it again—-“. I just wish I..idk. had start up $ to make with no restraints, trying new types of products with everything from ethical and eco friendly sources...It’d be really cool!! To go to big shows evenly-spaced and manageable, sell online, do freelance on the side..That’s the dream atm. We were talking about ideal ego and ego ideal in yoga so it got me thinking abt this stuff. Tho I guess the point is to release the idea of what you *think* would make u happy LOL. Yesss! This is great! There’s a store kinda like this but “kawaii” focused - planet cute! I would also like to have a gift shop similar to artist alley but mostly original/unique but with general appeal ! Cause so many gift shops are so..ugh yknow ? Yeeesssss!! The first 10 mins of this class no one does anything it is so weird. I had anxiety dreams about being too late to line up for Colbert and then when I got up my mom told me we got moved to the priority group!! Rad. prof: make the mirrors bigger!
me: ok
----
prof: that mirror is too big now..make it smaller!
me: ok. LMFAO school admin person just sent me someone else's W9 -- address, social security#and all....... HSNDJDDN THATS SO SWEEt?!? I was literally gonna place last min print order tonight   do you have a price/stock list ? . MMM SOUNDS FAKE JESS I’m sure I can repay you somehow.. /slides u merch (but really if you want $ even just for the effort I’ll gladly pay ya!). con crunch (chomp). found two more banana fish charms!! bringing my grand total up to fucking FOUR lmfaoo welp. IM??? Going to bed ?? I have awoken https:// twitter.com/cambrasine/sta tus/1062528648505364480   …. Too bad it’s more like a nap bc my brain is such a bitch. Reminded for the millionth time I need to stop buying stuff on amazon u convenient little immoral bastard. Me: tries to go to bed early 
Brain: pic.twitter.com/MLtHLX0lr9. @ grimmfirefly. So Cady tested positive for Lyme causing bacteria today. Massachusetts, and our area in particular, are really high risk so the vet says it not that surprising even if we check her and use the collar and stuff. That said it’s inactive, she hasn’t exhibited Lyme Disease symptoms. So she’s on antibiotics for a month and just hope for the best ; n; Vet said it wasn’t necessarily from that gross tick we found - or even from this season - could be from any time. It says only 10% of Lyme positive dogs will develop clinical illness so that’s good..but fucking Labradors (she’s a mix) are susceptible to shit like arthritis and kidney issues :(. Tempted to glue it like this now pic.twitter.com/jqz4jdgRUF. Me too..The vet said she’s young and very healthy at least!  There’d be more cause for concern if she weren’t. HONEStly. WHAT THE FUCK IM SO JEALOUDUDDDNFNF   Take good care of the boys..they deserve it . Did u get them thru Aitai k*ji? LMFAOO I feel like an ass now whoops. Aaa  please do..  I’ve heard mixed things abt ak so I didn’t wanna order there, I only see 1 Ash on yahoo japan so far.. Ugh I’m so sorry...People who don’t take proper care of their pets are so frustrating..like damn it’s a Living Thing please pay attention svnsdj I hope she takes your pet to get medical attention soon.. or maybe you could call the vet yourself and leave a voicemail or smth and ask them to call her back to make an appt ? Oh shit I’m so sorry..that sounds bad..is she gonna be ok??? ... Really.7:30 start time and y’all come here 20 minutes early are u Mcfreaking kidding me. Nick these are Amazing. Do you / would you buy a phone case in artist alley? There’s a good deal but with so many models I’m... I think it’d be hard to like..buy to sell bc of all the different types. Rather do preorder but coupon is only good for a few days... DANI..dm me this place has lots of kinds and a sale for a few days. The fact that I never use phone cases is biting me in the ass Rn bc idk what type is best?? Hard shell?? Enamel?? Wtf is enamel?? Help. Yeah. Bummer I didn’t check my coupons sooner . friends..how much are phone cases in AA>.... I ca'nt find anyone selling them to get the standard. I have some (more) exciting plans for these patterns but meanwhile...PHONE CASES!

I went to lay down for a min and totally crashed for like 2-3 hours   my anyc stuff is still in a pile and not Packed. 28 days * 3 pills a day = a fuckton of pill pockets for Cady LOL

Pins by @circusbonez pic.twitter.com/Wd1QqLRag4. I ALMOST LOST TAMAKI but thankfully my friend noticed when he fell off   he is Safe. LMFAOO I probably embarrassed him. LRT I feel attacked. We’re gonna get snow...If my classes were cancelled on Tuesday...that’d be....amazing. Aaaaa congrats!!! DEEP DOPE I CANT BELIEVE. This weekend went well buy I think I sold like five enamel pins all weekend?! I even tried changing and moving the display around. Omg so weird? Maybe it just wasn’t a pin crowd?....I keep trying to get into this local show that I know they’d be popular at but they won’t let me in . Omg I saw all your fat gums were gone too. Any friendos/mutuals making charm or heart button orders soon? help me i can't remember -- on the last page of chapter 206 is the panel where deku's thinking abt Bakugou flashing back to smth important he said or is he just like 'kacchan' LOL. P MUCH.. I imagine it's especially true if you're alone, but even if I have someone with me theres always a Jennie-specific question asked as soon as I stuff my mouth w food LOL. The dog watcher ate all the pizza rolls, pizza bagels, and popcorn chicken :( THERE WERE WHOLE NEW BAGs..THAT IS 40 PIZZA ROLLS..ANd 8 SERVINGS OF POPCORN CHICKEN..WE WERE GONE FOR THREE DAYS DID HE *ONLY* EAT FREEZER FOOD DURING THAT TIME??? IS HE OK??? tfw a show u apply to extends their deadline.............does this mean my chances are good or that u hate what i submitted LMFAO. y'all are so cute!! ; u;. CAN U BELIEVE I LEFT MY TABLE YESTERDAY AND MISSED THE LITERAL BEST BOY
photo creds to my mom pic.twitter.com/ClT4gcQTTG. i'm seriously never going to get over this. It's even funnier bc it's such a like scrawny little dog i love him. I didn't even receive anything... > n<;;. WHAT THE ok I finally met the guy who watches the dog and he Does Exist (ITS BEEN SINCE APRIL) and he just texted my mom that it was nice to meet me and that he loved the 'my hero academia plush i had him ship before' (when I ran out between ACEN + Momo) and i'm fucking screaming. 'the last season that came out was awesome' SHOULD I BE PAYING HIM IN MERCH OR WHAT. can't believe my dog watcher is a weeb. dog walker: i hear they're making a movie! I wonder what it'll be about
me: oof, this is what call a "casual fan". i mean considering he said they're /making it/ as if it's still in production..LMFAO. funimation marketing team, get on it. I stopped at staples today so I didn’t have to stop before class tomorrow and I am ONE ENVELOPE SHORT (yells). I’m gonna do smth for Black Friday-Cyber Monday..idk what yet. Speech patterns are wild bc my prof wrote a story in which this guy dies and the place tries to cover it up and my brain automatically went “big yikes” ...which is not a super appropriate response. IM TRYING to take this movie for class seriously but the narrator feels condescending and all the footage is stock video and some are ridiculous. But now he just said “people always want to blame something outside themselves” while showing a BLM protest and I’m —-. LRT if I knew Korean I’d be on this lol. I’m excited to Bakugou and Tokage get into it, seems like they’re both rowdy little shits . LRT I read this somewhere before! Read if you wanna feel betrayed and bummed out abt square dancing in middle school. It's been a lil frustrating trying to get these cards to these shops as quickly as possible bc i feel like non-jews just assume chanukah happens at practically the same time as christmas and that's not always true - like, for example, THIS YEAR!! :P. at the same time maybe other non-jews will think the same thing, and they'll get and give them late to their jewish friends so maybe it'll all work out in the end lmfao. the LAST LINE..AND THE SM ILEY FACe..I'm fucking----
I'm ...I'm glad you know it's just bullshit bc of the timing but like...who does this.. Yay!! I’ll be at Zenkai again this year!! \o/ ..... pic.twitter.com/ok734XscK4. Pls entertain me while I sit in a parking lot. ILL ADMIT I HAD TO LOOK HIM UP but I love him...shaped like a friend. Aaa eevee and it’s evolutions we’re some of my favorites as a kid! . ACtual PHOtos OF ME CIRCA 2002 pic.twitter.com/qlur0UkPwM. @ DarksStars  see previous reply   ^^^^^. Aaa I love ponyta!! She’s a beauty! One I always liked to get in-game. I wasn’t a full-on horse girl, but I definitely was drawn to them u vu. Also I have to ask - why does Pikachu need a hat . ahahah fair! OhhMYgodgffhfdh this is gonna be the cutest shit.......... @ andythelemon_  are u seeing this. lrt what a good, spiteful boy LMFAO. lrt this is all i can think of abt hatsuharu. AC*N......pls email me LMFAOO THIS IS LIKE DAY THREE OR FOUR OF ROLLING ADMISSIONS.......i just wanna knowwww. Uh.....what the fuck am i looking at that's so high???? I need to place a charm order...do u want to...........get on that and not do this nonsense. OH - Stands.. I've gotten quotes for like $3-8 before.......... how do i delete someone else's tweet. LRT I am always amazed by how people will justify their bad behavior. LRT   beautiful girl. LRT Kirishima deserves 4th place don’t@me. Ugh the guy said he’d put in the toilet and shower head after they did the floor and shower walls which should be done today but now he’s saying paint and get the trim up first???   he def just doesn’t wanna work this week ..... screams my neighbor spent a lot of time and energy on this dinner invitation.....................it's like the whole invite is a joke but it's two pages long. idk how any bakugou fan can live without the new skull shirt nitotan. TT A TT I CANT BELIEVE GOT GOT KICKED OUT OF PLACE BY A NEWCOMER..................after dozens of chapters worth of investment. DFGDFHg I DIDNT KNOW THIS
/pats u Andy ily but i can't support this..you need to be realistic..stop living in a make-believe world----......imagine how expensive a coffin that would fit that many charms would contain, it's simply not practical. me: what a cozy day!! I'll go on a relaxing walk, pack some orders, and maybe draw for myself
me: (immediately starts obsessing over schoolwork). me: maybe i can get these for cheaper i'll wait to buy them
(later)
me: huh..they're more expensive...maybe I'll risk buying them at the original place then
original place: we upped our prices to even more than that!
me: HNNNNN. my mom is all sad bc the temple she went to through her childhood just got security guards....oh, america........... my mom's reading about this shelter dog that can't get a ride for the final leg of his trip to his forever home meanwhile cady is pawing at her bowl over and over again bc she wants more... dog entitlement srdgdHFGH. my prof p much told me i'm getting an A on this project yet here I fucking am. LRT horikoshi are u trying to tell me u picked up a fashion mag and saw crocs and thought Kirishima 
WHEN AND WHERE DID U FIND SUCH A THING. I made fun of Cady for staring at nothing like she often does but when we got close it turned out she was looking at this guy!! Sorry for the filter on the second photo, my cold fingers slipped lol pic.twitter.com/tVowrjPM1m. um my pokemon team picture is actually going well aside from the fact that this team is unbalanced, weak, and contains 7 pokemon. THIS WASNT ENTIRELY SARCASTIC BTW I LIKE HOW IT LOOKS SO FAR LOL. i just wanna draw ampharos all day long he looks so fuckin stupid i love him. i pronounced ampharos as amphar-OH-s instead of amphar-AH-s for the longest time btw i still don't know what's correct
All I can hear in my head is the N64 stadium announcer going "OH! IT'S CHAR-EEEE-ZARD" and i feel like I'll never be right about anything ever again. you know what's a weird trend i see a lot of japanese and korean artists do?
like the most beautiful drawings but then just a line of the plainest font you've ever seen
do y'all know what I'm talking about or is it just me?! LRT LITERALLY THIS MORNING I saw a cute kachakko drawing where they were in one shirt together and I was thinking of how bakugou could try to keep kiri warm w his turtleneck outfit LOL...but it's not the sort of thing that easily covers two people. i'm calling bullshit he definitely just wanted us to suffer. storenvy, which suxxxx... bigcartel if you're ok paying to have more than 5 products a month :| .......i've never tried shopify but maybe it's worth a go. OH SHIT really??? it's literally cheaper to have your own store then...my site i think the normal rate w the shop is like $16-19/mo. but if you just wait for a promo code then it's 50% off your first year 
 \o/. Etsy is..fine. I've had my most popular stuff taken down there and I just don't love the platform bc it's more overrun w crap than SE+tictail. @ pukaparade  seems to enjoy it and do well there tho :O. more than the fact that tictail won't even exist soon i can't get over the way they made the email 
"EXCITING NEWS" fucking is it??? or does it just suck for everyone who has a shop on your platform...at least...admit it and be like sorry guys bye.......?! Hi I took this off of facebook bc it's good. I'll put mine in the replies!! pic.twitter.com/yC1bl8mdLb. "who's a good boy" vs cady's face when we approach her with tweezers (For ticks and thorns) pic.twitter.com/h14kky7aFY. DFGDHY I LOVE HIM ,,, soft, warm-looking boi. my mom and i are just laying around accomplishing nothing ..we have 0 motivation and we dont know why...it feels like christmas or a friday night or smth /lays down. I would say cost/risk order goes like this from highest to lowest!!
doll-like > enamel pin > printed pouch > acrylic charm. (personally I think A would be most successful u vu ). omg that's what my mom says when everyone is driving dangerously . Yeah!! And there's screen printing on canvas pouches which would be more expensive I think but charming it fits your design, or if u wanna go less expensive/more colors then direct digital printing! Or oh I haven't made them myself but those 'leather'-y type ones are really cool! cady is finally cuddling w me..i'm so happy..the last few weeks she just goes over and hangs off my mom instead..maybe bc we had fun running around in the snow together today u vu. p sure it doesn't. I, at the time, thought I cleverly signed up for the 2nd time slot to present so that I wouldn't have to go 1st but wouldn't be worried about it through everyone else's presentations. Turns out there were a few extra slots so no one signed up for the one before mine. Now i'm 1st. I started watching this bc of all your tweets. I'm enjoying it!! I've watched through ep 4
I can't believe they had us think the guy was dead for like .5 seconds I was like "wow I really didn't expect a supernatural element........." LMfaOO. blocked . mood. fdgfdgh I laid in bed all day bc I could AKA the first day in weeks that there's been no con to get up for and no one doing loud-ass work in the house
I don't...wanna cook anything........../lays down. lrt that shit is so scary. The day this news broke - before the fucking MFA had apparently heard abt it - my mom got a sandwich there and the woman making it reached for the romaine and on a whim my mom was like actually you know what I'll have spinach instead. jesus christ my best friend in kindergarten just got engaged....am i getting old or. when I see good good rats i think of y'all @riibrego  @__jackary. yikes!! that's ok!! we'll take it at our own pace or not do those things or whatever 
it's just weird to think of people you knew so young as doing Adult things
ishsgsrdgtdh seriously tho I'M ONLY 22 TOO..my cousin got engaged before /prom/ what are the Youth up to these days. UNTIL THey......GET YA!!!

I know people experiencing different levels of thanksgiving woes, and you're all valid > A< I hope everyone can have a relaxing day tomorrow!! LMFAOO t his is a good one. you should publish a list of these for people to utilize this holiday season. i've been completely useless today.....I didn't help nearly at all w dinner..........and I even just sat doing literally nothing (not even on phone) then napped on the couch .....blegh. Mood w mob + tsuyu. LRT I was just like “his hair makes it so easy to throw him around”. Also can I just say Blanca changes his mind every five fucking seconds what is w this guy? “I came here to decline” “lol ok I’ll do it”
“I won’t kill only protect u” “fuck that” “yeah ok”. LMFAOO I THINK THATS JUST YOUR BRAIN FRIEND 
But....I agree. I REWATCHED FEW EPS OF FRUITS BASKET AND???

Nddjjdnddb fuck I’ve had a a migraine on and off since Thursday morning I toook medicine and slept a lot and ice pack and it still fucking hurts ughdhdhfh. Ahh, heat tends to make me dizzy/nauseous? Thank you for trying to help tho!! It finally went away, gah. Aaa thank you    it finally went away..hopefully for good lol. LRT but bakusquad . That fandom is a nightmare I’m glad I didn’t get involved w. Ugh I’m sorry..I hope it subsides soon
I just go crazy when it’s on and off or “not bad enough” to take meds so like three days of suffering later I finally take meds and it’s gone in an hour and I suffered out of stubbornness :| but then today meds didn’t do shit so that sucked. My TA emailed everyone suddenly today to have this thing done even tho the last email said by next Thursday   I’m done since I’m ahead but uh it was thanksgiving p sure 90% of the class did not do it yet. I have an é in my last name so I’ve always been a dick about this . omg .. we're so opposite!! 
Tylonel does literally nothing for me so I take NSAIDs and slowly destroy my fucking stomach lining..which is why I try to only take it when it's particularly bad
When I have a headache usually my head feels hotter than everything else so I ice!! at least we've found what works for us tho :O. LMFAOO sick of people mispronouncing my name and pokémon since 1996----. i s2g when something goes wrong w an order like I've run out or theres a delay and i have to send an email to someone I get so anxious and i'm like IM THE WORST HUMAN BEING and then they're always so fucking nice?? like 99.999999% of my customers are so kind to me????? so is AC*N just never emailing me or. lmfao u can tell i felt like shit earlier and feel ok now cause tweets have increase 10000%... I agree! The bright warm colors in the sunny ones are attractive but there's just something about the third one that feels really calm and comfortable. anyway if kyo doesn't wear a black crop top in the fruits basket reboot i'm calling the police. GUHHH I'm sorry TT A TT We are Doomed
I hAD JUST AN OK TIME THERE TOO that I was like 'hmm, would I come back here?' but I ...I WANT TO HAVE..THE OPTION. also I apologize - I didn't get the packages to the post office today bc I wasn't feeling well I stayed in bed til 9...pm........ I'll be sure to get them there so that they can be picked up ASAP on Monday!! Cleaning takes. So long. Me: how come the mess I spent months making can’t be cleaned up in an hour ? ok so my bro will lose things, then my mom finds them many months later. Just a week ago we were discussing how she found his keys + he was waiting on his belt (haha) + FUCKING TODAY SHE JUST WALKS IN HIS ROOM. ITS JUST SITTING THERE. ON THE FLOOR. 2 spiders scurry away from it? thank you ghost / spider / ??? friends ......now he will shut up about his belt . another day, another artist alley waitlist. he looked for that belt for so much time. things are so fucking weird sometimes. WAIT AC*N or K*waii ??? lol i could've just written kawaii. jk i didn't read it well enough yeah i was also Rejected I guess cause it doesn't say waitlist..WHICH IS A FUCKIN BUMMER bc last year I got off the waitlist but I was like uh yeah I can't really just fucking go to hawaii w a week's notice it takes me that long to get there LMFAO. か*いいkon. ***い***. lmfaoo i mean I feel like it's not as unreasonable for the continental US -- still very last minute but..I think it's weird when cons ask for your home address but this is a good example of a time that would be useful. me: tsurune comes out on sundays
friend: crying abt tsurune
me: oh it must be out saturdays instead

seriously u give me one (1) unstructured week and I literally don't know what day it is. LMFAO YEAh...I ALMOST TAGGED U but I  was like am i really about to tag andy in every tsurune related tweet I make. ALSO I DOWNLOADED tODAYS EP BUT HAVENT WATCH IT YET SOOOOO. andy: is this tweet about me

Last day!! https:// twitter.com/cambrasine/sta tus/1065701172252762112   ….

I have like 7000 things on my to do list for today??

I'm so used to things being out of place..I've been freezing my but off for a while bc I couldn't find the remote for the heat + when I vocalized this to my mom she burst out laughing bc instead of being on a table or couch-- it's in its holder on the wall like it should be. lrt REMEMBER KIDS VIOLENCE ISNT THE ANSWER But also that's really cute and i'm 100% on board. (working on my banana fish zine piece)

Yeah bc it meant staying in bed for 30 more seconds . sometimes this class starts right away and sometimes it starts 15 whole minutes later and dang i could've gotten food. I just had a small stroke bc I thought I got on the wrong train
(It’s fine tho I just got disoriented). When I’m sick he’s always there to entertain me . This AMV was one of my favorites when I was younger. Of course it’s cringey but this song is still a bop. Please enjoy.

Seriously..during my break from school I fell asleep right away, got 8-10 hours every night and didn’t wake up 4-5 hours in. as of last night I’m back to unable to fall asleep for 1-2 hours +  waking up 4-5 hours later and feeling restless . Why this?? Now it’s clearly mental .. How the fuck do I fix this. Dratini u vu. Christmas trees we have had:
> Mirrored trees

someone in Anime Boston social just asked what a terminal change is,. meanwhile a guy in an art group posted a wip where the character's breasts are grotesquely large - 2.5 of her heads each, + when ppl reacted as you'd imagine (laughter, outrage, etc.), he wrote that clearly none of them can appreciate the human body or have drawn nude models i'm. RIGHt...HE's...SO OFF-BASE..........can i show u the drawing i feel like it'll add to your experience. whoops i dm'd to your other accountdesgdfg sorry. oh, she is straddling a giant carrot entirely naked. It sure is a fun detail. Tomorrow sounds bad no thanks. Don’t be embarrassed!! You worked hard!! I’m sure it’s great!! .

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA. @RedRiotVEVO your icon. i'mc rying. blocked. un followed. DSFASDHFGH LAO DONT FUCK THIS UP

(it's already fucked up). NEVEERRRRR. this will haunt me in my dreams tonight. .....The rationalization of art thiefs and reposters is always a fucking ride. I had a dream where I was being relentlessly attacked by this boy who liked me who I rejected over and over again in grade school, who had transformed into a possum. It sounds ridiculous but I woke up whimpering. I threw him out of the house but he found his way back in. I tried to feed him to a mountain lion but he outsmarted it. I tried to drown him but he clung to the top. He always came back to attack me.. Ok I’ll shut up abt the new chapter beyond this:
BAKUGOU WAS SO COOL 
AND KIRI WAS PROUD HA. In other news I thought maybe it’d go away overnight but one of my tear ducts really fucking hurts ?? My eye??? Ow??? Why?? Uhhhhh I think my tear duct is blocked and it hurts.

Wow I hadn’t heard of Anderson Paak but I really dug it - The music and the artistic performance :o. Amazing how much the meaning and mood shifts based just on the lighting :O WOW! OHH!! I’m digging it! I’m gonna look into it soon! Any favorite songs? :). Cause of death: this comic . There’s so much to do today but I slept til 12 and laid in bed til 2. my experience trying to get the banana fish furyu plush so far:

I just met the man of my dreams at Home Goods pic.twitter.com/0E2hTPfarC. I’m so happy to have met him..even if we can’t live together. I wish   I didn’t even look at the price tag. I have so much stuff already idk if there’s even enough square feet for this lil cutie . I'm glad you appreciate it, I spent a good 45 seconds looking for it . WHO'S THAT POKÉMON? Happy first night of Chanukkah friends!! . delete this . more guys should wear nail polish and eyeliner if they want cause lets be honest that shit looks good on everyone: confirmed. aaa i'm after different plushes but I can relate to like UNFORESEEN GIANT INCREASES FROM STARTING BID...yahoo auctions in the worst too bc it just keeps extending forever!! ; n; I hope you can get yours soon!!! <3. oh! our results are pretty similar!! pic.twitter.com/jkc3wj62zv. this is so soft (literally). websites where I somehow have to reset my password every time:

MY FUCKING SCHOOL------. lrt i fucking love..sara kipin...and crona... I LITERALLY GOT A CHILL. i keep calling mi-NA-TO mi-KA-DO DRSGTDH WHY DO THEY LOOK SO SIMILAR WHO DID THIS. FGJHJGjjh 
I FEEL LIKE//.COMPARING THEM LIKE THAT IS UNFAIR TO MINATO....THE...THE DISASTER SCALE..THEYRE NOT AT THE SAME POINT ON IT. fun fact abt me I used to have a nsfw blog on tumblr...rest in pieces. I... I understand it was causing issues w the app thing but like.................i can't get over this?? no more female nipples even wtf like that's not always in a sexual context u assholessdfghjkl going backwards over here. essentially they're being positive about/respecting trans people with the term 'presenting', but the overall statement that 'female presenting nipples are banned,' treats all females (cis and trans) as second class. bc male nipples aren't banned but all female nipples are. yeah...just watching them destroying everything throughout the years has been An Experience. Aaa I've heard of pillowfort but don't think I've ever been on there? :O but yeah..  Thank you so much !! I’m glad they arrived safely! (Looks into camera) my charm supplier just told me they’d make my order faster if I ordered more charms?!   so if anyone needs anything HMU real quick ... shsndjdns this is what happens when your supplier gets popular..it was smaller than my usual orders but still  $ xxx. Uhh roughly 250 maybe I’m too lazy to math. I’m dead. How’s the place we get the other stuff been? Maybe a bit more. Yeah. She just said if I wanted it faster bc they’re busy :|. 1:30 AM
Someone who cares about their wellbeing: going to sleep
me: ripping apart shitty mass produced home goods art for the frame. THEY GLUED THE MAT DOWN i'm fjdsefiegtfdh. now i have to make a mat...if i even have stuff for one sdgfdgh i'm cryin. Casually falls back asleep after alarm like a sleep deprived dumbass. I had a dream where I was planning my grandma’s funeral so my brain was like it’s ok to miss class just tell them what happened then I finally woke up and realized that was 2 years ago and was like FUCK lmfao. THIS IS SO CRYPTIC I H8 LMFAOO. Ohhh noo i forgot to get up for the auction...I WILL GET YOU ONE OF THESE DAYS, ASH. As if I don’t already know this . BUYEE IS SO CONFUSING DID I GET THE THING ORNOT I can't tell. help ii'm fucking confused
the bid and buyout price were the same and i clicked win for buyout and submitted but it's acting like i made a bid i'm. sobbing i just like. do not understand. it's like your bid has been placed... i tried to...buy it now.. i hit buy it now. it happened on the other listing just now too TT A TT I need to know if it's for sure or not orz. WAIT NO it's moving over it's just super delayed but omg it says thank u for your bid and the time left before it processes /sigh 
tHANK YOU FOR TRYING TO HELP ME THO <3 <3 <3. Just spent an unprecedented amount on plush bc of auction circumstances but I’m gonna resell an eiji and two yut-lungs lol. <3. was...someone seriously giving you a hard time about this? I had ordered a giant batch a long time ago so I finally just ran out and got eco friendly ones! I'd recommend  https://www. ecoenclose.com /    they offer free samples too! They have kraft mailers, but if you like the poly ones like I do for the water protection then they have some that are: made partly of recycled materials, re-usable (2nd seal), and are recyclable themselves! .... I FORGOT U WEREN'T THAT OLD ALREADY?..........maybe bc drinking/clubbing age is 21 here. hey someone make a fruits basket zine and invite me
thanks in  advance. aaa thank you noni!!! I also..really wanted to make a calendar,..but it's way too late for this year lmfao. i finished rewatching fruits basket again a few days ago and lmfao it's just like..the last few episodes are total tonal whiplash it's so funny .............. I know i've said it 1000x but i'm really looking forward to the reboot! I don't think I read the whole manga before but I know they also cut out some characters/relationships so I really hope it is the 'full story' this time!! yeah it's.....IT'S NO GOOD LMFAOO 
So I'm really looking forward to the new one!! I feel like they'll handle it much better this time!! also I remember baby!me loved Kyo way more, but now that I'm older I like Yuki a lot more this time around -- more than I liked him before I mean - not more than I like Kyo...tbh now I really don't know who my best boy is. ITs WAY WORSE THAN I REMEMbeR. Like everything - animation, voice acting, pacing, etc. It's..it's all bad. I love it still and I still enjoyed the rewatch and will enjoy having it fresher in my mind as a comparison when the new one comes out. I'm not sure what the case was - you could very well be right - all I do know is they hecked up..the last 3 eps are just completely different ..like kyo barely appears for several episodes then suddenly it's all about him and gets super dark w no fluff/humor. Here's the only surviving fruits basket fan art I made back in the day
circa 2008
you're welcome / i'm sorry pic.twitter.com/cIGGwRiTUm. based on @horikoshiko  's illustration

.. what, was i gonna *not* do it??? pic.twitter.com/4gCZF8yy2Q. i did this w my trackpad, b gentle. Omg I thought abt it but I thought no one would want it . Ahahah maybe stickers or smth... AHSHDJD THANK U CITRA . Omg I can’t believe smth I drew in 15 min w my trackpad is getting attention I need to draw stupid shit more often...THANK YOU THO   I think I may make stickers.... My final project for Surface Design! Since I was ahead I made an extra accessory~  

I worked really hard on this and I'm pretty in love with how it came out! Even though it's not a real kid's bedding set, I have some ideas in store for this pattern so please look forward to it~ pic.twitter.com/g0BTxpYSmp. I also made some adjustments to the pattern since making this, but here are some alternate colorways! pic.twitter.com/qP09U87ADl. We got a free choice project at the end bc there's still a few classes left. I didn't have any ideas, so I decided to follow my other pattern idea which was lemonade stand!!  
It's not as clear in my mind as the carousel one was so I'm excited to see where it goes :o pic.twitter.com/iliW5HkMp2. Sounds like a proposal. Aahdbsjhs   THANK YOU!! Yes!! We do! It was mostly just assignments and being super overstimulated lmfao But I really enjoyed it and made a lot of good stuff I wouldn’t have otherwise!! I wanted to do the follow up course but the timing was bad. Yeah!! Making a repeat pattern is actually p easy! Well, making it GOOD isn’t but the process of making it is haha essentially just arrange, cut in half one way and switch the place of the two pieces, then cut in half the other way and switch the place of those pieces and voila. I used the same joke twice tonight w different audiences and both laughed . Hey y’all it’s finals ish and prepping the house for my bro’s return so I fell behind on messages/emails. I plan to play catch up and mail existing in stock orders tomorrow. AAAA IFORGOT IT WAS BANANA FISH DAY
I saw a screen cap- it wasn't anything spoiler-y but the text was 'and here is how you say goodbye' and the implications are killing me
like I don't know what happens but
I think I know what happens
DFSGJOGFHHH IM SO STRESSED IN CLASS NOW LOL. AEGRESH OH NO I SAW ANOTHER SPOILER AND I QUIETLY WENT "UUUAHh" luckily class hasn't started yet but ouch oh my god ok i gotta get off fucking twitter I don't usually see so many spoilers oh god gfodsgth MY STOMACH IS TURNING this show is so pain. I came 5 min late and only three people were here  it's been almost 20 mins of class.  and we're still missing a few people. I could've...watch nana fish LOL. PETTY TWEET this girl in my class instead of 'um' goes 'UOOHHMMm' and idk why it drives me slightly insane. good luck!! . I think it's just the summer version? :O. LRT WHAT THE FUCK IT LOOOKS SO GOOD IT LOOKS WAY WAY BETTER HOLY SHITTtt i'm so fucking HYPED. LMFaoo this guy didnt talk to this girl literally all semester but SUDDENLY today he's been chatting her up and just asked what she's doing this weekend. I just ran to class thinking I was late but I’m > 10 minutes over I’m.
Oh, the end of the semestwe. Soon to be on a gallery wall! P rad!!
.

.
Well, more like a pseudo-gallery? Haha pic.twitter.com/zd7IGJ1YLB. Screen print with neon inks!! The orange, yellow, pink (gradient over orange) and lighter blue glow under black light . temporarily stranded so time to watch banana fish and cry in a public place??? can I just say I'm very impressed w myself bc the moment that guy dropped the lit cigarette I was like OH!!! DO THE THING (he did). ok i finished todays episode . can someone delete this series, thanks. on top of the Obvious Distress i'm fuckin worried about Max too..ily.............b OK. Also Blanca..good job,...yut-lung I’ll ...never understand u. a woman in my class gave a presentation on instinct, intuition, and intellect (arguably not yoga?) and somehow her examples covered heterosexuality, veganism, and 9/11. lrt ohhh yuki's hair is actually silver now! When I was rewatching one of the fan club girls was like 'his silver hair~~~' and i was like UHHHHHH what? bc it looks..purple-gray???dark????????? 

also tohru's eyes are brown again! lmfao. lrt (again) but ...THey're...very pretty..which is nice but I feel like they really lost the style? I mean it's a whole new take so it's whatever, but I miss the rougher look!! especially kyo!!! he looks like a model lmfaooo. i tweeted a lot today...sorry. stOP. idk how i'm gonna deal w watching in japanese / new english dub bc I always watched in english before....i can't imagine anything but (whispers) Miss Honda... from Yuki...he practically whispers like 90% of his dialogue in the show it'll be hard to have smth different lmfao. when he was yelling@kyo in the last or second to last episode i was like holy shit is this what he sounds like he's speaking at a reasonable volume??? my prof wanted me to add dogs to my pattern but they just look so irrelevant??? I put a lemon in its mouth and she told me to remove it so now it's just?????? completely unrelated? just a bunch of lemonade stuff and then a dog??????????idon'tliekrthdg. IDK DUDE IM?????????? I LOVE DOGS, HE'S A G OOD BOY BUT>??????
she was like 'it looks like he's holding a banana' and i'm like HOW,,, ALL THE CONTEXT Is...LEMONS????  pic.twitter.com/6KnlOyQgcR. idk but i want a good grade :|
i'm just;;; so tired; is this over yet...the last project was supposed to be the final one......../lays down. SMORT
THANK YOU. I'M GLAD but omg i'm really tweeting a lot today? usually on thursdays i'm so dead that i just disappear for 12 hours haha. I think it's just bc it lost like..all sense of individuality :( I know they're redoing many aspects of it but it feels like the style is pretty generic.. i should. guys i'm gonna have closet doors!!! we moved in here sept 2017!!!! IM SO HAPPY TO HAVE...CLOSET DOORs....even if they're not painted yet.. i chew my hair sometimes when i'm trying to rush while drawing so sometimes I do this in class but there's some defense mechanism in my brain that when I feel my prof looking in my direction in my peripheral I open my mouth and drop it like a dog lmfao. I redrew this but I didn't have my phone so I couldn't remember what the original drawing or kyo looked like but it's still cute...angry kitty!! pic.twitter.com/KAydqlIWk0. me: PACKAGE DAY LORD HELP ME
orders: (only 3 that don't involve a preorder item)
me: oh. ha ha who wants to help lil old me?
what could this pattern be applied to? It doesn't matter if it's not realistic for production - it's just for class. https:// twitter.com/cambrasine/sta tus/1070439741701742593   …. OHhh a backpack would be cute!! My mom suggested apron too!! :O Thank you!! <3 <3 <3. OHH THATS CUTE TOO
THANK YOU!! . this made me think like lemon cough drops
LOOK KIDS THE PACKAGING IS CUTE SO DONT THINK ABOUT THE TASTE--. lrt I'm not saying i designed adrien's ladybug outfit but the arm things are totally the same and i'm smug af

I really wanna redraw this beetle boy now lmfao. it's amazing how many things are starting drawing and forgot about completely...ladybird fan art, sanrio danshi chibis...a cinamon bun..baby izuku with inko... it seems like I was really struggling last year :(. aaa bakugou and deku being proper rivals now makes me so happy!! ngl I was smiling while I read that part, even if bakugou was still crude as usual lmfao i love how it said "REFLEX"! of course not everything changed instantly, that wouldn't be realistic!! Aaa thank you for your support!! I’m glad it arrived safely!! What a good haul here . Course evaluations: done!
Research paper: *crickets*. what the fuck this is so cute. I wanna wear these somewhere right the heck now @grimmfirefly pic.twitter.com/bnf9HNsIFm.  I’m sorry friend, I know that feel...I have this cute rabbit patterned top that’s too small.. They’re really dropping the ball lately. Lmfao we finally put all the furniture back in it’s rightful place and Cady just keeps popping up everywhere. Yeah. I’m bummed out. I know another place if u want but I haven’t tried them myself for charms. They have some cool materials but I think you need to order a lotish, and I don’t think they do foil and stuff sigh. Same w another rep there for nearly three years now :( but like. The past four times she’s asked for my address..and this time she said I’d have to order more to get it faster...I don’t feel super appreciated lmfao. WOW!! It turned out amazing!! Super cool! Some doodles of my classmates while they gave presentations yesterday (I was feeling antsy) pic.twitter.com/jSeFFBoF6M. Aaand some fruits basket profile doodles, w/o reference bc I was in class pic.twitter.com/WtdZsxKGsf. THIS IS GORGEOUS! i've been cold all day but a hot shower seems stupid bc i've also been cleaning (aka sweat, dust, etc.)  and need to continue cleaning. These candles have been melting so bizarrely pic.twitter.com/eYsyHqHtxI. OhHMYGOd. If you romantacize romance please unfollow~. Me during finals. Ps our channukiah is shaped like the word Chanukah which is cheesy so this is my grandma’s! Isn’t it beautiful? my mom let stuff accumulate..for so many years...+ now so much of my grandma's stuff...my uncle threw a ton of stuff out back then but my mom took like all the linens, pillows, etc. so we could donate+recycle them but they sat for 2 years til now. there's so much STUFFa nightmare. LRTs I literally was following this artist and then i saw this on my TL and twitter said i wasn't :|. someone had a costco membership . the water pressure is good now after months of sometimes trickling water (i'm not joking sometimes i'd turn on the faucet to literally nothing) but now it feels like SO MUCH water that I feel guilty/wasteful taking long showers = n=. AS FAR AS I'M AWARE, I only have two Kiri plush w/ nipple+bellybutton embroidery left! I have lots of bare-chested ones still~ 
Both are on sale right now at  http:// cambrasine.art/shop-all    , so give a boy a home for the holidays u vu pic.twitter.com/slLIP9pTbs. scREAM I got 30 spam contacts within minutes so I marked those are spam but now all my storenvy messages are going to spam ... oh, storenvy... omg i've taken time out to cuddle w her but cady is anxious bc of all the stuff we're moving around cleaning, bc usually it's us packing for a con and leaving :( she just barked at a /zipper/. it was 6:00 and now it's 11:00 i'm so confused. I hope my brother knows I love him bc I skipped a one-day holiday fair and seeing into the spiderverse early to clean this fucking house for him. fdsjfg i thought if you're moving your blood should be circulating a lot but i've been moving all day and my hands are blocks of ice still. Assumed crumpled paper in my pocket was for recycling but it was money goodnight all. LRT tw body horror. Uh I used the same shampoo and conditioner as the last several times but I really massaged it in so I could enjoy the hot water and...my hair is??? So soft???? . WTF RIGHT ITS SO Nice?? I didn’t realize it would make such a difference :O. It’s also?? I slept on it which I Hate to do but it’s . Totally fine and not frizzy or weird at all. It’s unusually smooth. I put it in a bun hoping for waves and it’s so smol. @ grimmfirefly. me: ok I'm ready! to! go!!
mom: ok-
me: (immediately walks into something, yelling in surprise, resulting in a large crash)
mom: .....  Hey y'all!  
I'll be ordering some new sticker sheets!
They're elements from patterns I've been making for Surface Design
You can get them@ http:// cambrasine.art/shop-all     pic.twitter.com/ip9wJ71cCJ. LMFAOOOO honestly i haven't shown her this since thursday so for all I know I could go in this week and she could say draw a duck and i'd ducking do it for an A. the animals run the lemonade stand they are raising money to campaign for the 2020 election bc the human race has failed. Back in Oregon my bros roommate has a puppy who’s in that rebellious teenage stage so he came home and is being strict w Cady :( She was so happy to see him too. lmfaoo my brother is laughing cause somehow cady knows the command 'toot toot' which is move ya butt. lrt this is like the happiest paul rudd i've seen omg. me, definitely fine, writing an entire final paper in one day bc i spent 3 full days cleaning the house, have class tomorrow, have people coming over which apparently means another half day of cleaning and half day of entertaining them, and then it's DUE. lmfao i haven't written a research paper in forever and this is just like so jam packed w info that I was like WOW MAKING PROGRESS and i have like 2 pages i'mc rying. Will do!!! my brother, a scientist, offered to help me with my paper which would be nice if he wasn't on my ass about every little thing. Like I want my paper to be good but his pickiness and strictness is..not what I need....it's..yoga' class...please ....i'm an art major..i'm. ok i'm gonna hand him my first draft fucking pray for me. I hate when BakuDeku overtakes BakuKiri in#of fics on archive of our own not bc I’m an anti or ship wars or anything, but bc then the placement of them in the list switches I acidentally check the wrong box. Sigh my prof said he’d be late but there for the majority of class and there’d be a new assignment but now he not come at all, there’s no new assignment, and I’m here, salty bc I could’ve been hanging w my family or on a walk in the woods bsbdbd. Thank u. I told my bro I didn't like the "R. G." of my initials in my title page and he changed it to "R G" and then "O G" lmfaoo. sdfgdht there's a japanese imports store at my school which is bad for my health

RIGHT?............./sob. dfdgfhd hthank u for the validation friend
but in the end I'll change it for her if its the difference between a B and an A lmfao ...orz. yeah!! I thought she was gonna say 'slap for kids on there' to which I would've been 100% receptive but she was like WHY DONT U MAKE UP YOUR OWN ...naming is my least favorite part of anything

prof: im gonna try to make a special spot for you in advanced surface design
me: shit. Big Mood Andy TT A TT <3 I did it last year but I know I missed a few people so I def didn't wanna take it on again knowing i'd be even busier!! there's always next year. I didn't watch nana fish on my phone either bc I decided why was I gonna get myself even more stressed/cry when I was already tense and freaking about this presentation?
so I'll watch tomorrow night and try to avoid spoilers...second to last episode, right? I’m tired but I saw #IntoTheSpiderVerse  and it was amazing as I hyped it up to be in my head. I worked hard this semester...this is my reward to myself pic.twitter.com/pZfIpSWoZo. Today’s outfit ended up with a theme 
..there’s 7 eyes total...9 if you count mine  pic.twitter.com/aNdIFAIcdt. There’s no way I’m not seeing Spider-Man a second time aaa. It’s so visually stimulating there’s no way you can take it all in on one run. OHHHH!! YOU GOT THEM!!! <3 I haven't arranged for mine to be shipped to me yet cause in case i slip and buy all the BNHA Jump Festa stuff rsegjrtdh. uh ok we have 100000000 build-a-bears to donate and this website is like 'we can only accept gender-neutral bears as we don't know how many boys or girls will be receiving them' 
.......THEYRE FUCKIN BEARS,,,, BRO. YOU CANT GIVE A BEAR THATS PINK OR WEARING A SKIRT TO A BOY?? OR A GIRL CANT POSSIBLY LOVE A BEAR THATS WEARING A TIE OR SMTH? HOW DO THEY NOT REALIZE HOW RIDICULOUS THAT IS. I CANNOT EVEN IMAGINE THIS. "Very gay show. It's good." - actual quote from my mom during the ED of this week's Tsurune. me@your carpet: who hurt you.. :( Luckily there's other places that accept these donations but...sigh......... one of these days i have to sort through all the stuffed animals that are in a big container under my bed..i'm so scared.. lrt i've used this method before!! But mind you theres no texture or variation in line weight. @ andythelemon_. oh my god there's a shelter dog transfer that says 'overnight leg' ...imagine if i had three dogs for one night.................. .....WE'RE GONNA ASK MY BRO IF HES DOWN LMFAO WHY WONT HE ANSwe.rRR. hnn kinda like cady...her spot on the couch is full of hair lmfao. Omg. I feel like I don’t understand Shuu or Seiya well orz. M...ur..der... .My brother decided to rearrange the art room so he could do yoga so now I can't find anything and he destroyed my order packing section . i've been putting off watching this weeks banana LOL. ITS NOT HE'S 4 YEARS OLDER,, IT'S A CLEAN FREAK MOVE. He said it's not relaxing still bc there's so much stuff around the space he made so...WHY DID HE DO THE THING I'm --. Also monomas line this week made me literally go OHHHHHHHHHHHHHhhhh aloud
I CANT STAND HIM. LRT ...such gorgeous execution .. please go look at the thumbnails/light studies posted a little while ago too. LRT aaaa I read about this before :( like they used to think that flipping a rabbit on its back was relaxing it but turns out you’re fucking crazy stressing them out and I think they can literally die from stress so..don’t do. LMFAOOO i wish, it'll just be my fault for not cleaning the whole room . Reese’s are best in what form? Reese’s sticks are my ultimate favorite candy and it sucks bc they don’t have them everywhere bc they aren’t as popular   I had joey try it last night and he wasn’t impressed.. Everything you love about a KitKat, but fucking PeANut BUttEr. How dare u compare my son to that monstrosity pic.twitter.com/gOrNjNS1Vx. I think the reason why I like the sticks best is bc I love peanut butter but in a smaller amount relative to the rest of the thing... Me: I’m almost done w the semester! It’ll feel so freeing 
Me: (casually slips into a depressive state where I lay in bed til 2 pm). Ohh!! You should try them if you like KitKats . THEY ARE SO UNDERRATED IMO ..you gotta look for them. They’re more at like convenience stores. True. It’s a damn mess. I feel like I’ve shut off and gone into power save mode and that’s not ideal. I think so..I like a good amount of time alone but with my brother home that's not really an option. He was on my butt about cleaning, so today I was cleaning but then he was like jenn you should be in the kitchen with us right now, be social!  cannot win.... lmfao. lemme know how ya like it!! ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. HNN I HOPE MY CHARMS ARRIVE IN TIME TO MAIL FOR CHRISTMAS................ fgsdg I'm going through plush to donate and it's hard bc i gotta stop to check the collectible ones just in case but most of them aren't valuable so it's like..i'd rather a kid in needs gets it have this rather than me have $10. WHATS HARDER IS THE NEOPETS PLUSH....i'm attached. holy shit that's amazing progress though!  i just found at least a few dozen i'm so scared..at least most are mcdonalds size. SHIT I JUST FOUND MORE BIG ONES PLS END ME. Hnn in the end I didn’t get rid of a lot of plush :( The problem is I only went through the ones I keep in my room — which are longstanding favorites..the rest are prob in the cursed storage  unit . MMM I made brownies for my family + my classmates but if we're being honest idk if i'll have enough to bring in bc there's three of us now,,. AAa they're so cute!! I wrote you in a couple places to no response about my order that hasn't been shipped yet - does this batch include orders placed in August? hnnn they're so cute!! i'm hesitant to commit tho bc I have 0 ideas and it's such a busy time orz when would you be doing the order? I understand! Thank you for letting me know :) I'll look forward to them!! <3. guh i really wanna revisit these banana fish charms i wanted to make a long while ago. lmfaoooo my bro insisted we make these brownies so he could see what I did differently bc his weren't getting the crackle on the top and now mine DIDNT CRACKLE??!? they were kinda horny tbh.  Charms by @lanimani  ! pic.twitter.com/3sWpjh51oA. OK MY BROTHER just saw me with two laptops and said "WOAHHH, DOUBLE FISTING IT" and now we're arguing over the most popular use of this. ok he just showed me that the top three urban dictionary definitions are in fact what he suggested they were and welp. i'm just a lewd i guess. Hehe their true homes are my ita bags but they’re just perfect for this . I’M SO GLAD I THOUGHT OF IT!!   I was like “I don’t think we’ve bought new Christmas ornaments for two decades.........!!!!” Thank you for creating these cuties . Jesus Christ it’s my last day to work on painting before my final evaluation and my brother decided to schedule physically and mentally exhausting shit for all day. I just want to rest. lmfao in taking measurements for my mom's christmas present i found the christmas present she got me..i mean I knew it already but i still feel kinda bad that I saw..whoops. I STILL HAVEN'T WATCHED THIS WEEK'S I AM DELAYING THE INEVITABLE. LIKE I DONT 100% knoW WhaT haPPENS BUT I SAW A B I G SPOILER A LONG TIME AGO AND I M N O T R E A D Y. hold me i'm  s c a r ed. working on my banana fish zine piece like a good girl. The cold has completely destroyed me my eyes and nose won’t stop watering I have a meeting BUHHH. Good thing I moved my meeting up bc we’re almost halfway thru my time and he’s with the student before me still djdndbd. I ADORE THESE DRAWINGS they're so gorgeous and painterly but also I have to say -- omg i want the baku hat LMFAO. Ahah maybe a cosplayer could make it. YOU SHOULD 
Lots of good round faces. Deep breathing . Also I’ve never watched this video - I usually listen to the recording that’s 15 mins long but I’m out and can’t find that rn  
 https:// m.youtube.com/watch?v=jbtFMD TKumc   ….  no prob !! Hope you continue to feel better :). Good ish news y’all? My charms SHOULD be here Friday - meaning they may make it to some of you by Christmas! ...the rest will prob be the day or two after orz You’ll receive a tracking number when it’s shipped so keep an eye out. i'm???? so sick of men???????????????????????????? these contractor guys take advantage of my mom + ghost her, my uncle treats her like his personal assistant + keeps asking to borrow money from her AGAIN, + my brother - i love him dearly - but jesus christ does he get upset at the drop of a pin and think his way is the Right way. also tryna christmas shop for my mom but i am a picky bitch
I never just buy random shit for people so that I have smth for them like no one needs more crap they dont like or want or use so I'm only gonna get stuff if I really think she'll like it.

OH NO THERES A BREAK NEXT WEEK..WAY TO..LEAVE US HANGING. LMFAOO algorithms. I couldn’t find my sketchbook so I made one and figured I’d just use it until I found my real one but I finished filling the one I made and still haven’t found the real one and now it’s been weeks and I’m WORRIED..I didn’t think I LOST it but now I’m not sure.. good news: plans changed so I'll be trying to get as many packages out by 5 today as possible
bad news: my last remaining button maker is having issues. I feel like it's fixable but I don't have time to mess with it right now so I can't include christmas buttons like I wanted :(. woah woah -- can I ask where this Kiri is from?! THIS IS VERY VALID

LMFAOO THANK YOU FOR LINKING ME TO THIS BLESSED CONTENT.....

Sjsjshsjs ok I had to see why those comedians were trending and wowee that clip was so uncomfortable to watch .

I really need to see this come to fruition. this is very soft u wu. I’ve seen zine with up to 9 mods   h o w. somehow I have never wrapped a present in my 22 years of living so pray for me rn. I jokingly asked my mom if I should wrap her gift to me since she knows i know what it is but I couldn't keep a straight face when she asked if I found it (I did, in looking for information for her present) and now she's like '.....i can't remember where I put it' EDRSHGDG. I didn't wanna cut the piece my bro gave me so I just put them all in bags \o/ another day, another skill not learned. lrt seriously

Also the video is really lovely
 https://www. youtube.com/watch?v=kOyBht PF5aw   …. dfsghisgd omg
I HAVEN'T I am torn about whether to read it now or to read the whole manga first..thoughts? :O. I peeked at it earlier today while being indecisive and omg i'm so sad sing got big I loved a smoll boy LMFAO. big mood
me: I need to return these books to the library
me: ....library...... I’ll look forward to it. Aaa no worries at all! I’m so glad it arrived safely and that you enjoyed the doodle . Me: mom it’s so frustrating how you never listen to me
Mom: what? Yeah I think it’s in there
Me: ..... Omg my mom’s been moody bc she only got me one present and I keep telling her not to worry abt it but she doesn’t listen. Then just now I’m going thru con stuff+I’m like what the hell is this and SHE GOT ME MORE PRESENTS BUT FORGOT.... anyways now I’ve spoiled Everything lmfaooo. Someone asked for a doodle of Ash + Eiji in Christmas sweaters for their birthday order - What was I gonna not do it?  
Merry Christmas y'all pic.twitter.com/mLdBkmSZPd. I’m not really happy w my last drawing but I knew it would make everyone happy so I posted it . It was such a cute prompt . I need more asheiji matching outfits in my life . Bro: If it gets late we can always finish it tomorrow
Me: BULLshit! No one ever /Finishes/ a game of Monopoly. HAVE U ACTUALLY FINISHED A GAME?? Update: my mom had bad luck and got wrecked, my bro and I couldn’t come to a single trade agreement, and no one ever got any monopolies. my mom gave up and bro got tired, I had the most $ and properties so I “won” for once but it was really unsatisfying  https:// twitter.com/cambrasine/sta tus/1077401985329045505   …. Oh wow...Strong. Oh shit I only ordered from them once but I did Not know this
Thanks for the heads up! LRT shit you didn’t know! If you’re looking for stickers I’ve been really happy with mine from  https://www. bunniesandcream.com/stickers    ! They’re shiny unlike stickermule, no minimum order. I can provide more info if u want or u can email them!! I’ve had some stickers on my laptop since August and they’re holding up fabulously ! I feel like I’ve have more followers if I drew more
Like that’s a really stupid and obvious thing to say but..yknow what I mean? I doodle and make full illustrations but I don’t do a lot of in between or comics or anything which is what Content creators do yknow. I am so weirdly sensitive to light?? When I have a migraine it’s really bad but even just normally if it’s really bright out I sometimes feel like dizzyish? Yeee!! I prefer their shiny finish over stickermule's weird like..frost? anyway, plus like I said no minimums. I think it's cheaper sometimes too, depending on the quantity/size/type? i just sent feedback forms on one of the busiest days of the year ..whoops. I just needed a new sketchbook anyway but since she didn't have much for me my mom insisted on buying it and putting it under the tree and like that's cool but we haven't done presents yet and i'm ANTSY I wanna doodle lmfaooo. I will never uncover the mystery as to why I get stomach aches after ham egg and cheese sandwiches????? I thought it was something in the one at Dunk's but now we had homemade ones and it H u r t s???? I'm fine having all those things in any other situation?? quality content right here!! pic.twitter.com/LsfkDKnWf5. i definitely didn't just paint my nails, fuck it up, then cry about it if that's what you're asking. i feel like doing absolutely Nothing today.. I should probably be cleaning,,,,,,,,,. i just spent like 2 hours working on a drawing and i like it less than when I started .............................just not my day for art I guess. idk sometimes you just have to not force it if it's not working yknow
you'll just waste time struggling along when you should just switch to another task and come back to it another day, it'll be so much easier then https:// twitter.com/cambrasine/sta tus/1077733269062541312   …. lrt ohh this person's style is really nice. mmmm i wanna watch the night is short walk on girl w my family but it's not out on dvd til january 29th????????? :(. ok y'all what am I watching tonight?
the night is short, walk on girl is apparently Not an option

I've heard great things about both of these.. It was GREAT! I feel like there was no way to catch it all the first time so I really wanna rewatch it but looks like I have to wait D:. thank you friends!! i'll vote for that one too but I think my fam will wanna see the trailers toooo. bro: sooo no matter what we're watching an animated film tonight?
me: yep, I made the decision for us. one less thing for you to worry about! me: you picked Venom!
bro: you PROPOSED Venom!
me: yeah but u picked it
bro: from the list of movies YOU PROPOSED
me: yeah but. My mom just dug up some on and off brand my little ponies from my childhood * U* 
I decided these two ponies should be a pair before realizing they were really different in size and my mom went, "What, there aren't big and little lesbians?". Damn like 1. No 2. Did we see the same series? 3. Confirmed Bi 4. No. Dry food makes me think of dog food ... Shaking my head over here. Guess Eiji is a morosexual. We watched Wolf Children tonight u vu It was great !! I wanna watch the other tho and rewatch night is short walk on girl too! . Originals  They were well received in class, but getting attention for originals online is another story . . 

      I had fun making the shapes and using neon inks in the silk screened version of the first one. The other two were my first proper repeat patterns!!    pic.twitter.com/bE2OToXMJt. This is the kind of brand interaction on twitter that i'm here for https:// twitter.com/Drumstick/stat us/1078009166491340800   …. Friendly reminder for everyone - but especially for those of you who are running preorders during this time - USPS's annual rate increase is happening January 27th! Please be mindful of the new prices! Make sure to adjust your shipping charges accordingly! https:// blog.stamps.com/2018/10/19/usp s-announces-postage-rate-increase-starts-january-27-2019/   …. hnn I've been going most of the day cleaning (and helping cook for once)////somehow i'm way m ore tired than my fam tho i'm like..ready for Bed. these socks i loved the first time i wore them are weirdly rough inside this second time/post-wash and now my feet are ouchy :(. ot*kon organization was awful last year and their prices are fucking outrageous...last year was Not Great....... I'm only gonna apply for standard :\. suddenly i'm getting a new phone bc we switched networks and there's a promotion and my moms phone is like. taped together and has been for a while lmfaoo. THIS IS RIDICULOUSLY CUTE??? AND SO WELL ORGANIZED? TT A TT Thank you so much for supporting us and for sharing this ! . iphone 7 :O T-Mobile promo for like $10/mo. for 24 months til tomorrow
which is sad bc I bought a phone case and it hasn't come yet and now it wont fit LOL.....but I could now get the banana fish one..................(Sweats). we drove it actually wasn't SO bad....
but like it was also mini vacation to DC bc I'd never been..idk if i'll bother again..depends how dismal my con outlook is for 2019 lmfao. yeee! I had an SE which is too old so I could never get them TT A TT. i'm up to a very prosperous TWO over here . me, waiting to hear back from cons. This hasn’t happened to me (yet) but one of the least aesthetic things is when an artists posts a redraw with the original drawing to compare to - clearly happy with their improvement - and some rando comes by offering unsolicited criticism of “I like the old one better”. Why would someone create dry clean only SWEATPANts . My bro and I spent a few hours playing Pokémon Stadium 2 yesterday and it’s still so fun   It’s funny tho - we played the mini games too and I’m still good at and bad at exactly the same games as I was almost 2 decades ago . Omg what no it does not have that game..I’ve never played the first one :o. Omg ..I bet it’d be cheap to buy 1..I’m pretty curious lmfao. My bro is having friends over tonight and it’s gonna be weird bc we’re four years different which was a lot when we were in middle and high school  but now we’re all adults??? Like my mom was like “see if they’ll let you play (poker) with them” and it just seemed so funny. Oh no?! D: I’m so sorry this happened..no way to resolve it with them? never in my life did i think i'd be this sad (over banana fish). RIP us (also, ash). JSGDTHGJOFHDFHGMFHJgj. lmfaoo mappa can't seem to decide so.......can this b a choose your own ending story. almost a whole week later but i watched tsurune and wtf that was so soft...I can understand seiya and shuu a bit better now bc before i didn't know what the fuck either of their problems were and i was like k guess i'm waiting this out? LMFAO. i always live life on the edge w/o a phone case but uhh this one is brand new and it's just plain black which is boring af so i'm.....gonna get a case for the first time since???????????snk s1 LMFAOO? ok I bought this phone case. it was miserably cheap and is probably so awful and made of poison but i mean
look at him
HE pic.twitter.com/SouNrpBySM. i'll get a more serious one too i just. i was gonna try to *hang* with the *guys* but there ended up being 4 of them  + my bro so now i'm like uhhhhh this is a lot maybe not. i'm sad should i buy a thing
i'm not one to buy stuff to cheer myself up but it does sound like a good excuse to get bakugou nitotan w his lil skull shirt. at least one of the men in my house smells like axe why this. LMFAOO...................i didn't buy in advance like an idiot so it's like $60 fo him + jirou...her deep dope shirt is also v sillytho. i'll whisper it to him when he arrives u vu. fdGDHDH I CANT DECIDE IF I WANNA PART W HEr or not.. it was a near thing with the last plush keychain set.. wtf am i looking at 
is this..........official/? -squints-
i've never seen this weird looking boy in my life pic.twitter.com/cJK3wCAaBH. hero aca twitter please explain. what stupid shit should i spend money on to cope 
poll in replies pic.twitter.com/FVGCGJsUFG. pics in op. omg really...........rest stop kiri. you or him LMFAOOO. i love asheiji but y'all can't convince me to let a qposket figure in my house they're gonna kill me in my sleep. imagine, you wake in the middle of the night. this kirishima is sitting in the corner of your room , looking right at you. bakugou looks slightly less frightening and deku looks fine almost pic.twitter.com/1SGuQ98UqG. why do they always do him so dirty :(. saRGJOTDFH FUCKIJNGN RDSFc. me too he looks kinda pouty. they're so spooky
kewpies too. the hero aca kewpies are actually.......weirdly endearing..unlike the yuri on ice ones which were horrifying to me pic.twitter.com/R5ipmVmfOu. ........................i kinda want them wtf idk what to buy i dont wanna buy....more than 1 thing..............maybe 2 if it's the cheaper ones
/lays down. i asked my mom's opinion on what i should buy and she listed every other item in order of preference from first to last and she finished with "...and then the kewpies"
she'safraid. tryna decide which to buy is awful bc you never know which goods will become impossible to find or incredibly expensive. I fell asleep early cause I felt awful and now it’s 4:30 am and I’m about to walk right over these particular rooms which have guests in the room below (mine-> my bros, kitchen -> guest room) sorry my dudes. I love this devilish boy . I think the bnha are bizarre but somehow charming but if they started popping up in random places in my house I’d probably scream still. Honestly I think they must be shitty US merch bc they popped up all over sites in English when I googled and I never saw them anywhere else before..why can’t we do anything right /sigh. Omg   to each his own I suppose haha 
The other two in the set look less spooky imo, I think it’s just his eyes that are throwing me? The idea of a wider kiri plush is nice tho.. LMFAOO
Who knows...he’s a mystery...an enigma....he’s everywhere and nowhere. I think I crawled in bed at like 9:30. Sometimes u just gotta give up and go to sleep. It would’ve been fun to try to get to know his friends better or even just draw all night but . Sigh. LMFAOO BAKU AND DEKU TIED don’t let Bakugou see this poll I s2g u guys https:// twitter.com/cambrasine/sta tus/1078818332458082305   …. If my life were a romance (and it most certainly is not), I would have run into one of my brothers friends in the kitchen just now. He can’t sleep, because of his troubled past. We’d have a heart to heart underneath the moonlight, watch the sun rise together, and fall in love. I’ve been reading a lot of fics before bed. Deadass just let out a pleased hum when I saw the time was my birthday (5:31 5/31). I’ve. Been in bed got 14 hours... .,...*for. i know this is late but https://www. youtube.com/watch?v=TEyQZJ pHxnc   …. Jewish PuPu Platter  pic.twitter.com/GEMmoIagX0. tfw you have 60 free gigs on your comp but it can't back up my 16 gig phone ok. jesus christ I know it's hard having an unpopular fave but fun fact artists can draw whatever they fucking want . ohmygod i finally got it to back up onto my comp but now it's saying the new phone - which has twice as much space as the old one - doesn't have enough room and i'm. apple:  cannot update your account is disabled
me: (apple support)
apple support: ok you're all set now!
me: great!
apple: cannot update please contact support. the sales associate kept telling me my phone had 1/4 of the storage it did so i'd have double the space on the new one but turns out the new one has HALF the space guess i'll just die. we'd been getting along really well for a while but my bro got mad@me today bc i'm 'technologically inept'   it's our last day together for 3-6 months. Me: (doesn’t finish comic) 
Me: I should make it FOUR COMICS. In other news it’s been one hour and my iPhoto back up went from 1% to 0% and I’m about to lose my mind. I have ideas for 3 of 4 seasons now aaaaaa. Except the plot of all of them is Kirishima is cute and Bakugou knows this. Sometimes I just think about how many people there are and have been in the world and try to evaluate if I think a combination of actions has been done before. My bro just joked about eating soup while in the bathtub and I feel like that’s been done by someone somewhere sometime. Damn even before then I had lilo and stitch ocs . Cosmic brownies are either the best or worst thing in the world depending on if you’re in the mood for them . If you want a cosmic brownie and get a cosmic brownie it’s AMAZING - but if you want a brownie and get a cosmic brownie you’re like wtf is this crap . Ohmygod it’s like..you have photo proof of yours being Really fucked up how can people say this ??? Even if I’d had perfect service from a place and saw someone had this experience I’d be like “oh fuck” djdndjnd. In the last 7 hours my photo back up has gone as follows:

Sad times. Yeah..I have a bajillion photos and I need to get them off my phone and into the cloud so I can have enough space to switch to a smaller gb phone orz. I was so tired that I turned my alarm off???? I DONT REMEMBER DOING THIS damn guess I was Out. Pet peeves include M/M fics where the author feels the need to degrade women . Like fuck I get it he’s gay - but he doesn’t have to hate women or call them whores or bimbos or whatever. Or have the one lady in your story be conniving or airheaded tryna get in his pants. This keeps popping up lately . Filed under shit I didn’t sign up for. me: my big bro left but at least I'll have tsurune today..
internet: bitch no u don't. sdfsdgdfg i am...so close yet so far to getting my phone sorted
after a long battle i got the GB on my phone down from 40 smth to 20 but now it's backing up as 30 anyway so i'm still 5 GB too much to fit on the new phone (Scream). someone just messaged me on ebay asking if they could buy my bro's old phone for less than the auction is currently at ??? also it has bids on it so it's not like i'm gonna cancel (could I even?)??? just bid on it or don't? writer: people loved this thing i'm gonna CHANGE IT ...more...White. ok I did the thing (read the article) and it says the rights holders wanted a western version of it hence hollywood vs just making it in Japan, and had lots of pitches to choose from.....but still, after ghost in the shell and shit people have a right to be skeptical.. and I think you're right, most people (including us) would prefer they stay faithful..sigh. I would like to give a big thank you to past-me for saving this voicemail of my grandma singing me happy birthday as an audio file bc I thought I lost it forever when we switched services...it does raise the question tho why is present-me more of a dumb ass LMFAOO. facebook ads telling me to bid on my own ebay listing....ya tried. Last night, around the house pic.twitter.com/InD6ig1G5m. Ps The pufferfish is unrelated lmfao. me: opens photoshop
me: does smth completely different than my three main wips. [DO NOT RT] I feel like I'm ????? all my sketches are line based obviously but i've completely lost the ability to like....make a drawing w lines? 
look at this ugly wip from sept that i struggled w so much I eventually gave up, vs a wip from tonight.. pic.twitter.com/v3EtqDP0oR. idk i say this but my miraculous anniversary drawing was w line and i'm happy with that...maybe it's just dependent on the piece.......sorry for my ongoing style identity crisis lmfaoo. squints.. i thought for sure grades would be in by now but turns out there's still a week left
antsy perfectionist lmfao................... Fuck midi this is my life on vacation..usually try to turn on any fan/air system possible and ear plugs.. Chill   Don’t burn yourself out before the new year even starts :O. If it still fits I’m gonna wear the same dress as last New Years don’t@me. OOF that’s a no fucking go. I’ve been eating well lately since Adams been cooking and I was on a good schedule..but we also snacked a lot...rip.  so soft .... In what is the first - and sure to not be the last - bad decision of 2019, it’s 3 AM and I just ate a ton of Chinese food and part of a chocolate bar. I’m just saying if you’re gonna make a candy bar and the serving size is 1/3 of a bar then MAKE THE BAR THE SIZE OF 1/3 OF A BAR u know I can’t be trusted ??? I’m sure you’ll have this moment soon. These are very good goals!! I def feel some overlap too   Happy new year, and good luck!!! You can do it !!! Me: wow! It’s warm!
National weather service: HIGH WIND WARNING gusts up to 55 mph KEEP YOUR ASS INSIDE IDIOT  
Me: :( :( :(. I feel like every pair of socks I own SHRINKS ??? This pair I loved this summer is now like 2” shorter than my foot...Idk my mom just bought men’s socks cause she’s fed up . Hm hm I’m in a pretty good mood! I hope it lasts !! I’ll do my best haha. wahhh I took cady out cause she needed to go and it was sooo warm even with the wind so we walked around for a minute but i'm glad I came back inside bc it's...real windy...as was warned......I hope it settles before it gets dark! ; o;. hey this band is good. i've been jamming to still feel for like 6 months without getting sick of it
feel like they're between hippo campus and twenty one pilots sound wise ; o; https://www. youtube.com/watch?v=9FzrD4 7v0zE   …. ok!! I'm gonna work on one of my deadline drawings and one of my self indulgent drawings today!! besttt of both worlds. hello vote on which personal drawing i should finish
disclaimer: sometimes i don't do as i'm told. hello vote on which deadline drawing i should finish first
disclaimer: sometimes i don't do as i'm told. (After yesterday’s weight gain debate)
Mom: I think your boobs did get bigger 
Me: Excuse you my eyes are up here. AC*N sent waitlist emails to some people weeks ago. I emailed asking why me and a few friends hadn’t received anything but no response, then today they send a general lottery closed/waitlist email   but why didn’t my friends and I receive that weeks ago? So confused djdjdn. Like either way I’m not in but like there has to be some reason why some people got the emails then and some now and I am always so curious djdbfhd. god ebay resellers are the worst??? I was thinking of just buying smth thru there instead of yahoo auctions but now bc they're on their last one they raised the price $7 /eyeroll. lmfaoo did you get this email too tho??? 
I just don't understand why it was split up.. hmmhmm  I wonder! I've done both for that class though, and before this I was switching back and forth too... ..lines..lineless..painterly.../looks into mirror who am i. Aaa thank you!! I never did go ahead with it haha pins are pricey and I feel like it's too obscure;;. It's so odd to me that some artists make content based on their audience like..idk ..I draw what I want to draw and I usually know how well it will do or not based on the content but I'm still drawing whatever. idk I don't think there's shame in either way..I guess it's just whether you find audience interaction or drawing for yourself more fulfilling? or you can flip back and forth? who knows.. just musing ignore lmfao. i'm...i'm not really hungry..but the food is hot..what am i gonna not do it. That makes a lot of sense! I definitely feel twinges of that sometimes -- like if I'm returning to a con after a year and have to stop and think "...did I make anything new since I was last here?" asdfghjkl. I can't imagine the pressure artists who do like seasonal lines every quarter or just have to create new merch constantly to feed themselves must feel,, yknow. yeah!! or like..having to cultivate your appearance/posts to be ..professional..to get jobs..or represent your rep/company......when you consider all that, i suppose I'm happy like this for now haha. hello...art friends...pls dm me.. I need your opinion but I dont wanna post the full thing yet > n<. maybe this drawing is actually fine but i've just been staring at it too much,......when I take too long to finish a drawing after starting it I tend to hate it before i'm even done > A<. big moood......HE LOOKS GREAT THO!! It's always hard drawing new characters but ya really did him justice!! P r e v i e w     Wish me luck!   I'll post the finished version when the results are out > O < Meanwhile I've got another in the works . . . pic.twitter.com/Kb0DwVuPwg. [do not RT] I worked on the thing like you said to pic.twitter.com/HAC3DwT2oc. Fuck. I didn’t feel good so I napped and my mom went out and she just called me and sounded weird so I asked if she was ok and I guess some guy just smashed into her car but she said she’s “absolutely fine”...but she’s the kind of person who doesn’t want to worry others so.. Time to sit here and worry   she said “it’s gonna be a while”. Ouch...... pic.twitter.com/7hmLTMROrR. Damn. My mom once got in a bad accident when this guy fell asleep so she’s always worried about drunk drivers so we always avoided certain times during the holidays and we made it thru them then two days later this impatient dumbass decides he’s gonna just GO I’m fuckin... I didn’t feel good so she went without alone   so now I’m feeling guilty ...there’s no way to know if we would’ve ended up there at the same time tho so i need to stop w hypotheticals orz. She’s salty bc she was driving really slow and paying attention lmfao  she didn’t cry when she got home so I guess she’s fine, just frustrated bc now we need a new car orz. Omg   yeah that was like here - they were folllowing the car in front of them but like damn y’all you gotta L   K yknow . Thank you, you two! . She’s ok!  Thank you Mai. Also here’s an apology to every artist I follow: sorry I didn’t see any of your work for months then suddenly RT it all at once. why is mina so hard to draw?
I've drawn her a few times but i always struggle!! three security questions later and I feel like I don't even know my mom anymore LMFAOOO. did.. did I ever post my café drawings? hm. I just RT'd my other BNHA café draws, but I don't think I ever posted this one! I wasn't happy with it then (chill with the dissolve brush, jenn!!), but Mina herself is still pretty cute so I thought I may as well share it!  pic.twitter.com/Z0jx52by2h. in the end, all those drawings I just posted are a year old or more so I'm not in love with them but idk..just kinda felt like posting them. I had to simplify this lil guy even further to make him readable in the drawing I just finished, but I like him like this too so...here he is lmfaoo pic.twitter.com/lmZkmaepeo. shoutout to photoshop for always freezing and saving over shit so I now get to decide between the old version with layers or the new version, completely flat ,,,,,,,sigh. i always fiddle with the little elastic band on my tablet pen but it tore so now there's nothing to play with :(. MMM looking back idk that either of these drawings has 'general appeal' but. welp. too late. this is a really nice idea.......... are we,,,,, old. ...WE DECIDED TO GO GET JUNK FOOD THEN REALIZE WE DONT HAVE A FUCKING CAR ...........  A little late, but I hope 2019 has been treating you well so far, my friends  
Let's do our best to continue growing and improving this coming year!

(I drew this for smth else, but I thought it was cute for New Years bc of the content so I edited it  ) pic.twitter.com/TX7IlSe79L. YEAH BUT only when I'm swimming????? it's so weird??? mmm i'm so excited for this new big 3 drawing!! i'm cranking out stuff rn ... now If I could just figure out my zine piece orz i feel stuck.. Day 3 and I’m still feeling pretty good!!! I think it’s bc I haven’t been doing stressful things but unfortunately life isn’t that LMFAOO. I think it’s like probably scientifically true that writing/setting goals makes you more like to do the thing so uh one of my mental resolutions is to call myself stupid less often \o/ I didn’t realize how frequently I did this until my yoga class last semester. I think overall “compassion towards yourself” may be a better way of framing it. omg I poured all my effort into this paper for class and I got a 100 (Yay!) but her comments to me are usually like a paragraph long and this one is just one line she must be tired reading all these. OHH GRADES ARE UP.. I feel so validated.. lmfao I think this is what happens when you're one of those kids who's good@school orz. Art history friends send help who was the painter this painting vaguely reminds me of? He was a drunk and was friends w another famous artist til they argued and one pulled a knife on the other and he eventually moved to Thailand and painted then died there pic.twitter.com/YCKxsDZlbs. You were correct!! It was Gauguin. Going to gynos feels so pointless cause all they ever do is try to throw bc pills at u to make u go away. Oops I misread the first time
Yeah I was on them for about 2 years bc of irregular periods and it got my cycle in whack but my periods feel more painful now orz it’s roughly but not always worse every other time and I had ovarian cysts in the past so idk who knows ..sigh. It took me like 4 brands to find ones that didn’t have as bad side effects and of course they’re the $50/month ones and still had kinda bad side effects the first month on and first month off. JEJDUDNDNDN $400?! Jesus!! I was told by my doctors that $50 was ridiculous already... I think it’s not good to be on it that long(unless u have to, obviously), may cause cancer and my mom had cervical cancer for a hot sec so I gotta be careful of that probably. oi...i can't imagine.. i'm only bedridden 1-2 days if it's a bad month sdfgdfh
there's not another brand you can try that's not as outrageously priced? hnn this guy who bought my ebay listing is Not going to be happy with the shipping cost to NZ bc it's in the second weight class but like...it's on you for not asking before buying buddy > n< who does that?? I HAD NO IDEA SEASON THREE OF MIRACULOUS STARTED ALREADY w h a t

  Drew more backgrounds, environments, animals
Personal faves: pic.twitter.com/hdof7sodIp. My personal life in 2018 was filled with Bad Times TM, which often negatively impacted my self-care/productivity/motivation, including my artwork, so I thought it would be nice to look at the positives and accomplishments from this past year. sorry for all the New Years content !! I think I'm done now haha
Just trying to reflect on everything then try to move forward with more positivity and purpose!! It's a good excuse to reflect and revitalize yourself, yknow? i'd be done w this drawing but tamaki is always givin me troubleeeeee. stick the leggy out real far pic.twitter.com/sg6NQ92dBR. update I looked up reference pictures of dudes sitting and i'm on the right track

It was inconclusive. Doodles for Kiribaku / Bakusquad comics I hope to finish...eventually pic.twitter.com/ckDxZniD5H. I love these men and these tweets. LRT these expressions are golden .. jesus christ my mom got a concussion. FUN FACT: Turns out you don't have to actually /hit/ your head to get a concussion! Just a sharp whip-lash motion can do it. My mom went to the doctor today just in case cause she felt a little off. It's funny (well, not funny, but yknow) bc she got her words a little garbled and I asked her "did you get a concussion? did you hit your head?" and she was like no I didn't hit my head and we laughed orz. She also like slept a normal nights sleep and then last night she slept from like??? idk 6 to 10? I didn't want her to get off schedule but I decided she should rest so I didn't wake her;; Welp. Time to do concussion recovery research. I'm gonna have to police her a lot bc she doesn't know how to do nothing. WOW! I'm so sorry to hear that!! Yeah I'm gonna be !!! A good daughter!!! and give her shit until she does nothing!!!! I'm reading about what to do now haha. yeah, I think she's just freaked out at the concept. We both get anxious easily;; If she just does as she should she should recover p quickly. LMFAOO THIS NOTE. My mom, 45 minutes into 'doing nothing' bc of her concussion: "99 bottles of beer on the wall, what the fuck am I supposed to do?~". I decided to take a break from the drawings I was stuck on and go back to one I didn't finish a couple months back! me: sigh, I wish I had orders to fill so I could be productive but not be on the computer..
etsy: girl you have four new orders pay the fuck attention

He's gonna be out of service for a few days so he can't even lecture her over the phonedsrgdg bad timing.. can we pretend this ponyta has anatomical differences from a horse bc she's a pokemon and not bc i can't draw horses LMFAOO. mom: it's 9:40? I thought you said it was 9:13
me: I did say that. When it was 9:13..
mom: ...............................are you sure
me: (looks into camera) ok yeah you're fine. mom: I have to light my shabbat candles
me: now I KNOW you're just lookin for shit to do--. DAMN  I went four whole days without *finishing* a sentence in which I called myself stupid ... there's..work to be done. AA Thank you!! That's a really good way to look at it! I had the thought probably half a dozen times but before I got to 'stupid' I cut myself and made a different statement. This book I read was like first notice, then cut it off earlier and earlier so..STEP ONE LOL. *CUT MYSELF OFF omg very important distinction. woah!! I've been working this way recently.. i feel so validated
(ps this looks great!!). . . . 

Artist Jennie wants to battle 

I started drawing this when that 'tell me what Pokémon would be in my team' meme was going around. As you'd imagine, this isn't really my ideal team, but these are just a few of my favorites from back in the day! pic.twitter.com/3YCVDLJ1W1. Shit on eBay is so overpriced that I’m buying smth that’s been marked up, paying for service fees and domestic and international shipping - and it’s going to be the same cost as the eBay listing, except this way I *also* get Jirou
OK IM DONE SHOPPING..I just wanted skull t Baku.. Aaa I’m glad you enjoyed it so much!! I need to go again too!! . ew. “What year is it now?” - @grimmfirefly. I went to an exhibit where the whole premise was flawed bc it was like LOOK JAPANESE PEOPLE LOVE HELLO KITTy - THEYVE ALWAYS LOVED CATS and I was like uhhhhhh actually—- . I was extra salty bc the exhibit didn’t end up being about hello kitty or cats   but yeah like damn lady do some research . Reply w fave cat or Aizawa pic? Honestly some bunny cosplays end up being lewd but yours is pretty modest?! Not that it’s anyone’s business to police how you dress regardless  

The butt bow is freaking adorable!   You worked hard and it looks great! . Ohmygod I’m glad you got it on tape, you’ll need it in court . I just want a nice walk but rain followed by wind followed by damn it’s just cold LMFAOO it was 19 feels like 6 here last night. Bro: I went diving and saw dolphins and sea turtles!
Me: mom insisted on making brownies then got dizzy from the circular motion of stirring  

I was kind of relieved to not go on that trip right now but damn wouldn’t have had the crash, it sounds like a better time. What program do you draw in primarily? I adore this crossover on all accounts, but I think it’s extra good bc of a couple of shared qualities between the four of them?! (Bakugou + maka are studious, stubborn, ambitious, Kiri + Soul are rowdy, shark-toothed, etc). @ aitaikimochii  hello!! Please consider deleting this RT and retweeting the artist ( @chipotlea  ) instead of the reposter!   They deserve the credit and attention for this amazing idea and drawing ! It’s linked further up. I see!! I haven’t tried CSP yet :o I’ve pretty much been using photoshop for literally everything since I started. My friend pointed out how that was funny so now I’m curious. The jingle for a local car dealership that I haven’t heard in who knows how long is currently playing on repeat in my head ...it’s only four lines...send help. LFMAOO Why is jeb bush gonna be speaking at my school? what is this shit. this is very valid but i'd have to win the tickets first and have my name publicly announced, sounds bad. "please clap". i have so many questions

LMFAOOO no no I'm just scared of,, corrupting them?? like if I wanna draw smth spicy or  like I DONT WANT THESE CHILDREN BEING LIKE 'WHATS A BANANA FISH" and pursuing that bc-------. but yes,, hello, fellow adult . tigers are cool. day 4 i'm tired i let my mom cook dinner i'm sorry. i drew todoroki from a weird angle so I just went back and forth like 3 times abt whether I colored his sides correctly or not. wow. mp 100 is just?? ?so good. ITS SOO GOOD IM EXCITED!!
I stopped reading the manga right when the giant broccoli appeared, I wish i could remember more and keep reading;;. I mean I remembered loving it but aaaa it's so fun to watch. my mom is rearranging the dishes in the dishwasher. it's so hard to help her, she's so particular grrrrr. I drew this when I took requests on Insta a few weeks back. Decided to revisit it and slap on some color bc I really adore the concept: Prince Todoroki brushing his horse!   

PS no matter what I do it always looks like the horse is staring into your soul..so, sorry everyone;; pic.twitter.com/fDMgzNoa7e. DSFGJRHF oh my god lani you're right tho
I love horses, also they're scary af. FUCJKDTHFGK. I just remembered in 7th grade one of our teachers had us line up according to how many bones we thought were in the human body and the answers ranged from 6 to 3000

Six bones.
Six.
Si. WHERE DO WE KEEP THEM ALL. are you ok. SDFGOJFH WHAT HAPPENED YOU LOST FIVE>? IS IT A SINGLE BONE NOW. I'm just ...I'm gonna do it.... I think you'll feel better for it so just trust me--
(rips out your last remaining bone). you're welc ome,,,,,,, 
good by e. only two more weeks of break
I still don't know what classes i'm taking next semester
damnit, diane. I lov him. LRT lottery thing was a bummer but not allowing sharing really has consequences. It’s bullshit anyway bc the alley will fill regardless, it’s just a dick move that’ll affect lower income people+students and as OP said prob disproportionately affect POC+affect who u see this year. Hnn my mom finally realized that this isn’t something she’ll bounce back from so quickly and got upset. I wish I could do more but it’ll just take time.. yknow whats weird
adams apples. i literally googled adams apple why immediately after this lmfaoo. Last year was my first year at Flame Con and it was easily the more diverse group of vendors, and I’d hate to see that suffer bc of a rule that seems greedy but ends up getting the con the same amount of money in the end . Self care time \o/. living for all this good mob fan art. @ grimmfirefly. Sleeping beauty... pic.twitter.com/PjHnhL1KT5. Late holiday exchange!! 
I drew @midimayo  's character, Salem! As you can see, I got a little carried away..Hopefully it makes up for not sending an actual card;;
PS I hope I did him justice, I always get so nervous with OCs  pic.twitter.com/evMmtFkV2t. i watched this weeks tsurune . LMFAOOO
"OK I KNOW YOU HAVE A TOURNAMENT SO STAY CALM BUT,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,HE MAY BE DEAD"
the team: ?!?!
me: ?!?! This sounds so sweet tho.. LOL. You've heard of flipping your art horizontally --- now, get ready for: FLIPPING YOUR ART UPSIDE DOWN!

Seriously tho my prof last semester loved to do this and honestly it has come in handy for spotting weird areas and issues in composition. RIGHT
I can't believe this idea was revolutionary for me . phew. not done but happier w my piece so that's good cause ITS DUE SOON. pic.twitter.com/FANE3tQXhs. wow. I don't love everything I make but I sure do feel like my eye has improved!! I was about to post a drawing I think I forgot to post back in August but I found a million changes I wanted to make, so I'm working on that now haha. Yeah!! We found out crab Rangoon is typically made w imitation crab when we wanted someone with a shellfish allergy to try it \o/. Idk how anyone manages to do this. OF COURSE!! Break!! Break time!!! . THIS IS THE WORST POST IVE SEEN WTF. LRT BIG FUCKING NOPE!!!! My dad cheated and when he hit my brother once, my mom was Done. But before that he was verbally abusive to her. I have few memories from that house. One was going to say goodnight to him and he yelled at us bc he was already sleeping and I cried. I was particularly upset bc I left a Pikachu plush in their room and didn’t wanna go back. Another is I remember hiding under furniture with my brother when they were yelling at each other. For a long time Id get disproportionately anxious when anyone would raise their voice. Sure it was rough, seeing him on weekends, then not at all, but it was EASILY the lesser of two evils. I have no doubts that had stayed together my bro wouldn’t have grown into who he is today+let’s be honest some of my issues stem from him already so I’d prob be Total a wreck . PS the big terrible crime my brother committed to warrant getting hit was dancing in front of the fish tank.

what a great example of misdirected anger . PHEW HI TWITTER sorry for the personal shit but that post was so so so awful I had to. Ahh I posted my story too but the living together making your relationship worse thing is so valid. I loved my grandma very much and saw her often - but the times we lived with her were full of conflict. Sometimes you’re just incompatible that way and it can cause strain. Slams fist on table
Give me..More fruits basket news!!! Clearly the tweet of someone who has no experience with it . Damn I had a dream I had a new Miraculous to watch but ‘twas only a dream ... I forgot to post this drawing a few months ago - so I made some changes and..tada! Here it is!

This is my boy...I made him 1000 years ago (2010?) so I gave him a bit of an update. His name is Marceau but idk why?? That's so French!? HAHA.. I still kinda like it for him though.. pic.twitter.com/zSNHpkhX3u. DFGDFH THANK YOU ZAMBi,, QUEEN OF CUTENESS. TT u TT THANK YOU!! 
sgsdihg Don't we all! I don't even have many ocs - like 10 or less - but I've got a second white-haired boy . asfhsdg Thank you!! I seem to be doing mostly lineless lately and it makes me second guess myself a bit so I'm really glad to hear this TT u TT <3 <3 <3. For reference, here's my first ever drawing of him 
I kept the main idea of him but I'm over his dip-dye and like - blazer ?? over t-shirt?? with tie?? tee over pants and belt over tee????? LMFAO pic.twitter.com/Y9BWPMUJm5.  honestly, I didn't expect he'd have so many fans!! I'm so glad!! I would literally die. I've had peeps cosplay my designs for characters (well, you know HAHA) but never an oc! :O PROB CAUSE I NEGLECT THESE UNDERDEVELOPED BABIES SO BADLY . LMFAOO "laying around" makes me imagine them like strewn about the floor   
Ohh, redheads! I have a couple of brunette vague self-inserts..I've been trying to develop them away from that tho;. haha It is fun!! I just want to change them. But I hate when people give others crap for stuff like that = Like back then my friend and I made magical girl ocs for ourselves and our friends!! It was very precious. everyone seems v excited about the promised neverland but it looks dark af ; n;. @ grimmfirefly. Ohh!! Maybe I'll give it a try then! I'm not really into horror or anything but i did survive banana fish ..barely LMFAO. (thank you!!). Ohhhh!!! Good luck!! me, like every day for the past week: I'm gonna finish this drawing tonight!
me: (just doesn't do it). I've been meaning to put this enamel pin up for weeks and I literally just forget to photograph it while its light out every. single. day. I've done other drawings just like damn jenn it's 90% done fucking finish it LOL. I hope this person is a dumb 14 year old like I used to be 

If they like incredibly stressful and action filled animes with gay romantic subplots that just happen to exist within the larger plot and are not BL then NO.6 is amazing. Aaa makes so much sense tho! Like variations of the phrase “your portfolio should contain the kind of work you WANT to do” Sometimes it’s tempting to include studies you’re proud of but its important to keep that in mind or you may get people contacting you for the wrong things. AAHDMDKDNDNSNCmdmfnxnf my god. Holy shit that’s amazing. Gaaaaah! I hate this! I struggle w insomnia and my bro is always like “just go to bed earlier!” Like that’s Not how it works my dude. HONESTLY IT DIDNT HELP. Damn I was in such a good headspace for a while.... what happened? (Well, I know what happened but..damn LOL). WHEEZE /maybe/ mr. disco :( my mom loves them too but now the bright lights/loud noise/sounds may be bad for her concussion..I’ve been flip flopping on selling the tickets all week...luckily we hadn’t sold the tix to RI on the 19th yet so we’ll see. *crowds not sounds lol. Ok literally 80% of the time someone draws Hagakure in a fanart where it’s a bunch of characters hanging out, they’ll draw her in a tank top and my brain goes “why did they draw a plastic bag there” AJDMFKDMCN. hypothetically if my laptop fan broke would my computer just like explode or. ehhehe I gave bunbun the ball with the bell in it and i can hear him playing. guhh I hope to move off storenvy soon it's such a pain. [ RTs   ]  I'm so excited to finally share this with y'all - I finished it way back in August! I'm proud of it, and I'm happy to report that it's been well-received at cons!

   This design is available - as an enamel pin or vinyl sticker - online@ http:// cambrasine.art/shop-all     pic.twitter.com/eIa0BPogsT. 100%. aaa thank you nini!!    The cheeks and freckles are screenprinted! It was my first time making a pin that had that :O It's a bit more expensive but great for details you don't want outlined in metal~. yeah!! I've seen some people use it for text and stuff too!! swdfghj I'M SO GLAD YOU LIKE IT!!    (And that it reached you safely!!)   oh my! what an honorable spot~ haha. I had no idea either! I think a friend told me about it :O I still don't quite understand /how/ but.. Thank you!! I find the beach and the ocean really peaceful .. gahh when I look at her her sunkissed skin.. is it summer yet? HAHA. Ohh, do you live inland?! I can't imagine being too far from the coast ; n; We're an hour or so;;. lmfaooo i just sent my hair dressed a very long email in my most recent attempt to get purple hair. If you've been with me for some time you'll be aware of the many misadventures I've had in this endeavor these past few years, so please send good vibes;; orz. Aaa good luck to you too!! Hair is so tricky . me this morning: I can't believe I put on like 8 pounds? How did I even do that?
me tonight: (eats 2 McDonald's cheeseburgers, chicken nuggets, fries, and a mcflurry). THATS NOT HOW I GAINED WEIGHT THO IVE BEEN CRAVING MCDONALDS FOR TWO WEEKS I was being good. and I've been good about walking too, and cleaning the house was a ton of exercise.. I think I just got used to eating 3 square meals a day with Adam home and snacking..maybe the problem is during the semester two days a week I'd average a meal and a half  .... moana was very good.  B I G  3 !  

I can't wait to see the senpais in action next season - and you anime-onlys will fall in love with them too, I'm sure of it!  

( PS I want to make a charm/standee of this for myself, so in case someone else wants one I put them up@  http:// cambrasine.art/shop-all     ) pic.twitter.com/ncjrjmMluU. Ps they’re arranged in a 3! It was clearer in the sketch. I don’t even have a mouse but I need these. Denki May be a harder sell but I’m sure Deku + Baku (and Kiri next season) would sell!! Put some beautiful art up in the kitchen 

Prints by @cannedcabbage  , animalsleepstories, apron by @giraffewiz pic.twitter.com/RomCAw6ntM. dfDSGHGfuck it's COLD 
When the wind blows it feels like someone put an ice cube directly on your face. con year is shaping up to be...............sp..ar..se... . . . Overheard “You can’t just eat a lollipop you found stuck to your clothes, you don’t know how long it’s been on there!...You little weirdo.”. I know bb...maybe the $ from the others can fund him??? Seriously tho!! NOTHING LIKE REMEMBERING ABOUT A CON THE DAY BEFORE THEIR APPS CLOSE. blessed. (repeatedly stabs at base to make room for Big 3). Yes!! Some people do tododekubaku or kamimomojiro too...kiribakukami ...I think it’d be a good idea tbh!! Or like friend/internship squads or whatever !!! lmfaooo Kiri is always so busy in your pics!   I love it. LRT I knew rates were going up but the zone thing is Such a pain in the ass wow. So turns out Andrew McMahon of Andrew McMahon in the Wilderness was freakin Jack's Mannequin and I am so confused but also it makes a ton of sense. LRT TW transphobia / general awfulness (yikes)

Was gonna  block them + just scroll by but ...they really drew some gross shit like their character boiling trans people so that's Real Fucked Up. And they have fan art for BNHA so. Just letting y'all know . . . i just read a ton of discourse im' so tired. Yeah@n@ same stuff over and over again too so it’s really pointless to read. Weeps yeah just mentally tiring and unproductive. What the fuck someone asked this zine if they could apply even if they knew nothing about the anime (1/2). Why would u ..why would you even Want to?! That’s like Time+energy. For a book w contents you don’t understand? You’d have to do research or make something meaningless?! I mean y’all got free will but I can’t understand. it also seems like taking it away from some1 who cares(2/2). This is just..so lovely. Wow. I love this too. You’re killing it lately! . I think the way you incorporated your writing is so lovely! You should do it more often if you feel inspired . Noooo the cute girl at the salon (who is definitely Cat Woman) graduated to stylist meaning she won’t wash my hair anymore..she gave the best scalp massages..RIP........the new girl last time was....er..not as skilled.........IM HAPPY FOR HER THO, just sad for my scalp. touching dog food is one of the worst sensations. sobbing someone buy my tix......................................my moms still recovering a bit so we're going next week instead. Poll in replies! 

It was suggested that I make Valentines cards out of the Pocky packaging design I did. Would y'all prefer horizontal orientation where they're both on one side, or vertical orientation where they're on opposite sides but unfolded you see them both? pic.twitter.com/3Sh3OdOOCJ. Pic in OP. someone: *buys the whole set of characters except kirishima*
me: you come into MY house and —-. Infinite luck. Me, actually: thank you for your patronage 

. Great news guys I just received a really legitimate e-mail saying that because I have "the same name with" this man's "decease" client, I am entitled to "5.7 million (Five million seven hundred thousand united states dollar"! but picture this - you're like, /really/ thirsty . lrt oh damn. IF I COULD I WOULD . GoFundYou. Seriously tho I wish I could count one on hand the number of times I've told someone to go to a doctor only for them to say they don't have insurance and can't afford it..a fucking sad state of affairs. olaplex is like gold
in that it costs as much as gold does. The people have spoken! Thank you for voting friends, I'll get on that~. i never take the time to take care of my hair until the few days before I'm about to douse it in chemicals again. whoops. [RT ] Valentine's day is coming, and I'm making some fun P*cky game themed cards   

Available in 2 flavors -   (red) and   (pink) - to suit your tastes.  
You can grab a single card for your sweetheart, or a discounted set to spread the love!

Shop@ http:// cambrasine.art/shop-all   pic.twitter.com/1iYlFEkp2W.  Thank you so much! It was a school project last semester, but I'm glad someone suggested Valentines for it!! PS If you were the person who suggested making Valentines from this then pls send me a screenshot of where you said it to me and I'll give you a free set! SORRY I'M FORGETFUL.

IT COMES IN THREE COLORS  pic.twitter.com/EkZ40ykcrH. humans haven’t existed for hundreds of thousands of years just for you to have to figure out everything by yourself! . LRT this but also fun color hair. I remember when I first dyed my hair purple I went to the mall right after and I was like EVERYONE IS LOOKING AT ME (idk if they were tho). LRT mine told me I should be a radio DJ like bitch have u met me I just told u I was introverted. I feel so betrayed when I go to sleep and wake up w the same piercing headache. Idk why this is so funny?! It almost feels like a joke bc we’re way past that??? Right like this is what people say abt people who commit minor offenses not this fucking guy and like even before he was president so she’s like 4 years late LMFAO. AAAA Y'all are so cutE!!! . We're looking at cars bc we Have to and my mom's like /this ones got a stripe in the middle/ and i'm like /I want the one with the stripe holy shit/ and we're not even joking they fuckin Got us. mom: It's more expensive
me: WHY WOULD YOU EVEN SHOW ME IT THEN. Fun Fact about me. When I was a youngin' I auditioned for this Papa Gino's commercial. As you can see, I didn't get it. https://www. youtube.com/watch?v=ZPYAjP _q4Ak   …. Irk. Been drawing more the last couple weeks...Suddenly arm pain. I stopped when it was my bicep and inside of my forearm but today it’s like. Just above my elbow and now where else. Photoshop froze three times, saved over my work once, and lost pressure sensitivity twice so I finally updated . idk if i could change my composition for this piece any more times than i fucking did dfigfdhfh pls...i want to be..done. the working title is endme.psd. i' m not joking pic.twitter.com/Ghzws0dPI8. i will pay someone 0$ to finish this drawing for me. ok but in exchange u have to finish my drawing, thats the deal. hm i kind of mind. :\. shoutout to @grimmfirefly  who's been dealing w me yelling abt this drawing for a few hours and also has been giving feedback and also pointed out and also helped me fix the backwards hand on my other drawing recently and also. LRTs I dont kpop but this drawings amazing. LRT one con I went to wouldn’t let me bring in water. They sold it for $4 inside. Yeah!! It’s fucking dangerous. There’s usually a bubbler somewhere but if you’re an artist - esp solo - that’s not practical! I remember the first day the guy who did the bag check was like “oof I probably shouldn’t say this but —-“ and encouraged me to sneak it in . I’m soooo sleepyyyyy but I feel ..happy? Peaceful ? Lately I’m so tired? Or no I just am ..really sleepy? Like I sleep forever? And really deeply? A few times I woke up kind of disoriented (“when did they put a closet there?” and almost throwing a whole roll of toilet paper in the toilet disoriented). I can’t tell if it’s good like oh look you were sleeping worse before or if it’s like uhh is smth wrong w me. I know 100000 people have made this joke but seriously where are u guys getting these nice photos of yourself from 2009? Mine are all fucking Photo Booth photos w stupid filters on. a generational difference then bc not even joking the ones I found are me and my friend are hot topic tutus and arm warmers and shit. I wanna do the 09-19 thing but I’m waiting til I get my hair dyed Friday  in case it comes out good . me: *to the tune of Silvering Lining* Fuck a silver lining, fuck a silver lining, I am Brendon Urie  
my mom: haha you are!.....not!

Gotta do some math and sell the extras...I may keep a Yut-Lung... pic.twitter.com/r5DNkLF2it. WOW I SPENT A LOT ON THESE LITTLE FUCKERS. Pricing was a pain bc I know how much I paid total (resale price+domestic&international ship+agent fees) but when comparing to others selling people price based on character so 

NWT: Yut-Lung $30, Eiji $50, or both for $75

Free US shipping, $10 Canada, $14 Elsewhere pic.twitter.com/fYh0pnTAnB. Why is my school administration so bad

I sent my bro 4 packages priority mail, same day, time, place, and yet two arrived and two didn't. oh, usps..you never cease to amaze. has anyone watched Sex Education? Is it any good? I remember people made a fuss when the ad came out. LRT CAN U NOT ESDOGFHGfh. Ohhh good to know! Sometimes I wonder why people can’t just keep their mouths shut if they’re just gonna be rude af . Hey!It’s so challenging moving to a new place-let alone a new country. It’s so brave of you to study abroad. You’re doing it! I’m sure it’s scary, new things often are, but give yourself some time to settle in+adjust  I’m sure u’ll start feeling comfier soon+make the best of it! LRT (YELLING)

Joey played w my scrunchie til the elastic broke so now it’s a headband pic.twitter.com/j4VolrwORm. Twitter I just walked into the wrong bathroom. Hnnn like I appreciate them trying to make me feel better I guess but in the end I still don’t get to go..I have family there+had a nice time last year, so I reeeally wanted this one!  also got the Worst spot (staff confirmed)  last year so I wanted to see what happened haha. I see!! So far we watched two eps so I see what you mean. Curious to see where it goes  
Although I saw a major spoiler when looking up the actors . My mom and I both slept terribly and my fucking uncle is coming over
He’s so loud and also just an awful person hnnnnnn. guhhhh i'm sorry chris TT n TT here's to hoping;;. Casually leaves these kids here

Yeah, I'm ok, thank you <3 just my bi-annual 'oh-god-school-starts-again-in-less-than-a-week' meltdown. LMFAOO U HAVE DOUBLE OF MINE i'm cryin. This is stunning. i think I like, peaked cuteness-wise in 2014 :(. Ugh, yikes. This is my only platform that my fam doesn't follow so I can't imagine.. > n< Hope everything turns out ok;; . LMFAOO ITS ALL DOWNHILL FROM HERE. LRT !! Hey!! This is the one I'm in!! I'll post a preview of my piece soon~~~. mm what is this show y'all are watching w the very heterosexual 'do you have a girlfriend' and stargazing and stuff . ANDy...YOU DIDNT ANSWER THE QUESTION..................... *googles using hints from your tweet*. (ps the hetero part was sarcastic, I know sarcasm doesn't always come across in text). /casually downloads ep 1. No way would you be /clogging/ the tag! You deserve the recognition these tags can generate . lmfaoo I get that, I didn't do portfolio day cause I had just done a late 2018 review hahaha. AAEFSDGFDH HE'S SO FLIPPIN CUTE??!! YOUR STYLE IS AS CHARMING AS EVER  
Thank you sooosososososo much !!! This is only the second piece of art I have for him since giving him an update so I am Living . no hashtags, then too many hashtags . Omg I wanted to show my mom a joke but I was like wait she’ll need context and 
Me: (already pulling up an image on my phone) do u know One Punch Man?
Mom: yeah
Me:.....u know what he looks like?
Mom: yeah, yeah, the bald guy. What, you think I was born yesterday? 
Me: o...ok....  Thank you for contributing to his smoll gallery!! Do you mind if I post it on my insta story(and tag u)? pic.twitter.com/LTiuX5lcly. I guess she learned by osmosis by assisting me at cons?! It’s like? Extra funny bc I’m not in that fandom, I’ve never watched it at all, so it’s not like she would know that way omg. Lmfaooooo 
The best part was no one noticed and I could’ve just turned and left but I yelled WHOOPS SORRY WRONG BATHROOM as I pivoted   It happened that way in my brain and it just came out simultaneously. I like the varying colors, and I think they have nice silhouettes so I’d leave the bg pretty simple - maybe just a half tone gradient  or polkadots or little stars or hearts or smth? Or you could do like a simple shape based on the character - like lightning bolts for denki, little grenades or explosions for Baku, gears for kiri, etc.

Maybe pick one character and play around then see what you like best! pic.twitter.com/oUg0xw0W5L. LRT G..GROSS. LRT governent shutdown is killing me bc I really like deli turkey and I read not to eat stuff without a “kill” stage (high cooking temp that could kill the yuckies) as much as possible . In my dream I had to sit somewhere for a long time so I drew like dozens of pages in my sketchbook - some w watercolors and everything - now I wake up and I didn’t actually do shit . Omg this is an amazing idea??? I’m gonna steal it and make my boy pretty too?? And if they’re really so dense that they don’t get it, you get to screenshot the Merriam-Webster definition of sarcasm at them . Shdndj 5 more days til school starts (not that anyone’s counting) and my anxious lip biting/picking habit makes its first reappearance. me: wow, a whole month break!
me: ...can I have a few more months. Seriously... it would’ve been great to have a class to learn how to cook, sew, use basic tools, change a fucking tire, etc.
I feel like we live off YouTube tutorials bc we don’t know how to do basic things, and it’s not our fault orz. I literally had trouble opening a can the other day don’t@me . Just a cute denki package doodle  pic.twitter.com/Oy6UTVgFgD. I said don’t fucking@me. Please share. Yeah!! No problem! I’m excited to see what you end up with regardless :) they’re soooo precious. Omg...on a serious note tho I think putting them in a bag accelerates it bc gasses or smth idk I’m not a scientist . Where are y’all viewing the ice ado trailer ?? Is it just in japan right this second  and it’ll be online later ? @ Kyyhky7   I see! Thanks you two~ I’ll keep an eye out for it later u vu. Ohmygod we test drove three cars across three dealerships but we saw this really pretty and newer one and now my mom wants to go try that one. I told her “you’re weak” and her response was just “,.....but it’s so pretty” LMFAOOO. Is Skittles doing ok? Like financially? bc I feel like they’ve been using the same commercial for 10 years now. Or was their marketing team just like, “This is it. We have peaked.” https:// twitter.com/Skittles/statu s/1081248633767505920   …. I ask myself this question every day (Stares into the distance). guess who forgot to b99. update: 7 years, I think, but still. AU where Skittles has a bizarre collab w some STI awareness/prevention organization. Coupon for a bag of free skittles when u get your HPV shot. gahhh I can't believe I didn't set up the series recording so now I'm gonna have to wait like 24 hours to watch b99 and pray to not see a spoilerrrrr. hnn my body seems to have changed when i wasn't looking and i'm scared my ladybug suit won't fit anymore > n<. Here's the preview of my piece for   @bananafishzine    !  
We all worked hard on our pieces, so please give it a look~ 

Pre-orders are open now@ http:// bananafishzine.bigcartel.com   pic.twitter.com/6MP9tb5pGr. so happy to see yoi twitter alive and thriving <3. holy shit yes
Do you need refs or have you seen em?! yeah, no prob!! If you want more refs of a particular character feel free to ask!

In that case, I have these two recent refs by the lovely gomuboo and affectionatetea too \o/ pic.twitter.com/ueD0ZzUpEO. Uh was just looking at this towel and I don’t even think any of my family has BEEN to Ohio ?! pic.twitter.com/YycWkrr48p. Update my mom said it was my grandma’s WHICH I FEEL MAKES EVEN LESS SENSE. I’ve just been like eating and sleeping So. Much. these past few weeks?? Was I just starving myself of food and rest during school so now my body is trying to stockpile? Is it bc it’s winter and I am going to hibernate?  oh, cadence... pic.twitter.com/uAjhjAfoOn. ch 213 thoughts without spoiling
why do I feel like bakugou is gonna be pissed bc deku _____________
uraraka is very cute, as usual
monoma acts shitty, as usual. Hnn maybe doggo just misses person?! LRT this is it for me guys I can die happy now. I feel like there’ll be a pretty decent size group of people that are Not Happy w chapter 213 but Idk im down for whatever this seems like a lot of fun! Hnn maybe I’m just Too not picky . @ gabbyness  sticker info ^^^. Yesterday when we were test driving cars my mom was trying to ask if it had lane assist but she asked, “Does this tell me to stay in my lane?” and the dude and I burst out laughing. Very happy w the dye colors, pray it takes!! pic.twitter.com/veIAM449ML. I don’t know if they’re up yet, I think they were just announced . Hnn yeah I know some people stress eat (like my mom) but I’m more likely to skip meals at school and when I get nervous I am too hyped and nauseous so I don’t eat much..and anxiety affects sleep too..guh. They were better IRL than online so I’m feeling good just..as long as it..takes. purple, bitches  pic.twitter.com/DZfTMd8ADr. Thank you!! I’m happy . THANK YOU LIZ . Thank you!!  Haha I’m too lazy to curl my hair but I appreciate how she always does . It took four tries but we finally got a condescending car salesman . Can y’all believe I own one (1) lipstick and it’s black. I wanna wear it to patd tomorrow bc I feel like that’s the only time I’ll feel comfy ..or maybe like black market haha. Thank you!! Aren’t y’all so glad you don’t have to mute mc bc I won’t be complaining about my hair (for at least a few weeks)? Deer costume! Look how cute I used to be  pic.twitter.com/kWjXQwQnZk. MMM my stylist asked if she could put a pic up on her insta and i asked if it was work or personal and she said both but I forgot to ask for her handle aaa. ohh overtone? have you tried it? I've been looking at it a lot..they must spent tons on instagram advertising cause they won't leave me alone 
and yes, I got good (hopefully?) color-safe shampoo I'll use cool water even if it kills me! brrrr. normally I'm pretty forgiving about this stuff but we waited an hour and a half for 20 min take out (and no sourdough which I asked for specially :( ) while our groceries defrosted tonight so here's hoping ch**secake factory gives me free food lmfao \o/. ( I mentioned that they apologized and that it was busy and stuff cause i know shit happens and working in customer service is hell but it was still frustrating and wildly time consuming ). Ohh! It's a color depositing conditioner - well, they make a lightly pigmented daily treatment and a deeper weekly treatment - or smth like that. I haven't researched other brands.. 
eep! Well I have a sprayer head that comes off now so I may just wash my hair + shower separately. I slacked last  night / today but I..I think I replied to all my mentions but if I missed you i'm sorry pls@me. damn I forgot when I post on my personal insta my ex friend likes my posts which always makes me feel bad and also she's still cute . ahh yeah thats what I used to do!! cold hair wash then Scorching body shower lmfaoo. 1 AM tweets: veterinarians should be called dogters. This is a great tweet thank you two for blessing my eyes with it. I have to pee and luckily I’ve already reminded myself I dyed my hair so hopefully I don’t have a small heart attack lmfao it always takes a few days to adjust.. Hello friends!! I typically ship on Saturdays but due to the snow there may be a delay! I've got some ready to go and I'll try to get them out but they likely won't move for a couple days. Turns out I touch my roots more than I thought   the directions said no shampoo, just rinse after the application so I’m trying not to leave purple fingerprints everywhere. Guh been looking forward to this concert for 7 months but between my mom not feeling well and the snow... > n< I feel like she’ll decide last minute not to go. LMFAOO LEAVING IT BLANK WAS ALSO AN OPTION   if I retweet this do I become problematic?? . It’s a lot of money but honestly it’s an opportunity that may or may not crop up again, so if it’s one of your faves it’s probably worth it. This is the cutest shit I’ve ever seen . LRT My bro does stuff with mapping (Dont ask me, I’m not a science) and he was showing me some areas like this.. omg I was just about to email about phone cases bc it's been 1000 years but they came \o/. Actual product photos soon! Here’s some photos in the dark w flash on pic.twitter.com/iuz2x4iEq1. I gave her a treat and she still wouldn’t cooperate   I just wanted a nice photo of us... pic.twitter.com/l9avrADnnr. My mom finally agreed to go to the concert but she’s making me pack a shovel and “snacks” ..when the concert ends before 11 and snow isn’t supposed to start until midnight ... I can get her to look at /me/, at least pic.twitter.com/eB3iydYwAT. Shoutout to the girl at Sephora who furrowed her brow when I told her what shade of concealer, which reminded me that I needed the shade lighter bc it’s winter. I’m not even joking pic.twitter.com/0Y1vhsfIoL. Lmfao the counter just kept counting from 29 to 20 over and over and now 19 to 10 over and over   u ok panic. It took forever but home safe ! Anyway I’ve had one meal in the last 36 hours I did a Really Bad job at taking care of myself for the first time all break ...I want pasta but it’s 9 AM... Wow Pete Davidson and John Mulaney are a great pair . There’s so much snow I’m broken and all I did was a shitty job from each top to probably a total of 10 stairs. This is all I did and a bad job at it too I’m so weak...why are there so many stairs at my house tho sjsndhajs pic.twitter.com/k8jABlNnkl. MY MOM INSISTED SHE WAS JUST GONNA DO THE CAR AND I LOOK OUT TO CHECK ON HER AND SHE FUCKING FIXED MY MESS why can't she rest also why is she so good at this. update i had to shovel a lot more
shoveling is bad and hard why do i have so little upper body strength. LRT tw body horror. Phone case preorders arrived! They're matte + soft touch!
I only ordered a few extras which are up on the site, but if you want a certain design and model, just send me a message and I'll make a preorder for ya!  

Shop online@ http:// cambrasine.art/shop-all     pic.twitter.com/3iZKKlQax2. mom: ...That sound good to you?
me: ...........................I'm sorry, I have no idea what you just said.. You have to like, call me to attention if you have something to say to me. This is just who I am now. if my school changes the required courses one more time i'm gonna scream. MY SCHOOLS GRADUATION RATE IS 58.3% WHY AM I GOING HERE. tsurune was soft from start to finish, would recommend. W..WAIT WAS THAT THE ONLY THING YOU WERE MISSING??? IT WAS ALL VERY GOOD. @ eijisuwu. having the syllabus for only one class is really not helping me to decide. i guess there's nothing stopping me from taking 13 hours of class getting up at 6 and getting home at 10 except for the fact that that sounds absolutely terrible. ....THIS CLASS -- ITS TEACHING HOW TO SCAN/COLOR CORRECt/GET FILES READY TO PRINt..................................................................... - which I clearly know how to do--------- and ITS FOUR HOURS LONG?????? sorry i'll stfu about classes soon i am just so confused. Hnnnnn yeah that's what I'm looking at plus I commute at the mercy of the train  schedule so if I didn't get a ride I'd actually get home at midnight. (ps I'm sorry you did that it sounds terrible and you should be proud that you survived!). and i'd only have two fifteen minute breaks to eat between 8 and 9......................... I love when schools offer like 1 session of a required class, or only offer it during one part of the year . I would have class at 10 the next day + hour commute so. I think I'd break week 2 tbh > n<. yeah I'm gonna cut one of them it's just..the one I actually wanna take is the earliest and not required, vs the two I have 0 interest in but have to take to graduate. Omg..that’s wild..did they not help you find an opportunity or did you not do it for other reasons? (Sorry if I’m asking too much or too personal just shut me down! I’m just curious/for when I reach that stage)
I can’t believe the rate is that low tho.. I WOULD I COULD! RTing in case someone who follows me can. I hope you find someone! . *i would if I could . LRT also Todoroki being from a wealthy family but then he’s just like super blunt and borderline rude and yells at the police chief lmfaooo. Wow I forgot how much I love figure drawing when I’m in a rut. pic.twitter.com/Ql8KM8KmeV. Hnn I really enjoy his work too so I am also really disappointed :( I unfollowed bc I know any time I see him pop up I’ll only think of this . Poor Cady. She loves the snow but can’t handle the cold temps, her little leggy always gets stuck :(. damn I decided to just peek at Bumble out of curiosity and are all these girls fucking models or what. i'm gonna wash my hair with shampoo for the first time tonight....i hope it washes off my scalp but not my hair lmfao. I know, he's like really faithful to the ref so it's even worse > n< ..and flat out ignoring her and people who point out it's her...like damn. it's so windy that it's making whistling sounds and I can feel the house shake. The heat is set to 80 but it's 53-69 degrees in each room ; n;. I read a good chunk of the mp100 manga but i can't remember it nearly at all!!! is teru back soon/hit LMFAO. different but similar idea - i almost throw my socks in the trash instead of the laundry like once a month. Uncle: get (specific car)
Mom: It doesn’t have a good safety rating
Uncle: What, are you planning to die in the car?
Mom + I: ??????????????? i'm so stressed about tomorrow i've done nothing all day and everything sounds so hard idk what to do with myself today. up to nine more days before contest results are out (rolls around). I hope that number is an exaggeration   — Either way, do your best!!   If you make a schedule, remember to schedule in self-care, too . I guess we’re having chicken noodle soup and chicken pot pie for dinner cause we’re cold as fuck. Everyone I know (myself included) is struggling to get into any cons. I’m up to two so far . sometimes my brain goes faster than my hands, or my mouth, so I'll say 'storders' for 'store orders' or write 'withe' instead of 'with the'. Also if you've been waiting on an order with heart buttons - or if you've been waiting for some heart buttons to come back in stock - I should have  a tracking number today which means they should arrive in a few days or so! \o/ Thank you for your patience! <3. I do wonder if I should look into a new manu tho ; n; The last two orders have been ridiculously slow, I always have to correct the address, etc... They even just put in a random tracking number to beat the system since they agreed to ship it before now so I thought it was going to the wrong place and it was A Whole Thing. car dealerships keep leaving us voicemails and it's so scripted it's painful. No, not the same manu! I see both pluses and minuses (higher cost per piece, lower shipping cost, different min/max order, etc) when comparing to my current. I’ll definitely give this a try sometime! Wow, so many different holo options :o Thank you so much for the rec! for one, solitary moment I forgot (looks into the distance). should i eat again. i'm late (I wanted to do my hair first)
#2009vs2019  \o/ .. Except on the daily I'm not as made/dressed up haha

ps you'd be shocked at how many photos from 2009 have my hair covering my face...oh, 13 year old jennie, u fool pic.twitter.com/MKg6WPfIK7. i ate, but just a little
thanks friends.  asdfgvhbjnkml, thank u Andy;;. I am weak shdndjxid. Between my insomnia and general ill disposition to the morning I think I overestimated my abilities
People aren’t meant to rise before the sun is2g. Check my insta story for a dope infographic. They didn’t give me a tracking number today like they said 
*pretends to b shocked*. Yes. They don’t like me as much I guess LMFAOO. Sjsndjddhdndbdsbfuckingndhsbshsfhh pic.twitter.com/buNzAfea69. Sjsnsjajsj thank you   I feel like you’re always glammed up so it means a lot haha. They just don’t like me cause I don’t order like 1000 pieces anymore for zines lmfao. Me: I can’t believe I put on makeup to eat Burger King
Mom: At least you didn’t fly to the White House to eat McDonald’s. LRT guys I need more energy to be the proper amount of disgusted and angry about this. LRT what the fuck did I just read. LMFAOO THAT CLASS WA S SO STRESSFUL what the fuck. He’s crazy strict and demanded to know why someone gave one single laugh and someone left mid class and he was like why are you leaving and one of my classmates said he kicked her out of a diff class for her correcting him about her name wtf. I led my fellow dumbasses to the classroom. There were six or seven of us roaming around unable to find the room running in circles so when I found it I went back to where they were congregated and directed them Lmfaooo. i just bought reese's sticks for 19 cents what is happening today is so weird. petition to make it mandatory to list the syllabus with the course bc some of these descriptions are vague as hell. LRT LMFAOO HIS FACE. YESSS more artwork of my son!   Thank you so so much, he looks great! It’s so lovely - all the art I’ve gotten of him since his makeover is so different in style, I adore seeing everyone’s different trademarks and artistic decisions. Ahaha I seriously doubt that! Every time I see your selfies and outfits on insta I’m like damn I should be less lazy 
Aaa thank you! It’ll take some getting used to but I’m really digging it so far . I WISH I WAS CLOSER THIS IS SO CUTEEEE. Sobbing I wish I had any good local friends into banana fish so I could goooo (the unofficial one) it sounds like so much fun!! RLS IS SUCH A BITCH. No thank you . Aaaa congrats!!! 
I hope you enjoy it! Same w hq and free but seriously I’ve been enjoying mp100 sooooo much!! I forgot how much I love it. So I’m biased af but I’d rec that ;). Me: this has gotta be a 4 AM tweet 
Time stamp: 11:55
Me: *squints*. LRT I don’t understand how I do better some situations like asking others if they’re looking for the same room+guiding them there - yet terribly in others like knowing I put exactly .95 in change in my backpack but getting anxious when I fumbled too long + using a bill instead. Seriously like sometimes I’m impressed w myself interacting w my classmates yet there I am specifically separating the exact train fare way ahead of time so I don’t have someone staring at me while I count it out. I forget how bad it is sometimes since I was home a lot over break then yesterday I literally had the revelation of “oh u have social anxiety jenn” all over again . Yes! I always see this when people from Singapore order it’s like Singapore Singapore lmfao. @ BananaFishTour  ! There’s an official tour too from japan that is crazy expensive bc it has airfare and you fly in but some fans are arranging their own which is so cute ! This morning train is so much quieter...no one’s awake lol. OK they gave me a Real tracking number now so buttons should arrive Friday - which will be perfect to mail Saturday ! LRT great opportunity . i told my mom to stop eating instead of breathing and just take three deep breaths and she refused over and over until she started crying so that's the state of affairs over here. i wish mine did, i'd probably sleep well. assignment: you can draw or make it whatever
me: (draws smth i'd never physically be capable of making). i wish it was possible to google animals without like
a picture of that animal dead, covered in blood
or of that animal covered in blood with a dead animal (which it killed)
and like, bad taxidermy
I NEED ADVANCED SAFE SEARCH lol. my mom and dog are snoring on either side of me .............its making me........sleepy. I literally walked into dunks today, saw they had no chocolate chip muffins, left, and now I’ve gotten two twitter push ads(?????) and an insta ad for them and I’m so annsnddj  I thought I set my location privacy settings well what fresh hell is this. I literally have location services off for both these apps and safari and p much everything but maps . This tweet reminds me of when I found out two artists I followed were actually one artist with two different brands. me: draws penguin and polar bear
me: great job all arctic animals
me: ....wait. I guess so!! hahah. brain: you're stressed out about tomorrow
brain: wait.. there's nothing happening tomorrow
brain: well, whatever--- you're stressed abou---. a good song to listen to on a sleep morning on the train https://www. youtube.com/watch?v=OYOjQr R7P4U   …. This tweet made me realize she’s the only lady in the top 10.. re: bnha popularity poll

NO OFFENSE CAUSE IIDA IS A GOOD BOY TOO BUT IM SURPRISED HE MADE THE CUT?i think the US poll would look different in that way, I think Ochako or Tsuyu might make it here!! ( That’s just my speculation obviously ). LRT idk how I continue to be surprised by how out of touch w reality some of these rich fuckers are. nensjehdns the alarm sound gives me such a scare too. I use Sleep cycle as my alarm so it has different more comforting tones and it starts off soft and gets louder :) ...but eventually your brain associates even the calm melodies with “oh no”. Hnn I find trouble with that too when I draw ichigo but THESE ARE SO SOFT AND GORGEOUS..I adore their faces. me: Guess who got waitlisted Ooooootakoooon?~~~
mom: awwww noo, jesus chri---
me: THIS BIIITCHH~~. Buttons *should* be here tomorrow! I just sorted all the orders by item and got the labels ready to go. This student in my (required) class for illustration, where we learn Illustrator, asked me what my major was then asked me 100% genuinely “what even is illustration?” and I was just like,,, shocked LMFAOO. Idk how to describe this. I still get very anxious about school, I don’t choke on words much anymore, but I still talk really fast,think way too much about reminding myself to make eye contact but..in classes w lots of fresh/sophomores I’m really reminded of our age difference? Everyone’s different of course and like I said I’m still struggling but it’s like a weird out of body experience cause I felt like I was looking at a younger version of myself in the more nervous ones and was like wow I guess I am getting better at this. cause I wanna like big sister this person, pat em on the back and tell them not to be nervous even tho my own palms are sweaty? Like the girl next to me was nervous+I was reassuring her that it wasn’t a serious assignment anyway even tho I almost cried abt it bc I had a bad day. Anyway I guess seeing people more nervous than me and realizing that I’m not having bad thoughts about them aside from “oh they’re really nervous, this is hard for them even tho it’s not a big deal” kind of gets across that oh hey I should relax too bc it’s NOT a big deal. I feel like it’d prob print but if you did wanna change it i  sometimes I make her outfit lighter pink like those soft manga illustrations ~. people just love being rude like this con moved venues it's literally ONLY FIFTEEN MINUTES away from the previous venue and people are like "I'M NEVER GOING EVER AGAIN" and "THERE GOES ALL YOUR VENDORS" like lol ok bye better chances for me   . I understand if you have transportation issues that's one thing but I feel like people are just Mad..../vendors/ certainly weren't taking public transit. Hnn I understand :( It just seems wild to me for people to swear it off forever bc of a move... It's yet to be seen, but I think they genuinely are just trying to make the best decision to not have to increase rates, limit attendance, have INDOOR vendor room, etc. like last year. Yeah the load in/out was very nice but yeah it was pretty packed in the lobby/halls and oh god I remember when they were like monitoring the elevators so people didn't share rooms more than they were allowed to and it was just. Not Working. and then not letting people go into the vendors w/o a badge anymore too like idk anything about what happened but (softly) seems like new mgmt was kinda douchey. honestly I....I don't really love Manchester and Chelmsford sorta has a similar vibe for me like 'hey we have everything but its kinda shitty around here' LMFAOO. but I get what you're saying about hs/college age people. well, only time will tell. like we drive by where this hotel is and i'll admit it's kinda nowheresville right there aside from like, a pizza place, but there's a lot in a 10 min radius for those who drive/uber. yeah..I think like, in summation, it's definitely not *better* in general, but its probably the best option they had. omg this is one hell of a catchphrase
drumhill rd area is v busy but that's not where the con is LMFAOOO
It's about a 10 minute walk from downtown tho so you can walk around and theres local restaurants and stuff, you just have to walk /to/ the part to walk around.. and I mean downtown chelmsford is like.......uh....let's go with quaint pic.twitter.com/CAdeppElQU. just like, super outdated but some solid restaurants like Nobo, Fish Bones,....there's a Bertuccis i mean idk it's..Fine......... SORRY FOR ALL THE NOTIFS U TWO. hnn yeah I guess they'll probably see how it goes. I hate to think of them bouncing around wayward for a few years but sometimes it takes some trial and error. LMFAO WEll then you came to the right place
I can also recommend downtown Ipswich, where there's a whole store dedicated to Clogs. I second this!! The big 3 are pretty popular!! Woah!! It’s rad that your school has an event like that! I hope you get the $$$ to make your dreams come true, you two are already cranking out great work so I can only imagine what shenanigans you’d get up to! . Damn this AI contreversary is opening my eyes a bit to this nonsense. My school is >75% ladies so I don’t notice this sort of thing in that setting. Me: what’s your MOQ? 
Rep: so how many do you want?
Me: ...... LMFAOO I FORGOT I PUT YUT-LUNG ON MY DOOR HANDLE

YOU DONT. relatable..I got my permit and let it expire (2 years) without learning to drive so I'll have to get it again.. orz. Not exactly what you’re talking about, but it reminded me of an interesting thing I learned in color theory! The shadow cast by an object is the complement to the color of the light !! For example, shining a red light on an object creates a greenish shadow! Tfw you’re next in line to meet the band and you get kicked out bc it’s the venue’s curfew . It was the same as the merch line (TERRIBLE system) + I was not mentally prepared to meet them but when we were next + the opportunity was taken away it was sad af  At least they let me buy a shirt tho, I think the time I waited in that damn line was equivalent to the concert.

I've only ever seen one or two peeps w/ them but I think people would def send letters and stuff to artists they admire/friendos if it was a Thing, yknow? I would!

I didn’t know this was a thing and now I don’t know how to describe myself in any other way. I admire you bc your tweets are always so positive and hopeful - but at the same time, you don't put up a front, and when days are Bad, like today, you're honest about it and don't try to push it down . Aaand let's see. Little things..like if I'm walking outside and there's a bird or a bunny or even a little mouse really near I get so happy to see them and say hello!   Lately there's a cool owl who hangs out here and we just stare at each other. I've seen him 4 or 5 times now. ohmy GOD I forgot it was MOBDAY. guess who read a chunk of the manga a couple years back and forgot the absolute shit mob is about to endure isrhgfh. me, before inevitably dropping a class: gee look at all the credits I could be getting. dsfgdhgh i've been stressing for like a week about what to do about these classes...i love my brother very much and he's always encouraging me to try new things and push myself so I know when even he's like 'jenn don't do that' that I should REALLY not feel guilty but..still. me: sdfgdh This prof is so intimidating..
mom: Didn't you do well in her class before?
me: It wasn't a studio class. I took tests. I'm good at taking tests. Omg my brain is so ?!? 
My hair dresser who I’ve been going to for like..shit idk 10 years? is switching salons. It’s a similar distance, i can still go to her, etc but I just keep thinking about it lmfao It’s just so odd..it was a long term consistent thing that suddenly changed. Honestly I want new Bo Peep’s jumpsuit so badly . Someone make this cosplay so I can literally just buy it and wear it every day. Contest: Results on or before January 30th!

Also Todoroki cuddles and middle school MiriTama pic.twitter.com/TArthEkpqh. me: oh I left my mac n cheese in the fridge at school. I'll get it tomorrow.
mom: is that safe? would anyone mess around with it?
me: oh my god, no one's died yet, mom
mom: so what, you wanna be the first?
me: . aaa Cade and I went out in the snow and while I was kneeling and toweling her off, she reached her head back and licked the snow off my hat! 
It was so cute..Mutual grooming....or just thirsty  Either way..cute. she's paranoid. it can waste perfectly good mac n cheese. more like rat poison. did I already post about this song????
probably? 
am I gonna do it again?
yes.
Honestly. This is a HIT. https://www. youtube.com/watch?v=ob2uHI iW3II   …. What the fuck?! I’m so sorry this happened to you..Are you able to change classes? 
Regardless of what your teach thinks, I and many others adore your artwork! Guh. Woke up drooling..wish I could’ve continued tho Zzzz. OH NO I LOVE THIS. I almost got off the right train just now bc I almost got on the wrong train this morning . Ohh my prof finally got back to me, some of my cards sold at that local shop! . Ah wow competitors really upped their game this year so I didn’t win that contest   I’ll post the full finished design later today then.. I wonder if I can edit it to be different from their mascots cause I think it’d be a cute mug design imo. Not gonna lie I’m pretty bummed out. But the winners made some really solid work, they def deserve it!! Big 2019 Mood. ( Also I’m sorry :( ). Welp! Here was one of my entries for @Zenkaikon  's design contest! 
I didn't win, but I still think it's pretty cute and I had fun with the whimsical design.    Congrats to the winners!

Luckily, I already got into the Artist Alley, so I'll still see y'all there this Spring!  pic.twitter.com/mPdqjF8t69. Aaa Thank you!  
Hnn yeah, the use of the mascots + logo was only allowed for the contest, but I was thinking with some editing it'd make a cute mug or smth!  
The con is still a ways off, but I'll post my table number when I have it! :). OH for reference the theme this year was Lucky 13: Fortunes + Superstitions . I see Foxconn is in the news, having changed the plans to build a factory (+ create jobs) in WI.. If you want the story from the start, from the townspeople's perspective, PLEASE listen to  http:// gimletmedia.com/reply-all/132- negative-mount-pleasant   …. If you're not angry + disillusioned about the power of the people then gee do I have the episode for you--. i'm at the point of tired where all i can do is say 'i'm tired' over and over again. idk if i'm hungry or i'm just so tired that i'm trying to /eat/ energy. LMFAO YOU'RE NOT WRONG I just meant that I'm just trying to replace sleep with food which is not A Thing You Can Do. JESUSJDNDJSBDN the fucking fucking alert thing.....SO LOUD.....I KNOW We are expecting squalls now I also had a fucking heart attack djdndjdnndfjfjxnd. hmm ok I continue to have 0 ideas for content for this book but *if* i choose to go with this format then it'll get bigger as you page thru it so ..maybe something..that grows.........????? /lays down. uh ok twitter, brainstorming
things that grow
babies / animals / bugs
plants / forests
collections???
.
could also get conceptual like
love or hatred or ambition 
..
or could be like .......something that's obscured when cropped small getting clearer as your view becomes larger? we all love hair down kiri, but where's the hair down shinsou content?? Does his hair /go/ down????? When i was younger I want a black cat w green eyes and I wanted to name him Martini. me: i'm done spending money
goodsmile: ash nendo
me: fuck. I think it was just bc of the lack of design/relevancy to her/song?(+they didn't even write 'next') 
I think it's relevant to you (and your audience) so I don't see any problem, but I acknowledge that my opinion isn't the one that matters here! It's always good to dive deep! omg wait do you not pay right away? i don't think i've ordered thru goodsmile before! :O

AND I FEEL GUILTY..my poor yuuri nendo is still in his box bc i got him when I moved forever agosdghditg. ohh there's a special base if you order thru animate... Damn I had a dream they animated this book and it was in theaters now :( but also it was completely different. Seconded! ((It’s been a few years since I’ve ordered their stickers but I found them to be quite thin)). I have no motivation to leave my bed bc it’s sunny but it’s also 8 feels like negative 8 so. I didn’t make one of those stay warm stay safe posts but seriously - people are dying. If you have the luxury to then please stay the fuck inside. P*rtcon? Then yes bc my reminder says the first. They should acknowledge that it’s been changed otherwise people will get confused and may spend some time before they see the date changed Djfndjdn. LRT LMFAOO I. I need kiribaku art (or kiri anyone really) abt the cat boy post  but I don’t wanna makebit. Trying to avoid getting sick is difficult. For example, when I came in, someone was talking about how they were starting to get sick. I cleverly avoided sitting next to her and took the other seat. A few minutes later the girl next to me sniffled and said, “Sorry, I’m sick.”. do you think it's ok to wait to order both? do these things sell out or not really bc it's preorder? heh i made some cute animal totes for Advanced Surface Design. They're fake W/WF merch bc my prof said their merch is so ugly and feels like it hasn't been touched since 2000   She's not wrong..
Will post soon~ I low key wanna screen print the polar bear one for myself. I’m not counting this option out just yet. Eep! You’re eighth..I’ll email ya. I literally lost count of how many people I’ve seen having issues with them, or warning me against using them :( I’m sorry you had a bad experience.. ME TOO FRIEND!! I’ve heard they can be really flippant w customer service . Hiro! I was thinking about drawing him and in like, a Tiger patterned romper(?) with Kisa is something fluffy/sheep themed!
Hbu? MERU I GOT EXCITED BEFORE I READ THE “PLEASE”
TAKE RESPONSIBILITY . My mom used to say Cady was my dog but some months ago her loyalty switched to my mom and she always hangs off her and never me anymore. Yet when it’s time for a walk she stares and complains@me   Cady you’re just using meeeee. Sometimes when I don’t feel good I try to apply some yoga/mindfulness techniques from class but it’s really hard to present in my body when my body is in pain..if that makes sense. Omg .. such well-rounded activities! You’re busy! last min merch making is awful bc it's like 50/50 if u use up all your energy to make smth and then no one wants it and you've devastated OR you don't make it but turns out EVERYONE would've wanted it and if you miss out on making $$$  
Best of luck, but take care of yourself! wow   i just reread this LMFAO sorry for the typos, my head hurts;;. Aaah yeah I totally get it!! You need to save up some energy reserves for the actual /con/ yknow!! So start with the most popular/fun and just do what ya can but don't lose sleep!! <3 
Thank you friend, wish I was seeing ya there!! I'm sure our paths will cross again soon~. LRT gosh all these red envelopes are so beautiful but either I follow every single artist in this show or theres like A BILLION OF THEM omg I can't wait to see pics..I hope there's one of the whole lot of them!! ahah easier said than done though, right?
aaa yes that sounds fun!! Y'all going to Zenkai or AX? That's all I have lined up;; . LRT The interview part of the show only gets this deep occasionally but I was tearing up at this last night..Even before this part, when she was talking about the misogyny and homophobia she faced it was just..you could see on her face that she's been through itdfgdh. gotta do what you gotta do;; I know the incredibly antsy losing your mind feeling but resting is super important to avoid worse/longer term problems with your arm/hand! You'll get through it and get back to creating in no time! :). lmfaoo AN*rth has such wild rules, they now allow acrylic keychains but, and I quote, "Acrylic Standees are not permitted for sale and will be confiscated if any stock is present at the convention." ..THAT's..SO ARBITRARY AND LIKE..THEY'LL BE../cONFISCATED/ ohmygod. Ah, have you been there before? They break up their alley..I think there is or used to be even more categories but the 'comic market' used to be only paper (prints, books, PAPER stickers) but now they allow vinyl stickers and acrylic keychains..but not stands still? it's silly af. omg wait really? D: I've never been to that part of Canada so I wanted to go;;. OOF...................I think I got off the waitlist last year but I didn't go bc I had Momo...which I didn't get into this year /lays down Here's to hoping for Animazement? checks 2019 con spreadsheet again only to see that nope, nothing has changed u fool. I got in last year but I had momo and my attempts at having a proxy seller which is allowed there went Poorly;; Hopefully they won't hold it against me..
omg Yes I only did one Canadian con - Otakuthon in like 2015? 16? - and the Canadian dollar really screws ya! SERIOUSLY............ pic.twitter.com/8XDHUhYybW. y'all know I'm here for another ship but Ground Zero and Zero Gravity would be pretty cute matching hero name for Bakugou and Uraraka. I literally almost forgot about zine leftovers tomorrow. I Knew I was forgetting 1 thing I just couldn't figure out what it was until just now omg. red-eyed iida is 7000x more interesting somehow. dfghrt oh no.. you're the second person to say they treat artists badly;;  > n<. hnnn i've heard mixed things now so I'm gonna apply still and we'll see what happens i guess.. aa If I do get it it may just turn into a family trip but i'll let ya know! Good luck to us both!! . Here's some polar tote mockups I created for Advanced Surface Design! 
The assignment was to design merch for @WWF ! (Removed branding to post)

Unfortunately I am not associated with them, but they're doing great work so please consider donating or 'adopting' an animal! pic.twitter.com/oIGh93vSue. AA THANK YOU ANDY.. It's not out of the question - I designed them with screen printing in mind - but I wouldn't be able to get those pretty colors/different strap colors on my own;; I want the bear tho..I ...want...the BEAR ....LMFAOO . THANK YOU DANI   Y'all are too kind.. It's not out of the question- I designed them with screenprinting in mind -but I wouldn't be able to get those pretty colors/different strap colors on my own..If I pay the $$$ to use the studio this semester tho i'll be making some version~. My cursed deku kewpie will be here tomorrow I’m so excited ... THAT’S ONE HELL OF A REASON. I’m so glad everyone is safe and I hope it can be resolved as quickly as possible.  thank you so much Dani!! I’ll def post when I get the chance to make em! Fun Fact: No one in the history of the world has ever read a full Dr. Bronner’s label. Ndjshdjss omg everyone wants the one thing idk how to make   BUT THANK YOU  looks like I’ll try to screen print a version of these sometime! I’m just worried it’ll be disappointing since I’m not sure I can achieve the exact colors+diff strap colors on my own . Me@w/wf hire me u cowards, my dear friends want the bags. So happy to hear it!!! I’m looking forward to seeing what y’all create! Well. I saw an ad for a razor on Instagram and bc I apparently have nothing else to do I clicked on the comments where a guy was like “who shaves their toes?!” And a lot of women replied “us” and I clicked on his profile and his bio says “straightedge daddy” and I. Me: I want the polar bear
Prof: Polar bears are so overdone. The arctic hare is much more unique.
Me: I want ...the polar bear. HE!!!! pic.twitter.com/4ON2ETiHCE. ((BUT THANK YOU SO MUCH  )).  aa Thank you Morgana!! PS I never made it by the shop to drop off the banana fish buttons from a long while ago! Could you DM me your address so I can mail them :O. Thank you so much!! I was a bit worried bc I know polar bears and whales have been done by /everyone/ but I'm really happy with how they turned out   I'll def post here about the making situation once I figure it out! Djdjdjdj Thank you Jess  I’m glad they’re so well received! PS I think I saw before that you got into AB? Congrats! I wanted to say thank you again for ANYC and lemme know if u need anything! I don’t live super near the con (45/an hour) but I’ll  do what I can! :). Ok since there’s been a good amount of interest - I’ve been looking into make a version of these. So here’s two polls - one for color, one for design (See OP). Design Poll (See OP).  ahddjd thank you lani! I’m dyin bc I found almost perfect color totes to print on but they’re $$$. IDJDBFNKDDNSJWOLQNAANDY. You should make a mini zine about this shit tbh. Bet you wish YOUR Bakugou Nitotan had a dimple and a baby tee  pic.twitter.com/qk2tyugg7x. @ chriseatscandy  defective nitotan crew. I love this Defective Boy. wahh the kids on this street are all so athletic they make me feel like i didn't live my life to the fullest in my youth lmfao. lmfao I'm ok with him, I think it's very funny. I'm more concerned about your kuro bc of his mouth,..stitching is so tricky, one wrong move and everything goes to hell D:. hnn honestly with their history being persistent may be a better route > A<  Good luck friend!! . Aaaa how exciting!! It's so cute!! > u< A perfect fit~. W h a t
Ok look I hate soup. I HATE soup. I really really Hate soup.
But I will eat chicken noodle soup. My very Jewish grandmother insisted that it cures colds and she wasn't /totally/ wrong: https:// share.upmc.com/2014/02/chicke n-noodle-soup-when-sick/   …. If you try it and it's not good ya gotta try at least one other. I just had it twice from the same place and once it was SOOO AMAZING and the other it tasted like celery and the chicken was somehow dry even while being /in soup/ so give it a couple goes \o/. idk why i'm always shocked when kiri zines sell like hotcakes
LAST BATCH@10 PM EST
i'll be soo happy to finally wrap this project up!! ohh!! I couldn't remember where you were! Hnn yeah there's so many things to do with chicken, I guess other dishes are just way more popular there :O I wonder if you'd have to find some specialty place or it just isn't a thing.. making a quick slideshow about like uh naive(?) ceramics for class! like childish illustrations on clay.. feel free to send me artists if you know what the fuck i'm talking about. LMFAO I keep remembering people but not knowing their usernames 
i'm only missing two hmhm. https:// docs.google.com/presentation/d /13y0Je_sbM7DTBDwk9ustUaRgaasIv_3_Ydz7ls8JwUc/edit?usp=sharing   …  In case you want some people to follow ;)
((Note: Not sure if first two on first panel are ceramic or paper/other clay)). THANK YOU NIE!! 
LATELY I FEEL LIKE IDK WHAT I'M DOING.. but I like it and people like it, so I'm glad. ok my mom has been complaining for almost a year that we don't get all the channels we pay for (also worth noting that we barely watch cable tv and probably shouldn't be paying for ANY channels---) and she's finally gonna go check so it's the moment of truth. (so far we have them all)
mom: the problem is these are not the channels I want
me: but they're the channels you deserve --- I'M SORRY YOU SET ME UP FOR THAT. Cuddlebug!!! pic.twitter.com/Y4td8iqbH9. Call out post for myself for laying in bed all fucking day lately. Anxiety I’m used to but I need stop this whole Depression thing fuck. I had a dream I was gonna redraw a funny meme with Shorter and Ash but idk what the meme said :(. It was something about dressing sexy ..it was my subconscious so it’s probably nonsense or not funny but I still wish I could remember. i'll be looking@notes with merch requests and meeting those but otherwise kiri zine people you're gonna get what ya get, it's based on absolutely nothing how many pieces you get, I'm just throwing it in lmfao. also unfortunately it is somewhat limited by us/international bc the international ones cannot go over 8 oz or it costs ~$10 more to ship so (Scream emoji). So cute!!  I hope you’re having a lovely birthday. Me: applies to two zines
Me: gets into two zines
Me: what the fuck. This isn’t a brag it’s a statistical anomaly. Lmfao   Thank you! I’m happy but..MORE THINGS TO DO haha the constant struggle. LRT holy shit gimmeeeeeee. big dumbass energy. i thought my phone was in my vertical pocket so I let go. spoiler alert: it wasn't. mom: maybe only the protector is cracked and its fine underneath
me: ....maybe
mom: uhh are those lines supposed to be on the screen?
me: ..............................fuck. Rest in pieces pic.twitter.com/foTWJ2JfhD. pic.twitter.com/k0N3kFRr7v. WELP TIME TO DROP A COOL HUNDO ON A NEW PHONE (thanks, insurance?)...bye bye local gift shop chanukah card money . . . . orz. my fault for multitasking > A<. I HAD A CASE but I took it off bc I took it off bc I didn't want my professor to comment on how it was my art from last semester
social anxiety wins yet again (shakes fist at cloud). aaa thank you;; its bc my phone is old I had to get a different kind of case that wasn't as nice a design as the ones i'm selling so i didn't want crit on it LMFAOO
Yes indeed. I hope they're out of my phone cause it's so old + they give me smth newer w the same GB lmfao. lrt I don't want it to be but it is funny to picture the future w wonder duo pro heroes deku and kacchan like being introduced as these cutesy nicknames when interviewed on a variety show or the celebrity guest on like sesame street or smth LMFAOO. pic.twitter.com/FADsIeNamE. gosh this is my first time mailing a lot of stuff since the usps rate changes and it's painful. i got so distracted by my phone and kiri zines that i forgot about the football
also bc i don't care about the football. I'm watching the puppy bowl and omg they had a (small) cruise w shelter dogs and potential adopters but like...do you think any pups get sea sick? ahaha Thank you! \o/. this has been an emotional rollercoaster. LRT waahh piercings are so cool!!! too bad I'm a scaredy-cat who can't be bothered with extra maintenance .. oh wow all the s3 episode descriptions were leaked for ladybug!! :O I'm gonna be good and not look at them tho!! ..at least not yet haha. YEP! That's exactly how it goes my friend. I just.. the past year or so I've been really selective w my applications so......why two at once orz. ahh yeah it's our own faults LMFAO "I LOVE THIS THING ILL APPLY" (Gets the thing) "OH NO???". my mom is exasperated with me bc I asked her literally when we got up today if she could not wait until I was trying to go to bed to take a shower (bc my bed is directly over the pump) and it's past midnight and she still hasn't showered and just told me that i'm 'rushing her'. Well the composition is a mess so I’ll probably have to scrap it but at least I figured out a potential color palette...big sigh. Me all week: Monday I’m gonna get up early and go to the beach w my dog and relax and eat good food
Me upon waking: (lays in bed for an hour) ugh. pic.twitter.com/nVrQZW3xdr. We’re doing it just should’ve gotten my butt up sooner :( it’s ridiculously nice. Ok we’re going pic.twitter.com/BVitJvwgxW. Thank you Chris!! Her face  pic.twitter.com/evnwkcaINc. New career pet photographer pic.twitter.com/rVrAkbVdPn. I knew Cady was a mix but I didn’t know she was part ostrich pic.twitter.com/VqCSvyqCBw. Got to photograph my new enamel pin at the beach! I’m in love with this..

You can get one at  http:// cambrasine.art/shop-all     pic.twitter.com/Zw7Ovmr4GD.  aaa thank you  !!  thank you zambi. HOLY SHIT I forgot that I didn't download gmail on my temporary phone and wow is this how many emails I get. me: time to fill out my AX form!
me: (opens it)
me: nevermind. aa thank you Tania!! Your merch is always so gorgeous so this means a lot . lrt i put other peoples litter in my pockets to throw out > n< This road is a mess! OHH IM STILL NOT USED TO MOB MONDAYS I KEEP FORGET. HONESTLY IM SCARED TO WATCH IT I know I read this part but uh it's gonna be intense right? and..the dog? right? I HAD THIS SAME EXPERIENCE. Mmmmmmm,...................something caught onto it inside the package tho? I post my entire life on twitter but as soon as I think of making a zine That feels really personal to me I feel just so Embarrassed?! It took several days to build myself up to show my mom and I gotta present to a class of strangers and a prof I’m intimidated by tomorrow? Idk.. If it was snagged on smth else inside the packaging then it’s their fault for not wrapping them better? Also I agree I don’t think it was that..like how can they definitively say it wasn’t that way they must send tons of orders? I like when places have that “this package was checked by (signature)” thing ..but like I’m sure I don’t send nearly as many packages as them and if someone said hey this thing is defective I’d be like oh yeah it probably was defective or I didn’t wrap it well. Sometimes postal services fuck up I just think this isn’t one of those times. Hnnn yeah that’s definitely it. I got better at this in general but it’s diff when your work is like smth outside of yourself like animals or characters or pattern or whatever vs something about feelings/mental health struggles/etc. CAUSE THEY're COOL AF. LMFAOO LOOK AT MY LAST FEW POSTS FRIEND. functionality doesn't matter - most people just put their pins on boards anyway - THEY ARE SO WELL DESIGNED!! I found that like two months ago btw. arsfdfghh aa thank you lisa!! . ahaha honestly..i'm the same way. I've got one or two on a bag or sweatshirt but mostly cork board!! SDGDH THANK YOU...aaa yes my friend got the good good manus ahah   Yess, the gold worked out really well, I'm very happy!! pic.twitter.com/W0p6gzquWG. i ate too many tacos
i'm too full to go to sleep
im ade
a mistak
e. also they were supposed to be lunch for tomorrow so i made
2 mistake. THIS WEEKS MP100 WAS FUCKING GORGEOUS BTW
Someone said movie quality and they were NOT lying my goodness
but uh
wasn't there like???
a scene where they killed a dog?? 
am I misremembering or was it cut? I thought it was in the last preview... WAIT IT WAS THE CAT ..and yeah they just breezed over that , oh well. i don't now but i did then. do you think they spent the whole budget on the OP and episode 5 and the whole rest of the season will be like still frames
i'd b ok w that. i'm cryin i just wanna go to bed but i keep printing this thing the wrong way and i dont know i did it wrong til it's folded bc i'm not good at this. Some people that make anime/chibi style figures from clay are so ridiculously skilled and like i want one but 1. idk what of and 2. i'm So scared to even guess how much it costs. fun fact about me i've been trying to decide on a color for my Big 3 ita bag for like a whole ass year. Thank you so much Jinja!! My goodness! Thank you everyone for your kind comments/likes/RTs   I’m proud of it, so I’m glad this design is always so well received!! pic.twitter.com/AMMKokQkuj. I’m not familiar enough w the market to have an opinion. Very bold. Trying to imagine the ao3 tags for this promo.. Idndhahabdjsishs out of our huge class my prof talked to me Last - 10 minutes over time so I didn’t get to go outside at all and I don’t have enough time to eat before my NEXT 4 hour class!! Fun!!! I know it was fun fun happy football parade day but pls refrain from blasting music on public transit 
Esp when it’s like fucking bedtime for people who had shit to do today my dude zzzzz. Oh. My. God. I’m hyped . The only good thing about a headache is I can eat chocolate without fear bc I already have a headache. Never in my life have I wanted to just drop everything and draw smth like I do for the banana fish valentines outfits. I started feeling really bad before bed and downed some aleve cause my head hurt so badly and now I’m awake and the pain is gone but I can so tell it’s artificially suppressed and somehow feel gross still. I had a dream where my prof was advising me on paper choices and my subconscious like completely perfectly replicated her, good job brain 
It also made a good point about choosing a redder toned paper if I do blue for the spot color to create more contrast . Let honestly how would this not completely fuck you up. Me: ready to fall back asleep and try to fit in one more hour of sleep before school 
Trash trucks: BEEP BEEP bitch u forgot about us. twitter u ever have  a kink and you're just like 'i don't think there's a word/term for this'? . IM JUST SAYING I DONT THI/nk therES A WORD
ITS NOT LIKE CRAZY WEIRD OR ANYTHING I JUST WOULDNT KNOW HOW TO DESCRIBE IN LESS THAN LIKE 12 WORDS. ahahah true true but that one seems really simple! i dont drink/smoke but this is a 'second night of 5 hours of sleep' tweet
I can't function under 6.5 hrs so my inhibitions are Lowered bc i'm half asleep. at the library and this person is deadass painting her nails next to me i gotta move lest i be asphyxiated 
SHE'S GOT A WHOLE SET UP TOO ITS NOT LIKE ONE COLOR. I'LL DM U ITS NOT THAT WEIRD I THINK. ITS DEFINITELY NOT THE DEEPEST DARKEST ONE LMFAOO. vague tweeting abt kinks and not doing my hw
welcome to my new brand
fuck i'm tired. slides into ur dms. oh fuck i should go get lunch. brain: eat smth healthy and avoid fried foods
mouth: can i have chicken fingers please. I think that’s a different kink. Omg that’s amazing!! I’m sure you worked hard!!  do we get to see or not? . I made the executive decision to take a nap even tho it was a stupid time and honestly i woke up to warm and in a puddle of drool but that was the best sleep I’ve had since right before school started back up. I DID HAVE WEIRD DREAMS THO in one, someone I follow had posted like endless sets of furry porn and I kept trying to get it off my screen but I was fumbling so bad out of shock that I clicked on like 6 of them . He looks like he’s made of velvet. HEJGHEBDBSNDNDNF THIS IS THE FUNNIEST THING IVE SEEN IN A WHILE holyshit. This was a good call tho bc I was just radiating tired dumbass energy. Last night in class I drank water, spilled it all over myself, continued drinking and spilling. This morning I tried to put a seatbelt on on the commuter rail, took earplugs on my walk instead of glasses, etc. DHFNFHSIDJFJOHMYGOD. Idc what the actual results are you win Rui. Ohh it looks nice tho! You could try a color depositing conditioner like overtone to tint it? Taking reference photos is such a pain in the dick why can’t we all just have live models we pose and dress up like the good ole days. The next assignment is to design a food truck which I was dreading but the key to school is to make assignments into what you wanna draw so I’m redesigning my ice cream mermaid and giving her some sweet frozen treat friends \o/. Prof: design a truck and plates, napkins, etc.
Me : (designs characters and a repeat pattern) 
Me: did I do the thing. LMFAO hardcore branding !! This is some high budget shit apparently . Also crowdsourcing ideas for more foods for the hypothetical truck. I think it’s reasonable to have a limited menu but just in case something fits well.. I was doing Japanese frozen treats/festival food - taiyaki ice cream, frozen bananas, mochi ice cream. Pretty much!! 
I was thinking I should keep the logo or pattern one color so it’s be cheaper to print but then I was like wait this is all fake ahhaha. also totally different project but any recs for toned paper that comes in 11 x 17 (or larger)? yeah!! silk screen!! I think I have to get samples anyways bc it has to be folded into eighths;;. Yess!! I think green will be a major color bc of the matcha  I have dango!! I’ll have to look up anmitsu! . she gets a redesign! taiyaki tail and less skin showing for more general appeal  pic.twitter.com/ePocuqXLIv. But wait —- she’s evolving! 
.

 pic.twitter.com/SQhYkkC00i. I write on Insta but I’ll add here that these designs are so effective bc if you take a minute to look for clues you can discern who’s what but they don’t like hit you over the head with it. It’s GREAT. I’m not in this fandom but you drew her so cute and soft looking!! does anyone else feel like some artist’s style went through an awkward teen phase? Like the early drawings are super generic anime or even exactly copying a certain series’ style, then they break away from that and start to individualize but it’s clunky, THEN it matures to smth? I hope this doesn’t come off like I’m belittling more “generic” styles I’m def not it’s just like you start from copying smth and then develop your little methods and quirks and choices as you go? Yeah! I thought I worded it ok, I just wanted to cover my ass before anyone misunderstood and yelled at me bc yknow,,,, internet . Omg I remember drawing off front facing noses like Bisco Hatori for a while. shfjfdidj this is sooo true! I remember being so excited to get my shoujo Chris Hart book. Yeah!! I think it's fine to have clear influences too, but like you said it's branching off of that. Like your coloring is super soft and painty I feel like! And you're really consistent too! I feel like I'm throwing darts at the wall w style lately LMFAOO. aaa I'm so glad it arrived to you safely! wasedrftghjkl;'. YOU'RE too kind saying all that TT A TT . I'm not there yet in life but I feel like so many people get comfortable in their job (whether they hate it or love it) and honestly I admire so much how brave it is of you to go off and pursue your passion!!   I'm rooting for you!! OHMygod this is accurate...one of my teachers literally referred to me as the fashionista and trendsetter of my grade........wearing tutus and arm and leg warmers and bedazzled jeans and all that shit omg..what a dark period. Seriously they were so successful??? bc there was a market of us?? and no one else was making them (or in english at least?)????????? just good marketing?! a mystery. Omg haha maybe we all just feel that way about our own work . Yes! You’ll never know if you don’t try!!
Aaaaaa Morgana..thank you so much   well I’m very fortunate that I’m able to pursue art (in and out of school) without many other responsibilities..I know many others don’t have the luxury but still make it work yknow? ok i'm gonna make what i hope to be a realistic to do list today..send good vibes sregdthf. tryna decide if i should put one of the sea creatures on top of the truck or if that's fucking stupid LMFAO. lrt i'm not in this fandom cause i spook easy but these illustrations are lovely. can't believe the critique i received on my ice cream truck was more fucking ice creams thanks@my mom and @grimmfirefly. my mom found a LOT of old papers - including my second grade sketchbook. please enjoy this lilo & stitch oc pic.twitter.com/ZKyPWCuVNl. WHATHTEUFSREGFDh. LRT AaAAAAAAaAAAAAAaAAAAAAaAAAAAAaAAAAAAaAAAAAAaAAAAAAaAAAAAAaAAAAAAaAAAAAAaAAAAA. i fucking love him what the fuck
i'm always done spending $ then they make MORE THINGS..... put "yay, swiss!" on my gravestone
I don't even like swiss cheese. omg I didn't realize they actually have spaghetti legs...i've never seen such  a thing before and tbh........ i don't hate it . imagining their lil legs dangling off an ita bag............ lrts I desperately want all of them..imo they're the most attractive plush so far?? To me they're the best looking - spaghetti legs and all - and also look the softest to touch??? fuck. THEY RUn....... WAIT--- IMAGINE THEM HANGING FROM THE REARVIEW MIRROR IN  A CAR. LMFAOO YOu'LL DRIVE INTO A POLE BUT ITLL /be WORTH IT. guhh should i sell things??? I feel bad bc i just put out $ for the nendoroids......... > A<. hnn true, true,...I just feel guilty consuming so much dsghdfhfg I think I've been a little /too/ good to myself lately, yknow?

but...the spaghetti legs plushes TT A TT....the legs, korinne --- the  LEGS... I ONLY DID ONCE I SAW  THIS PHOTO LMFAOO 
Idk who did this but they deserve an award pic.twitter.com/pmSjxxlSR7. Omg I forgot about these things!! You’re so right . I don’t think going w someone else we’ve ever spent more than $40 on the two of us, including having leftovers and dessert.. That feels on brand . Ohmygod. i want all of the stupid spaghetti strings plush
i keep trying to pick just one or two but 
they're all really cute
and my soft spot for yut-lung is ever growing so now even he's not out of the running lmfaooo. you ever go to do smth you keep forgetting to do only to realize actually you Did do it?
weird. I forgot to post these! Keep them together or give one to your sweetheart or BFF to match! 

Get ‘em@ http:// cambrasine.art    and can ship immediately!  If you wanna send them directly to someone else, I can write a note for ya~ Write in the notes at checkout+be sure to sign! pic.twitter.com/mdBlneEtXd. Omg maybe for next year I should draw another boy and girl or non-binary characters so you can pick and choose..that’d b cuuteeee. Lrt honestly..cause that’d be the house of All Might . I didn’t even realize this was the dream but it Is. i make fun of my mom for keeping all her receipts and she just found one where they charged her for TWENTY two bagels instead of TWO lmfaoo. right?! I am kicking myself for not thinking of it sooner! bad, heteronormative brain! . My #artvsartist  #artvsartist2019  ! 
I decided not to focus on faces/humans and just *go for it* instead, so this is made completely of illustrations I've finished in the last 3 months!  pic.twitter.com/wctiE8FR5A. [DO NOT RT] For comparison, here's my last one from 2016...guhhh......it's really been a while huh?! pic.twitter.com/vb7e2xN4yz. ITS SERIOUSLY GREATT. Me, trying to justify buying spaghetti legs plush: they’ll be released around my birthday....
. Did I ghostwrite this. Imagine if school was cancelled on Tuesday holy shit please
And yes I’m aware it’s only 4 weeks into the semester . I don’t think so, it’s just 9 squares. Could probably use an instagram phone photo collage app if u wanted! LRT everyone please start drawing Bakugou w headbands this is a good look omg. Quick Shinsou doodle for you!!  We hope you feel better soon! pic.twitter.com/DsNd7FvGnv. Yessss! I’ve seen headband Deku and Kiri before but not Bakugou :O. For all your Shinsou needs  pic.twitter.com/qz72juMrMX. This place sounds magical. 2019 sure is a year, pic.twitter.com/vhtIP10Jrn. awa sucks tho doesn't it. it was my understanding that everyone does badly at awa and p good at momo. idk if it's like. worth it. but i'll apply... for momo I always get waitlisted then get in off the waitlist but this year they said you're high on the waitlist BUT WE DONT EXPECT TO GET OFF IT and i died a little bit honestly..I had so much fun there last year :( I WANTED TO GO BACK AND RUN THRU THE FOUNTAIN. idk if that's really saying smth positive about the con or just saying smth negative about the rest LMFAO. Nope!   
KEY: Green - Accepted, Yellow - Waiting to Hear, Orange - Waitlist, Red - Rejected...and Grey messed up and didn't apply haha. adfsh Thank you!! <3 
wheeze yeah..I'm gonna try for day-of tables for AB..precious home con TT A TT
I'm waiting on AnimeNEXT (NJ) and Animazement (NC), and there's some apps for later in the year that haven't opened yet but > n<;; ITS NOT LOOKIN GOOD.. different? how so? :o
I have family an hour outside of Atlanta, but not that I can stay with so I don't know that it would be worth it tbh; Ohh, I've never been to Youma before, but I'll apply! Aa I've been applying to magfest for like four years now and I never get in   Maybe someday!! I'm glad you had fun though, and it's good to know that too!! u ever log on to do your hw then draw asheiji. this is gonna be cute if i 1, have time to finish it 2. finish it. (figuring out plans)
me: I need time to do my hw!! I could do it tonight but.. I just stared drawing asheiji (shows)
mom: OHHH, IT'S VERY CUTE THOUGH... Whatever they are, they’re super cute !!! I love the shoulder thingies of the one on the left. Tfw there’s so many possible causes of your headache that you’re not sure what to do to fix it . ash continues to be 1000x harder for me to draw than eiji..u little fucker. Valumtimes drawing. Let me w flight anxiety. Every time I watched the movie I was so distracted when the giant owl mascot (costume) was just like flapping his wings or smth on screen. I updated my website banner...she's so cute...can u tell i love her. Alright! Thanks y’all ! Me too!! More than that tho I’m annoyed that even first class packages are by zone now - on the platforms that don’t let you go by the address I have to assume they live far and possibly overcharge people or lose $ guh. I almost cried 3 times AND Actually cried watching I Want to Eat Your Pancreas   I’d recommend it.. LMFao NO ITS NOT WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE ITS JUST SAD AF Like A Silent Voice/Koe no Katachi but I liked this better. Seriously I said to my friend “I think it was supposed to make me want to go out and live life to the fullest but I kinda just wanna go home, crawl in bed, and cry”. *almost cried 3 times and DID cry 3 additional times 
I fucked up the main point of my tweet. I HAVENT SEEN EITHER I’d say the closest thing I’ve experienced was Your Lie in April. If you’re like wtf is this please go look it up cause i really enjoyed it! If you liked Your Lie in April it’s probably up your alley . I bruised my hand w my backpack strap like 5 days ago and it’s still there :|. YES..IT WAS VERY GOOD.. We had to go to the dub bc of my friend's schedule but I hope to watch it in Japanese when I can. Ahh, isn't that always the case! I'll add it to my never-ending list haha 
Ahh, yeah, everyone I told the title to was like wtf?! but it's a beautiful film! @ grimmfirefly. omg the interviw portion before the film like...it was so odd to see the difference in the way the English and Japanese VAs talked about the film?? Like the Japanese actors were literally crying and the English ones were joking around more. even tho I'm often feeling like I'm not getting anywhere it's worth acknowledging that my younger self would be really impressed that I have purple hair and go to art college tbh. aaa yes Ria! It's hard to remember, but it kinda just suddenly popped into my head a moment ago. It feels so impossible to imagine where we'll be in a year, or five, or ten but ..just gotta keep going and find out I suppose! <3. I thought I read he was 18 but I don't know that that's true at all. meanwhile eiji over here, not even have a fucking birth date. maybe she just knows we want to know and wants us to suffer
the only explanation for ash's death too SRghdirfythjg. i know i already tweeted this but gee whiz i sure do want school to be cancelled this week (tues/wed). You ever try to scan smth from your sketchbook but you leave the ribbon bookmark in when you do. Lrt it’s my first valentines single since I was 1 4 ?! ..holy shit what is life 
ANYWAY Being alone can make ya lonely, but I’ll be eating cake w a friend and posting a cute banana fish draw! If it bums you out then do smth you enjoy!! FILL THE VOID LMFAOO. Ohh look at us, is this growing up?   Thank you so much for the good vibes, I’ll send you love too! Shdhshdhdh THANK YOU SO MUCH, NIE!! LOVE FLYING IN BOTH DIRECTIONS . WAIT SINCE I WAS 15 BC MARCH COMES AFTER FEBRUARY ITS 3 am goodnight. I think it’s hardwired in our brain since we were young to be attached to plush . RT cause I know I have a lot of Filipina mutuals! Aaaa no mob for me til tonight aaaaaaaaaa. Oh my god?! That’s wild... either send nothing or write a few nice lines and mass mail them, going in between seems ruder somehow lmfao. THIS IS SO FUCKING CUTEREEEEEEENFNDJD. LRT y’all best keep your eyes on this Kickstarter, it’s going to be . GAHH I DID THIS ONCE DURING BANANA FISH SEASON...I FEEL FOR YOU FRIEND..But Mob will be waiting for you when you get home . aaaa I watched mobbbbbbbbb I'm sooo nervous/excited for next week. i miss teru i wanna rewatch teru episodes. dHFHJGJHGDYHGDKFXHGFJtdjf. rsegrdg I started rewatching s1 and i'm on ep 3 but i'm like..should i skip one ep to teru LMFAO
HE'S A GOOD BOY AND IC ANT REMEMBER WHEN HE COMES BACK I want to see him. You are strong!! You’ll make it!! Soon!!! I don’t seem to b horny for reigen like apparently everyone I know??? but I’m happy for y’all, and that studio bones is feeding you well . pfffffheh 
I find when I’m trying to scale characters it is so much suffering bc some characters just have bigger hair and it makes everything look off. OHHH NANA!! HELLO!! Ahahha
No worries! You didn’t make me uncomfy!! I was just like “ohh they called me Jennie..did I forget who this is?” But then I figured that bc it’s in my twitter name it’s kinda fair game to anyone even if it is sorta familiar   Thanks for letting me know! It’s just really funny to see people pointing out how they made completely sexless scenes spicier . Aaaa im inconsistent with chibi proportions too /pat pat 
I find it’s when I’m drawing big(Kiri) or floofy(Deku) hair next to short/flat/straight hair (like Todo). JFHSUDBDHD HE WOULD THO 
Yeah he’s just so ridiculous I can’t separate the parts of him . Ahahha thank you!! It’s really funny seeing everyone yelling about mob in general on my dash every Monday, and like 80% of it is Reigen thirst tweets . Score! First class is cancelled. Second class the guy sent out a weird email but I’m not going either way..there were a lot of others who also commute 30 mins - 2 hours in that class so. What a fun metaphor for an absolutely terrible feeling omg
Headaches brought on by sleep deprivation should only be cured by sleep!! Please rest!! Y’all I’ve never been to L*berty C*ty Anime Con but it’s...small, isn’t it?! $500 is crazy for a table, right?! Or am I just losing it. my school is..Infruiating
I changed my password bc they make me change it once every few months, and now it's not letting me in with either my old password or my new one and i' m d/rsfGJHGJHGJ. @ chriseatscandy  @riasaur  y'all did this last year right? Yeah, it was. It's not this year tho. Uh...yeah...can I ask what it was before out of curiosity? I always forgot to apply to that con so of course I remember the year it's suddenly insane. GUH this prof is very cool but still so intimidating to me but i feel stuck so i had to email her gdfhggfjh. Cady was standing next to my screen like bitch take me outside, then as she walked away she pulled out my charging cord..what a power move. yesss second class officially cancelled tooo~~~ bye~~
tho it seemd like from his email he was gonna give us the assignment anyway but most of the students prob don't have the software on their own computers so??????????? hm. Update he was just like see u next week :) so guess he’s over the assignment?? HAHAH. Owww my body
It’s snowing so quickly. Lrt sobbing...ice cream mermaid in Rii’s style... I know?! It really does seem way bigger now? Maybe bc it aired on Toonami here...? lrt someone give me $100 so I can give it to r*ibrego. OP from ERASED  https://www. youtube.com/watch?v=Y9G20w V0KHE   …  and both MP100 OPs. y'all is backwarder out or not i can't find it :(. ohh looks like a couple more hours. oop yeah I thought it was like 300 so this makes sense..yikes. yeah but ...charging every artist $500 and $1000+ for each exhibitor..with that significant of an increase in table price I feel like they're just price gouging - there's no way their venue cost went up /that/ much, if it did at all. I'd consider splitting, but $250 will get you a full 6ft at most conventions, especially ones this small, so it still feels .....I don't wanna give them $500 on principle LMFAO. mom: she said the only thing we're not covered for is flooding
me: ah yes of course, and why would we ever worry about that with our house being on a lake. Yeah AB is way less than that, and even AX - which has ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE - was like $450 with *two* badges. yeah..locals AND willing to pay $500 is there only category of artists now..which is miserable bc it'll really limit the diversity of the alley :(. *ABLE and willing. hnn yeah I'm not gonna but I'm bummed out, I wanted to try it this year :( and it's so hard to get into cons this year that it's frustrating to have to cross another one off the list yknow? yeah?! and like, when I organize zines, there are always legitimately people I wish I could take but you never know how it'll sell so you can't commit to higher page counts plus the cost for merch and SHIPPING for each person..I can't imagine a rejection not acknowledging that.. hnn I'm really hoping the few local cons work out this year at least;; I applied to Ladies Con already, and I'll be applying to Pop Cult and the ~new location~ AAC which I really hope goes well since it's such a precious con to me and many others!! My 1st time tabling was there! IN CONCLUSION, I HOPE I CAN SEE Y'ALL..SOMETIME..SOMEWHERE................ i'm not being productive at all but i'm glad I started rewatch mp100 s1 bc I really needed to be reminded of everything!! yeah even the site still says 'sign up to be notified when it opens'
they just randomly sent it this afternoon........which is kinda shitty for a fcfs con...it's sold out even tho it's priced that way...a desperate year for AA haha. honestly what the hell this is SO GOOD..everythings so woven together. my bro used to pass on my anime suggestions bc *he doesn't watch tv* but he already watched all of russian doll so I called him out and said he's in the habit of it now so i'm tryna convince him to watch mp100. chocolate tower truffle cake from the Cheesecake Factory . “Fucking eat this” https:// twitter.com/thorpeta17/sta tus/1095023005707702277   …. Oh no!! I'm sorry :( It's the worst when you get excited for a snow day that doesn't happen...do you at least not have to shovel a lot of snow now ?;;. still curious to see when p*rtcon apps actually go up considering they changed the date to thursday feb 13th isn't an actual day this year . GUh..the MBTA can barely function when there /isn't/ snow.. "Your lucky charm seems more convoluted than usual.." - Actual quote from Backwarder. Hey friends! This has happened to me a couple times: If u ever notice I'm following someone who has a history of abuse, assault, etc., or any other of those ~ super fun qualities ~ please let me know so I can get the hell outta there!   Let's look out for each other! Thank you.  “Ring A Ding Ding, It's Abuse Time” by @haydenreceipts 

 https:// twitter.com/i/moments/1090 681088383614976   …. Lrt I love you both but I think of this literally every time I watch mob psycho...it’s so amazing. I uh got like 3.5 hours of sleep?! I just ..kept waking up and feeling really hot...I’m tryna decide whether or not to go bc it’s like leaving at 8;30 and getting back at 2 for like an hour and a half class. me: (logs into school email)
outlook: one moment while we log you out!
me: wait, no. Me: (feeling feverish) oh no
(Later)
Me: ah I finally cooled down! Actually...actually now I’m really cold..brr............OH NO. I decided No. I drew this in August   its a floaty tho not a boat...close enough? pic.twitter.com/PvCKqRhNBL. Mmmmmm ok one of two profs got back to me..I really hope my other prof got my email bc I really wanted feeebaccccckk. Hey you organized, gotta cut yourself some slack . Ps I did the thing where I wanted to participate but I left a tab w the application open til it closed so ILL DEDICATE MINE TO YOU . Ahaha yeah but it’s a lot of work!! I’ve done this in the past and it was a mess of people dropping out. Having to entertain company is a pain no matter what tho . pic.twitter.com/erAgjZGKzC. Me: maybe I’ll sell my victor and yuuri nendos..since they came when I moved I never even opened the shipping boxes..I can’t possibly *need* them then...I’ll sell them and use the money for Eiji nendo..maybe a spaghetti leg plush
Me: (opens shipping boxes)
Me: oh no, they’re cute. the most unrealistic thing about bnha is Deku's daddy issues never coming up . I've seen like three people tweet talking trash about todoroki and all 3 times it was in response to the 'if you were kidnapped what would you tweet to alert us you need help' post
he's a very loved boy. LMFAOO IS ..IS THAT WHAT HAPPENED
INKO WAS JUST GARDENING ONE DAY MINDING HER OWN BUSINESS AND THEN--. Ahh, I have Ash preordered bc I thought he was more likely to sell out, but I haven't paid for Eiji yet...How can I leave Ash alone though?! /sobbing
GAHH THAT FIGURE IS SO GORGEOUS but I'll never own it bc of the price lmfaoo
I'm still new to the whole figure thing;;. oof I can't believe my prof didn't write back today, she's usually good about that....I really just wanna finish up and post this project already!! It's so cute.. i know i've already made this tweet like 40 times but IM REALLY ENJOYING REWATCHING MP100 .. I ended up switching over to English bc I wanted to watch it in HD on the big screen and I actually am pretty good with most of the casting choices? It's a different experience to understand the audio instead of having to read when it comes to things like joke timing. I also forgot a lot of the story.. like I remember key points but not how we got there so it's like getting to enjoy it like new all over again! Ohhh turns out I’m fb friends with another classmate! I didn’t realize.. Woah. These are actually really solid points I had never considered before...just imagine what our generation may have achieved without Chris Hart LMFAOO—-kidding, kidding~ but really this is an interesting perspective!! small brain: valentines day starts in one day
galaxy brain: @villainsbn  and @star_amet  's The Hunt II Kickstarter starts in two days. me: ok it's midnight maybe I should start drawing
cady: (suddenly cuddles close and starts sleeping on my arm)
me: MMMMM......................... Help pic.twitter.com/NiYP8ejeNZ. OK I'm gonna post this before I can overwork it -
Like everyone else, I absolutely ADORE the Valentine's outfits and want these boys to be happy  

#BANANAFISH  #asheiji pic.twitter.com/HWlKKcXUOw. thank you friend . BUT..MY WALLETTTTT TT A TT I'm ...sure I'll cave and get him soon...............
Ugh yeah I have a hard enough time spending the $ for the nendos so that's...a stretch..maybe one day we'll come into money and get all the intricate anime figures out hearts desire. Aaa thank you!!   Happy Valentines to you too!! I ate too much before bed goodnight. It is when you need that hand to CTRL-Z . Thank you   Happy Valentine’s Day! Well, he’s been pretty heavily in s2 and there’s an arc about him so that’s why everyone’s had a lot of Reigen content to post lately - and next week too I’m sure ahah. Every fic writer who wrote Bakugou winning crane games/carnival games must feel so validated by the drama CD rn. Prof: the fish is hard to read as a fish
Me: probably because it’s a fucking octopus. Other feedback included take only the Japanese text off the Japanese food truck...classic

Damn this kind of misinformed feedback is what happens when you email and don’t show up to explain shit . Seriously tho the only chick who has been to Japan was out sick ..damnit Raine I needed u there to explain taiyaki and shit. SHE DREW INTO HIM OUCH nOW HE HAS A HEAD INJURY (speech bubble by me) pic.twitter.com/b7s9XIoZln. I GOT CONFUSED ABT WHEN CERTAIN THINGS HAPPENED AND THOUGH I HAD 12 MORE EPISODES OF MP100 BUT THEY DONT EXIST YET gdi. It's VALEN-TIMES
 https:// homestarrunner.com/tgs12.html  . My hair is fading in such a weird way bc of the brassy areas we dyed over  pic.twitter.com/c7l821TVjh. Aaa yeah the problem is I want it to be pastel so the purple is starting to get there bc it’s over really light blonde but the pinkier part will fade to orange before the purple gets to really light purple...orz. Agree with this! I just rewatched season one of mp100 and — I love BNHA so much but mp100 Is on another level animation-wise definitely and I think more compelling story-wise too - more comedic moments and more emotional moments without feeling like whiplash.. I ALSO DID THIS and I've never seen UP but that may be my new plan for this evening. everyones drawing cute oc kiss drawings aaa. I love how round these straps are. Thank you!! I like it down but it looks weird in certain styles bc of the difference;;. aaa yeah I might give that a go. Thank you for the suggestion! Next time I'll try to get my hair more even before dyeing to avoid sections washing out way sooner than others. holy shit am I.. THE PROTAGONIST NOW. My Marceau doesn't have a lover : (. But then I'll have to wear my glasses!! > A< Well, I have ones that are purple too.. ohh my bro just remembered Valentine's so I asked if they do it in Colombia since his gf is there and he said they have a day that's similar but a big focus on friendship too and damn I wish we had that here instead!! YEAH I LIKED YOUR POST EARLIER ABOUT OC DATING APP..honestly. i s2g I remember when that site appeared and I tried to make an account like  a month ago only to discover YOU STILL NEED AN INVITE CODE??WHAT THE HELL YEAR IS IT I--. right? he's a cutie. so weird.........
ohhh I didn't know that about charahub, I haven't heard of that one as much;;. i opened photoshop to draw my ocs smooching and got severely distracted. me/???? finished with something weeks before the deadline????????? identity crisis. delivery driver: hi i'm here
my mom: hi
me: ...mom
mom: OH where? at my house?? HOLD ON. mom: he wasn't how I pictured him
me: why? was he hot?
mom: he was kinda nerdy.. I guess you might've liked him
me: rude. not rude!! It's *nice* to follow back, but you shouldn't have to clutter up your feed with content/people you don't care for just cause they followed you. I wouldn't want someone to follow me back out of obligation, it feels disingenuous. every time i see a post abt the fan banana fish tour a piece of me DIES bc i'm not going. ok now i've got *four* cons i've applied to. here's to hoping. THIS IS SO CUTE. Oh no! I’m so sorry :( that must be so frustrating. My friend offered to go with me which is really nice (since she isn’t into the show), but I know it was impractical to come from Boston anyway..Maybe another can be planned sometime more seasonal! I’d offer to make special merch for everyone haha. Aaa it’s be so cute! Maybe one day you could commission it or smth hehe. Itd be great to have it like the Thursday before or Monday after an NYC con! My brain for half a second: let’s just make one here!....oh wait . Hnnn yeah :( and half the fun is making new friends too!! And taking stupid of plushes in important spots . This is so precious!! Have fun and good luck this weekend!! Woah!! I love the color palettes on these! Dekus hair is a super funky green (or maybe it looks funkier bc of the colors around it) and I’m here for it . THAT WAS MY QUESTION. 'over here is the boston public library, where ash definitely didn't die.. so that's dope'. LMFAOO “WHO CARES ABOUT BORING OLE HISTORY ANYWAY—-“ (everyone in group raises hand). Ohh yeah, like how there are lovey chocolates and obligation chocolates? (rapidly flipping through the museum guide pamphlet) TH..THERE MUST BE A PAINTING WITH DINOSAURs OR.. Mummified Shorter, Ash AU . Oh!! My ex and I were on an oh wonder kick a few years ago! They’re really lovely and relaxing to listen to. me: WOW a band i love covering a song i love!!!
me: WOW i don't like it at all. I was excited :( oh well. aaa that's such a classic one! my fave is landslide!! ;)
theres so many good ones tho.. Gonna ignore how insane this graphic is first of all—  

My name is Jennie 
I was born in the purple one 
My age is really good and it’s really fun to be with me 
I like to think about you pic.twitter.com/SOcuwI4uCj. “My name is Adrien Agreste and I’m a goddamn FOOOOOOL” - not episode Stormy Weather Pt2, but should’ve been. The new of ladybug was such a ride...
It was a recap ep which was soooo so weird and then just when you think smth is gonna actually happen..Nope!! 
“3 seasons? Too easy” - ladybug staff 
. pic.twitter.com/Ln0Ql95W2l. LRT HONESTLY. FedEx is the literal worst. I think delivery exception means they didn’t have enough room and said “oh well, guess this person can go fuck themselves”
Sometimes you can pick it up from the facility, idk how close that is to katsu. Aaa good luck Ria!!! . LRT Yessssssss! THE TIME HAS COMMEee Ahaha
Go support these lovelies and grab some pins!! There’s soo much good stuff up their sleeves so help them surpass the goal so it can all come to fruition . Look at you two, so close to the goal and I’m not even out of bed . STILL YOU FRIEND!! ARE U OK BUDDY... Lrt I haven’t posted a pic yet but I’m the proud owner of some of this merch it is SOO LOVELY. I hope you’re right handed at least?   I hope you heal quickly !! Good luck!! Oh?! Is it expensive?! Like a brand name or smth? . ((Pretends to be shocked))

(Seriously tho congrats!! ) pic.twitter.com/hYwG5oExYa. MHA This week's chapter but NO spoilers
aaaa what a solid chapter? It just like, wrapped things up and touched on a little bit of everything. It was a good one to leave on for a break \o/. Super cute and aaa I forgot about this sweet song! omg this is so sweet. I FORGOT TO POST THIS A WHILE BACK but we spotted this flyer in JP pic.twitter.com/jnRnmQnZvc. aerfsetgdrh my fucking
arm 
hurts
curse RSIs i just wanna draw. Here’s the exact face I make every time they almost discover each other’s identities then don’t 

“I don’t know why I expected anything different” - me pic.twitter.com/NB3KcBRMy5.  aaa thank you!! “Could it be?!...No, of course not” - Miraculous, Season 36 Episode 4. I hope they find out one before the other cause that sounds like more of a shit show. holy shit I’d live for that
Half the episodes feel like fan fiction so I feel like that’s very much on the table. agreed!! That way seems a lot better to me too

OOF yeah that’s gonna be tough
I was screaming when Adrien walked in on him in the toilet ?! Like oh my god dude you’ve seen hawkmoth before u fool. new jam https://www. youtube.com/watch?v=XRP9k9 nlAfE   …. HOW...people were recognizing it back@otakon and anyc?! (too sad to leave the house?). LRT holy shit that's weird..have we ever heard Deku say 'Bakugou' before?! spends 3,600 hours making fucking cups for a non-existent food truck this assignment is cursed after all. the napkin is gonna be just sprinkles don’t fucking @me DIANE. for a long time everything i drew was orange or purple now everything's green hm. I think lunch at my high school was around $4 too! There’s sometimes free or reduced programs for people who qualify though 
I think allowance is super varied..some people can’t afford to give it, others give their kids whatever they ask for..maybe a statistic u can look up tho? I thought I read that the creator specifically asked for a brand new team and to make the Fruits Basket reboot totally new from scratch yet Funi is over here casting the same VA? (I’m personally not against it, I think it’ll be interesting, just thought I read that). LRT HOLY SHIT I WNAN GOD NFNNFNDD. I lifted the covers cause i’m hot and this was the exact sight i was greeted with pic.twitter.com/NSuM03Lcnr. me: wow my head hurts
also me: I'm gonna try to animate this drawing. I’m crying my mom bought movie tix to a movie next week. This was not specific enough: I went to the movies w/ my friend, told the  guy that maybe we had the wrong theater number, or someone was in our seats, only for him to call a manager who pointed to the tix which indicated that they’re for NEXT THURSDAy.tHE MOVIE ISNT EVEN OUT YEt. WATCH HIM. You’re le welcome, see this French-Canadian surname isn’t just for show . Oh damn...that sounds p r i c e y
I wish you a prosperous con season friend. Good luck!! Storenvy then? OOF the tilt your head back myth 
(Ps the last one was right. And if your nose is still dry you can get a saline rinse/spray - there’s no meds in it. Just check first bc there were recalls on a few brands recently). It’s nice that people try their best to help though   and I hope your nose feels better!! THEY REALLY BETTER LET ME INTO THEIR AA NOW. I draw the nose, then the mouth, then the eyes...is that weird lmfao. Last day to order!! https:// twitter.com/cambrasine/sta tus/1086110766602825729   …. Yeah they used to be where everyone was selling their art, but then everyone moved to tictail. The only places I can think of w good marketplaces are storenvy and Etsy :( square may have one? Not sure..
And yeah that extra fee is bullshit. Oof really? I didn’t know that
But yeah, 10% is already a chunk, so adding to that is..not ideal. Um ok I just deadass saw a truck with a TRUMP sticker and a MOTHERFUCKING SWASTIKA. A SWASTIKA. In the year 2019. In /Massachusetts/.
How the fuck do you even live ur life with a swastika on your car? How do you not get your tires slashed and windows broken? How do you go to WORK. That’s a big ass mood. (My mom standing still in one foot)
Me: did you stub your toe?
Mom: on my damn typewriter (on the floor)
Me: well maybe that’s not the best place for it, maybe you should put it bACK IN 1980. me: maybe this is the year I cave and go to fucking c*nnecticon
c*nnecticon: $350 pls
me: what the h e l l , no. OH MY GOD I HATE THEM
You haven't done that con, right? I thought I heard it wasn't great too but it's been a while since I've even considered going bc I was so mad at them about the year they didn't put up a date and just emailed a list of people the day before
like i was on that list but that's not the point >:| a dick move!! I remember hearing it's not great, so how the hell do they want you to pay $450 (including CT tax permit) to be there. small cons are getting so ballsy these days yeesh. SERIOUSLY THO ASIDE FROM LIKE AX most *anime* cons aren't over $300 >:(. hey kids is nek*con any good. i'm..so almost done w this project but of course that behind-the-eyes migraine is starting up again.......pls stop. every year I *think* about attending for fun but never do :P. holy shit * Q*. OOF Vet bills are so harsh, but gotta take care of the fur babies!   I hope your slots fill up fast!! Only on etsy i s2g. it's just like....do u do this when you shop irl ... by irl i meant...in a store.................(oops). These are so cute!! I've seen a few water bottles around, but these are so unique and I'm sure con goers loved using them while walking around! mom: oh my godd look at this, it's so cute!
mom: (knowingly shows me my own drawing). i'm just trying to imagine walking into a store, buying something, walking out, waiting 30 seconds, walking back inside, returning it. My mock food truck for surface design!  

Inspired by T*iyaki NYC (No Affiliation) + Japanese festival foods. I had a lot of fun redesigning my ice cream mermaid for this!

I cannot remember the manga well at all but doesn't like, shou light their house on fire or some shit
i'm not ready. omg i'll look forward to it!! fuuuuck I hurt my arm shoveling almost a week ago and it hurts the same now as it did then.....moderately concerned....I know it's not from drawing bc it's like..this weird spot where my arm meets my shoulder blade and my tricep. Ps help my name my oc. Dhdhdhsbshdjsj this is gonna be a Ride. Ugh, I'm so sorry this is happening to you! For reference, I had a similar situation just a couple months ago where someone charged ~ $300 on my account. They had to wait for them to move out of pending before disputing the charges, but Santander did gave me the money back. regardless of whether the companies they had to argue with gave them the $ back or not...So it *should* work out but it takes some time, which can be devastating.. I hope you can reach someone soon :(. I sort of have this assignment done..but idk that these are the *best* thumbnails so I'll feel more anxious presenting them but...................I don't feel motivated to make more...........................depression v anxiety, let's gooo. my bro left us sourdough starter and he's gonna be mad that we haven't made any bread yet but no one signed up for this lmfao. HE DOES AND..THERES A WORSE PART TOO IT but if you don't remember then I don't wanna spoil ya

me: haha teru and mob are my faves, but shou is cute too
me: wait, didn't he ------- oh god. DO U WANT TO OR NOT. CAUSE I CAN STFU OR I CAN TELL U AND WE CAN YELL. SO  everyone's Fine I'm p sure he evacuates them, but HE LIGHTS THE HOUSE ON FIRE AND I think he like, shows Mob his family's burnt dead bodies..OR SMTH...AGAIN D ONT QUOTE ME I READ IT TWO YEARS AGO. ...tell me what it tastes like,,, I can only imagine. Yeah..  The cat censoring made me have to dig through the manga to make sure I wasn't crazy lmfao 
I'm sure it won't be graphic, but again like the cat it's like..a key trigger so they have to do /somthing/. SAME ..BC IT WAS SO DISTRESSING TO MOB BUT ALSO TO ME (AND YOU) HAHA
We were spared but also I kinda wish they were able to do it for the full effect, yknow? YES..gosh I wanna review and finish reading mp100 so badly but i'm.......SCARED. I've been putting off reading banana fish too bc of the EMOTIONAL DISTRESS they will surely cause me haha.

She just brought me this Mob and Dimple   She doesn’t have a squirt bottle so she did her best with the tools she had... pic.twitter.com/MctIUgfYLK. She is a blessing . She did this completely unprompted i love her . Initially she didn’t want me to post them but I like that the wonkiness kinda gives me the same feeling as the manga style. BDNDUSHSN Ohmygod you’re right. Oof I forgot I shoveled yesterday
I Feel it fjcjdn. AAA THIS IS SO COOL!!   I’ve never had someone do this for my art before, so it’s so interesting to see!! Thank you!!  It’s also fun to see your drawings for other artists and be like “ooh I wanna check that artist out!” based on that! Overheard at lunch.. 
Mom: we have to walk all the way across the street
Kid: can we drive? I just encountered the most entitled person I —. When she entered the store the woman working w us was sure to greet her. Literally less than 30 secs later she comes back over and says “I was going to do business here but the woman at the desk ignored me so I’ll be leaving” ...the other employee was checking out a customer.. She didn’t ignore u u fool she was helping another customer why would she ever ditch them mid transaction and help you  b y e. I hope you feel better soon . So cute!! Omg I love the pattern inside too. me: OOOOHH I GOT INTO ANIMEN**T
mom: (just as excitedly) OH MY GO D WHICH ONE IS THAT?
me: ITS ONE THATS JUST OK BUT ITS ONLY IN NEW JERSEY!! I also just have negative experiences associated w this con- I was running an hour and a half back and forth to philly every day to see my bf AND it was our 1st ever airbnb + the woman  STAYED W US, and was selling the house + HAD A SHOWING WHILE WE WERE TRYING TO GET DRESSED. Oh no holy shit my mom and I were sobbing at this anime...good luck friend. Animeyeet. it feels like..not worth it to go to animen**t but what am i gonna *not* do it yknow. I haven't been since 2016 which I believe was the new venue, AND I was in the very back facing the far wall so I literally had someone say to me after they didn't even know I was there and several people later in the weekend be like '...were u here this whole time?'. Oof!! Yeah, it's pretty rough > A<. Website: young adult: $5 adult: $10
me: oh good i'm a young adult!
website: Young adult is 21 and under
me: ex-fucking-cuse you. I FEEL LIKE..OBLIGATED TO DO IT but I probably only broke even last time.. I mean I've improved since then but still makes me nervous..YEAH EVEN THE AIRBNBS ARE FREAKING PRICEY. hnn yeah like..when driving is feasible it feels like 'oh it's local i should go'..it's like..idk 5 hours for me? ,,,,, also this year has just been so dismal for cons it feels stupid to turn one down.

If you're unable to resolve the issue, you should write something in that space too to inform chrome users to use another browser. yeah...................they're got half an hour to fix it..we'll see :|.

(pic in OP). my prof said tomorrow is in class work day so i'm trying to decide if I should do some stuff today and be further along for tomorrow or say fuck it and just do it tomorrow?
sometimes I feel too stressed to draw well in class so I don't wanna be sitting there doing nothing either. this is so upsetting and I need to tag @perdizzion. idk if i'm pmsing or what but i have lost control of my tear ducts the last few days. ..... pic.twitter.com/AV2lOiWpyr. Crumb (? Maybe . Idk bread terms bruh) pic.twitter.com/2PEz9wJhyi. ITS ACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD. Ok, it's done! It's actually pretty good!

My mom /likes/ it, but she doesn't like sour bread much so  https:// twitter.com/cambrasine/sta tus/1100129129230422016   …. everyones getting justifiably frustrated w funi bc they said ticket sales for fruits basket were supposed to go up, then they said jk we're finalizing details and now no updates for 3 days.. fruits basket twitter: READY FOR NEWS

me: ...................i s2g. time for my least favorite part of doing cons - guessing how much stock to order \o/ .. i hate this. I'm trying to be really picky with my ordering and using what I sold at the same con last year for reference but I'm scared I'm under ordering,..but I don't wanna put out $ now when I don't have other cons til summer.. I'm about to order too many mailers bc I love that good good bulk price, so if any friends wanna commit to buying some off me at Zenkai then I'll bring them along for ya, just lemme know. Will RT when closer too! 4'' x 6.75" , 23 cents each  This kind:  https://www. ecoenclose.com/shop/recycled- mailers/recycled-bubble-mailers/   …. ohh! Can do!! ;) 
Yeah if you buy in the packs of 25 it ends up being double the price per mailer, so i'm biting the bullet for five hundo and my friend's taking some.. LMFAO. LMFAOO NO YOU'RE SAVING ME FROM HAVING A BAJILLION MAILERS SITTING AROUND! Even with my friend taking some it'd probably take me a year or two to go through the rest.. will do! I set a reminder for myself! . LRT LMFAOO what a cute tush. OH NOOOO I just remembered I finished the ice cream I had here......it's still insanely windy so going out isn't an option :(. umbrella academy spoilers //

Pls feel free to throw pics of your dogs at me for anxiety-relieving and also drawing purposes thank you pic.twitter.com/FUve1ku57Z. hey y'all.. help me out?

I can't decide whether to use a lighter tone paper and dark line or vice-versa.. Poll in Replies!

Also yeah look forward to my first real /zine/ zine ever;; pic.twitter.com/Dg0egIplzr. (Pic in OP)
[I'll also consider the general preference for the lighter vs darker paper in these votes]. Can’t believe the bank is insisting that - even tho it was on the same day and among the dozens of other fraudulent charges - *I* definitely made the purchase in Istanbul, Turkey

Sounds fucking fake s*ntander. Same y’all same..thank you for voting! I like the idea of the white line but I like the look of madero beach best :(. I LOVE DOGS W EYEBROW MARKINGS AAAAAA GOOD DOG. Omg both your pups have eyebrows I’m cryin. A pretty name for a pretty pup! Omg look at those gorgeous locks. Omg how old? My puppy used to do this to every toy we got her but she’s calmed down now :P She still pulls it out of one that’s already ripped tho.. Omg he’s worse than Cady then!!  I hope his toy destroying habit doesn’t wreak havoc on your wallet hahah. Need a mental work out? Try Ad*be Illustrator . Honestly yes. One of my profs has some special event next week so he can’t come, then it’s spring break...3 weeks for this project...blessed. OMG I just noticed — is that banana fanfic under there? I’m glad I’m learning it but also my brain turns to mush every Tuesday evening. Who made this program and why. GUH I can’t believe people actually use this thing
Like I get it but also god why . I’m so sorry you have to use it.. Why are you trying to kill me . “You want money? THEN U FIGURE IT OUT” *throws receipts*. I finished watching umbrella academy!!! Do u think the person who committed fraud w my card understands how much of a headache they caused me. I’m screaming the bank even made a freaking typo on the letter where they insist I made a purchase in Turkey I’m —- pic.twitter.com/TfxD374Zv3. Me: OHHH DID U SAY MY CARD CAME TODAY?!
Mom: oh yeah
Me: SHOULD I MAKE A PURCHASE...like.........spaghetti strings plush....... She sleeps w her foot in the air sometimes  pic.twitter.com/vxJA1IxdLs. err I think I waited too long on spaghetti plush...apparently it's not direct like some other purchases so they prob wont place it in time........ Too early in the morning to be this salty but feels like it’s not my fault  and shouldn’t be my responsibility as a student to fund the printmaking department. Oof not loving the packaging job today pic.twitter.com/lrpWvuMtw3. Face down by red jumpsuit apparatus actually written abt this Boston kreme. aa my prof liked my doggos and she's saying try cats so uh...send me your kitties!! those markings are SOOO PRECIOUS <3. I was just peeing and someone knocked on the door like dude it’s locked what do u think is happening rn. Me earlier this year: it’s so hard to get into cons, at least we can buy Fl*mecon tables 
Fl*mecon: actually ..go fuck yourself. Aaa yeah I normally do fire or water but I like him best . smooth jam https://www. youtube.com/watch?v=SXUezP ili4A   ….

I’ve never seen any problems when anyone’s proposed projects with lgbt themes in class, but I admit I go to a pretty liberal school in a pretty blue state. I know it may be stressful but if they have a problem with it then that’s /their/ problem. Create work that’s true to you. and who knows - you may have classmates who aren’t out yet or out in that setting who may appreciate it! :). I was so worried abt the things I had to show for class today+my prof really liked them both+I was just ???
Also I normally go 1st for crit bc of where I sit but she changed things up today so I went last + all I could do thru everyone else’s critique was worry about my own . Next week will be halfway thru the semester 
I need to chill out ufnfjdndjck easier said than done. hOW. Aaa congrats! { RTs  } I wanted to try drawing my redesigned OC in chibi style to multiply the cuteness factor  

This drawing is available as an acrylic keychain (with a super fun add-on imo)@ http:// cambrasine.art/shop-all      More images in replies  pic.twitter.com/Hw1UegYVOK. Check out  http:// cambrasine.art/shop-alll    to get this cutie!

In my dream last night I was in an artist alley where everyone just had those trifold poster boards as displays . I finished it yesterday and I wanna watch more but I doesn’t exist yet . Also if you go too late in the day they’ll say it’s broken but really they just already cleaned it. lrt gdi only the cinema w no reserved seating > A<. Here's the thing no one asked for! Pink is played, blue is didn't play! Cyndaquil is my fave from gen 3 but I chose Chikorita in Crystal...then Cyndaquil again in the gen 3 remake :P  ..I hope to play the new one but I'd have to buy a switch...so we'll see :| pic.twitter.com/EvIvFOe79Y. please give me an adulting star i decided to get off my ass and clean smth bc since my bro left and my mom got a concussion this place went to shit sdfigdjdfth. oof you ever drop a cool $$$$ on an aa table + badges, lodging, and charms . If I can just..somehow claw my way into Anime B*ston AA..... Zenk*i table assignments are out and woah I’m near the window for the first time 
Not sure how to feel abt this development after cursed anyc windows.. You can go inside the zenkaikon building on google maps!! I know bc I just did it bc I couldn’t remember how many windows there were  

But Ohmygod yes when I packed for anyc I was like “SUNGLASSES!!!0. I always forget to ask to be next to friends at cons lately :(. I don’t remember the name of the artist who was next to me at Zenk*i last year, but I do remember that:
1. She was very nice 
2. One day she wore a dress I also own
3. Every day she took off her shoes, put her prints all over the floor, and stepped and stood on them . Oh shit you’re right behind me   we def won’t forget the mailers then!! “I’ve landed on active listening and will no longer be chiming in” #Brooklyn99  ... this is such a good line. AAAAAAAAAAAAAA. Ugh I really wanna like organize my portfolio properly but idk how it’s Like.. Illustration and Pattern+Surface ? . Idk how to neatly categorize my work and some things fall in both categories or like the food truck I made the truck, cups, menu etc like it needs its own gallery? Idk Aaaaa. Wish I could say I haven’t been there before . Mm maybe I could have like smaller thumbs for small projects on top of a diff gallery for each bigger project ? /sobbing 

But yeah it’s hard to categorize stuff, and i feel like its even harder to be objective about your own work.. Shdndush yeah I guess ?? Character could be its own category?? I feel like your portfolio is organized p well tho actually!

It’s also hard cause certain cons want things sorted by fan/original toonxbfbbdj. WOAH!! Big step!!   Congratulations!! update: I did??? some stuff? I changed the portfolio page to have image previews with each category, separated surface+pattern out from original illustration. my only other thing is like..should i pull out the character design and have it be its own category? 1/2. 2/2 Like I haven't taken character design yet or done a lot but I do have some ocs, different mermaids, neapolitan cat+donut bear, rad rabbit, etc. .. It feels not strong enough for it's own section but when its in with original illustration its comparatively less finished/no bgs. This is the best version of an “oh shit that thing was meant for THIS package but I already...” story I’ve ever heard. Lrt is a big mood. I feel like I come off as super spacey or dumb sometimes but it’s just bc I’m anxious. This is lovely. JUST REALIZED I NEVER WROTE BACK but if you just search the con center and dangle the guy over the building -- you see all the little circles -- those are points you can look at within the building :)

The bathroom is really near! pic.twitter.com/vOKOTSAif6.  aaa Thank you for the compliments!! You're too kind! It needed a wash - it had roast beef sauce stain on it already, but this was the final nail in the coffin. this is hilarious bc i almost replied tagging you before you tweeted this
I want it. aaa smort, I just hate the idea of maintaining even more sites/platforms. "The whole shit is totally fucked" - my brother regarding flights. That thread was so fucked up. gawesdrftgh i adore this song. He’s objectively the cutest. sTOP. Usually my stress dreams and nightmares are really bizarre situations but last night they were based on real fears which was shittier dhndjdjd. Aaaa it’s so cute on you! Test! I was gonna try to paint or make and use a stencil to make it more charming but I found some clear sticker vinyl while cleaning and honestly if it adheres well it’d save me a lot of time and I wouldn’t potentially destroy smth that cost $$ pic.twitter.com/4nk0hGWkae. You’ve got this!! I know i preach abt this song all the time but its just so perfect for when you're feeling shit abt yourself https://www. youtube.com/watch?v=ntthrY gpOKY   …. hey LA / AX peeps - where's good to stay for Anime Expo? We back up booked some crazy expensive hotel but we'd rather get an airbnb. (Back when AA sign ups were you couldn't book that far in advance;;). Aaa waitlisted at an*mazement... Lrt me when my friends wanna make plans every week. beauty. I was gonna say selective color!! I find it really helpful for photos too ! No prob!! (Also I probably should've lead with this but I adore this painting..cozy vibes). lrt these are so cute and aa i love the concept..like.. an art trade but also a collab?? that's Amazing. zzzzzz it's 7:40 can i go to bed yet.. gsdthfgh seriously, at 6:00 I couldn't keep my eyes open in the car..

Seems like!! Maybe??? (Thank you for the well wishes ). LMFHABDJFBDS OHMYGOD. HONESTLY. If I get a third email saying jk u out I will lose it. Update.  pic.twitter.com/dIPQCiTmtJ. I h8 being right. Anime north playing with my heart saying U didn’t get in, then jk U did, then no wait really you Didn’t. anyway HMU if you’re looking for a secondary artist . Not cool I’m way more bummed than if I’d been rejected once ugh. I s2g that was ridiculous. IT FEELS WAY WORSE CAUSE I ALREADY GOT EXCITED FOR IT. Shdhhddhdbsndndk AN why this. YEP. Once was bad enough but TWICE I’m ——. I’ve been in a real funk the last few days and finally got my spirits back up a little and then This grrt. Ps if you ever wanna be mean to me this would be a good prank to pull bc it Got me . my bro's already on ep 8 of umbrella academy and still on ep 0 of mp100. I love them both but ........MOB PSYCHO . big same. Didn’t get in   the third of three emails said so orz. Such shit. Yeeppp. @ lanimani. Why is this so funny Ohmygod look at kirishima. Ohmygod. This reminded me one time I walked out of a store, shopping bag in hand, and the receipt blew OUT OF THE BAG, then into the air and up over a two story building and I probably just stood there for a minute. But your story is much more tragic. I like to imagine that on the other side of the world someone who is having a worse day finds the bag, goes “what’s this?”, and enjoys the cupcake. I wonder if this is a cultural thing or an individual thing bc in my experience people here will almost always choose the slightly damaged option to save a few $ . Yeah and I feel like every listing I buy says please don’t buy if you’re picky and then nothing has been damaged at all ??? I applied to m*tsuricon but I didn’t realize it was so smoll and so far  so of course I got in orz But I think it’s not worth it..... GOOD NEWS EVERYONE My credit score has gone up from 640 to 641 thanks to my brand new credit card! Gee whiz adult life sure is exciting. mom: my quirk is done for the day
me: your..quirk?
mom: accounting.
me: your quirk is..accounting?!
mom: ACCOUNTING!!! FIGURES NUMBERS FASTER THAN---. pochacco and my melody! I think this is a perpetual thing. You’ll always like what someone else is making bc you can’t make it that way - not bc anyones BETTER/WORSE - but because you’re You and they’re Them. Like everyone will make something different than each other because we’re individuals. Yknow? So in the same way that you value what someone else’s makes bc you like the way they’re brain works, someone else is loving what you’re making bc it’s different than how they’re brain worked ?! Idk I’m bad@words. Yeah every time I see a vague tweet about Some Shit I take two steps back right the hell outta there shdnfjsn. I feel like Klaus is like 4 out of 5 of people’s favorite bc how can you not. I think the practicality (of good pockets) should come first when it comes to smth like a backpack ! You’ll regret it later if you have pockets that don’t fit your needs. Oof. Did I ghost write this I was Just about to tweet this??
I find looking at other artist’s renditions helpful bc you can more easily identify which attributes are most important to make them recognizable.  drawing real people is a real pain in the dick but I love umbrella academy so I’m gonna try for y’all pic.twitter.com/H4tmln6Q2D. Sleep Cycle tells me “good morning” and “good evening” but I could really use a “bitch you best get to bed”. I feel like Klaus would prob be the easiest bc you can kinda stylize him more easily bc he’s so animated haha 
Won’t know til ya try! Omg lum for Mina is a good match and jfc Bakgou’s outfit  . Omg I never ride this train anymore —- my first class got out two hours early cause everyone is dead of the plague and my second was cancelled—- but I’m in the “quiet car”?! Amazing. This shit drives me Crazy! Like half the pins on Kickstarter are like this...and a lot of the time the person makes bad color decisions and it just makes it worse ahbdfj. HDHHSHDHD IS IT REALLY 16?! BUT YOURE RIGHT ITS AT LEAST 10..even if you’ve never made a pin you gotta do your research . hnn I was so happy to be out early but then I got my period exactly when class ended and I took meds right away but now the cramps are Really settling in. my prof had such a good suggestion and this zine is gonna look 6x better now..blessed. me: why am i getting into no cons
me: shit why am i getting into cons that are all over the fucking place and right after one another. i'm intimidated by her but i trust her w my life. here's a visual nightmare (Screams)

I'm
not sure about this y'all pic.twitter.com/jwglSVmBLL. (sobbing) why isn't trading AA tables a thing. WAIT-- Matsuricon or Anime Matsuri? I'm talking about Anime Matsuri (in TX, 40k attendance). Oh no... i ........ *stares into the distance*. ah someone just replied to me w smth abt this.. SO..UNDS BAD? THANK Y'ALL FOR WARNING ME ABT ANIME MATSURI. I remember when the Boycott AM thing started but my pea brain did not remember that it was That con. So . BYE.

Terrible, but - great, now I don't have a problem!!! (Although apparently AM continues to have many problems!!!!). Looking at all this AM shit gave me a headache, my goodness. YEAH I SEE THAT THERES SO MUCH TERRIBLE STUFF THERE BIG BIG BIG YIKES. (Thanks for the heads up <3 ). I am Super Not going to table there!!! Thank you for alerting me to this! I remember seeing it way back when but I didn't remember which con it was!! s*n japan: you're not in but we have this contest
me: hm i will have a lot free time in may
s*n japan: the theme is sports
me: .. ya lost me. Also the AN*rth thing was still unprofessional and stressful, but they just emailed saying we'll be added to the waitlist so I do appreciate them doing Something bc I've seen a lot of mess-ups that were not rectified or acknowledged at all. Yep!! Esp. when there's another con with such a similar name. I put it in deep red and wrote NO next to it on my con spreadsheet so I'll know for the future! TURNS OUT YES ITS VERY BAD!!  People made sure to let me know and I’m very grateful bc as a Jewish Woman with Any Morals, I am Not Attending    (Sexual assault allegations, letting a nazi take over a cancelled panel, and more fun Anime Matsuri tales..). Oof cramps waking me up? It’s more likely than you think. ((Adds to reading list)). Lrt “Dad, sTOP”. HAPPY BORTH FREN. ((Puts more bedding in your cardboard box)) there you go, buddy
Also I could eat pasta every night this is indeed a Sweet Deal. I wish I could RT. Djhdudjd why is cramp day the day we have a field trip to a museum. My prof decided our project would be due next class even tho we normally get two weeks so guess spring break is fake. The whole point of spring break is to have a Break not squeeze more work in...why don’t some profs understand this. Accurate. Hnn I’ll try to budget my time but my plan was to clean before my bro comes home and con prep too so orz. Sorry for all the “woes me” tweets it’s been a rough few days  I’ll try to hit reset! It’s That good . Oh no I can’t believe my fave totally Is that guy I feel betrayed ..why did u have to bring this to my attention . I'm all confused from my nap but I was so fatigued I couldn't keep my eyes open - luckily that sleep was Way better than the last few nights aaa I wish I could've kept sleeping but 4pm is a little too early for bed LMFAO. Calling it a day on this project!   I was pretty stuck on what to do for a home collection, but when in doubt..DOGS! It ended up matching the white/gray theme of my kitchen..
(PS As you may have seen, I'll be making myself a similar treat jar so I'll post pics when that's done!) pic.twitter.com/CyrE6YvXkE. Close up of the pattern! 
I may make a couple bandanas, but my dog likes to be  f r e e ...maybe she'd be ok to model for 5 mins tho  pic.twitter.com/U5RTk3WYAv. awsdfyguhj Thank you . Me too!! I wish I had that kind of ceramic-making or manufacturing power ahhah

One day maybe someone will hire me for things like this..THAT's..THAT'S THE PLAN ANYWAY HAHA... lmfao yes ok
I was like I'll send this to spoonflower but then I have to hem(?) it(?) 
then I was like wait...it's a 2 layer screen print u fool. a friend???Buying smth??from me?? not in my house. I just imagined him having a mini closet of bandanas and it was cute af. look at this expensive dog bandana website ??? they're pretty but like ??? nearly $30??  http://www. thefoggydog.com/collections/do g-bandanas   …. Ahhh, unfortunately not!   It's a mock up for my advanced surface design class - Our assignment was to create a home collection for an Anthropologie-type store.

I will likely be screen printing bandanas soon, but that's about all little ole me can manage from this collection;;. LRT "BETWEEN THE TWO OF US" dirsghdtohmygod.  thank you friend~~. haha Well, maybe someday! That's the goal, anyhow. But thank you so much! That means a lot  

Also, I am modifying an existing jar to make a similar one for myself - here's my paper mock up if you're interested to see it  :) https:// twitter.com/cambrasine/sta tus/1101983669001089029   …. Ouch!!! bby girl   I wish her a swift recovery. ...she's filled w catnip, confirmed. should've bought my AB badge months ago bc lets face it I'm going barring extreme circumstances. if anyone wants to quell my day-of table anxiety pls tell me abt your experiences my crops are dying. tbh i'd be whining too    Some dogs are dramatic tho! Gotta coddle her, but not /too much/ or she'll use it against you lmfao. Oof yeah my other friend just said they went at 5 AM ...Wait - was this last year? The forums for last year say that at 10 AM they'll give out numbers for a lottery so now I'm ??????? oof yeah unfortunately that seems really on-brand, but I just e-mailed just in case they reply (sigh) I know someone who got one last year so I just asked them too;; 
Idk how to feel bc getting up at dawn sounds bad but at least that's within my control, whereas a lottery isn't. ok i'm ordering bandanas!! I talked to my classmate and she's not paying ANYTHING for the studio fee since she's using all her own supplies, meanwhile bryan over here tryna get one hundo fifty outta me ?? even tho?? I'm using my own supplies? so I'm sending another email. post-nap I checked 5 things off my to do list??? it's only midnight..I could do..more........ Whoohoo!! LMFAO I THINK I WORE HIM DOWN
I’m not good at advocating for myself but with some push from my prof and info from my classmate it worked out!  pic.twitter.com/sReNfCyktV. I pretty much read this as “ok fine please stop calling here” . I’m drooling over her masquerade outfit !! W o w. i can finally post this so i['m trying to animate it and it's hilarious and painful bc I know next to nothing abt animating ITS GONNA BE EMBARASSINGSRDGFh. Here's the still/hi-res!! Gif in OP! I don't know how to animate, but I sure did try!  pic.twitter.com/ZCHmMeLXN2.  Thank you kohi!! 
PS I love seeing all your insta stories of your kitty cats!!! * U*. Cady has all these fancy toys yet the only one she cares about for weeks now is a plain green tennis ball.... i'm looking at transparencies and amazon is trying to tell me these ones are frequently bought with my exact printer..I am so suspicious.  aaa Thank you so much!! I had a lot of fun w this!! I finally finally found my precious zines from when I moved a year and a half ago but uhhh I don’t think these will fit with all the new ones I got . A TIGHT FIT BUT !! pic.twitter.com/k7oKtDMmbK. There’s so many different things in here it’s crazy..I also have a good chunk that are narrative that I never actually read so once I’m done cleaning my room maybe I’ll have time to read them . The key to effective cleaning/unpacking is to put everything on your bed so even when you’re tired and feel done you Cannot Be Done and Must Continue pic.twitter.com/rtvl6rkX4N. Aaa thank you!! I adore it too * U* I got it on etsy a while ago!! . Turning this into cleaning/incredibly delayed unpacking thread.. pic.twitter.com/xk0RB6p3gX. LMFAOOO HOLY SHIT I totally see that I’m the photo from afar
Up close not so much  pic.twitter.com/Excc8ydEHh. Ehenwjehe idk how many hours that was but wow. Still so much to do even just within my room   my knees are probably bruised too..gotta switch gears and clean the main floors and art room next time cause that’s what my bro will get worked up abt . that last sentence would be a good bio  
(PS good luck at the con!  ). Me: Bandanas are coming Thursday 
Mom: Bananas? 
Me: Bandanas! I said it, it was a soft a D 
Mom: Well, yknow nobody wants a soft D
me: mOM—. Convention: You have been selected..
Me: !!!
Con: ..for the next waiting list
Me: ... Aaaa so many good stupid/amazing lines this chapter - most from Bakugou   I took a ton of screenshots ..I wanna post one as a meme but I have to wait hnn. Idk how the word next snuck in there . Do your best, but know that unpacking is a Process. When we moved in my neighbors said they still have boxes from three years ago, and I myself just tackled four from a year and a half ago last night ! Lmfao most of them have props meanwhile Sing is just standing there looking stressed out .  asrgjfkd you’re too kind!! I made the mistake of trying to tackle the pile on my desk in my room and. There's nice notes from teachers, cards I wanna keep, doodles from friends, prints of all mediums, shapes, and sizes, doodles I want to keep but away, doodles I want to keep and reference, etc. etc.dfgfh. Aaa wow!! Thank you so much!! I only just learned to make patterns a few months ago, so I'm definitely still learning, but I'm glad you're enjoying my work so far!! . I am seriously starting to question this scale..it said I was heavier than ever which it’s like oof ok maybe? But over the past month or so it’s saying I’ve gained another 5 pounds?? That feels really unlikely?? ?? Maybe? Every time my mom says how much she took from my account the number gets lower and lower yet she hasn’t paid me back any..a mystery   .... Btw this NWT Yut-Lung still needs a home!  $25
Free shipping in the US, $9 to CAN, $12 to MEX, $14 everywhere else
.
#bananafish  #yutlung pic.twitter.com/0BVIUApEVq. MINE WERE DONE WAY QUICKER THAN USUAL TOO I was like damn I could’ve made new designs . Omg why are you ordering again if you have nothing new to get? Just need to restock? :o. Cons keep changing their app dates without any acknowledgment of the change, leading me to question my sanity . Please y’all just write “it has been delayed to x date”, don’t 1984 it . “Hm I swore the page said today a minute ago and also the form, my reminders, and my con spreadsheet said today but yknow maybe I’m wrong” - genuinely me. I did bad math bc I had a headache and missed sacanime sign ups.....it's the same weekend as anext so that's fine but like...u fool. migraines making me unable to do math properly is a longstanding issue that plagued me in middle and high school. Ashdbdn my friend dropped his wallet in his driveway so now instead of paying me back I get to pay for both of us + his gas to get home...Jennie’s funds..dwindle orz. Hello twitter be proud of me I went tubing even tho I was scared pic.twitter.com/QMlsXPRfMk. Due to mistakes on both sides we ended up w 17 tacos and it shows ..LMFAOO pic.twitter.com/xgLPrvdena. Aa thank you!! I even got hurt on the first run but I gave it another shot and had fun afterwards! OHMYGOD you found this Cursed plush irl? Aaa daylight savings I hate you I was going to bed late and now I’m going to bed REALLY LATE . Oof mood. The weirdest thing ever just happened. I woke up to 0 new emails. Between my period, 2 days of cleaning, snow tubing, and daylight savings my body is just like “please...mercy...”. Trying to purge myself of some stuff by donating it to Zenk*ikon for the volunteers!
It's all good fan prints+merch -just some things I've lost interest in, or had thrown at me, or got extra from trades and it's like. Overwhelming. Just a giant bag of merch living under my desk. me every time new BNHA merch is announced pic.twitter.com/kvQfAJSehg. how do I delete someone else's tweet. I waited three days to make this tweet, please clap. I hope these supplies arrive more quickly so I can go into the studio while everyones away on break /vibrates. Very happy w my decision to put a shelf along the bottom of the big window in my room, not as happy w my earlier decision to pile all my remaining unpacked shit right there. someone design this stupid scarf for me. if my prof doesn't like this i'm quitting school, after hours of fiddling I have No Other Ideas for this lmfadsigfhgyjhahaenrdfnghelp. 
(omg this was a really good comment). Phew! There’s still a lot of junk all around my room but at least one more surface is functional  I hung up some more prints too but still more to come - and more shelves!! pic.twitter.com/Df6vn9LNin. Honestly I think this may have been @grimmfirefly  ‘s idea but I can’t remember —  BUT YEAH ITS always so awkward cause it feels bad to sell it and feels bad to donate it to a plave where it won’t be appreciated and giving away for free online involves mailing it so— CONS! Yes!! I’ll be happy that they go to good home where they’ll be appreciated and not shoved in a drawer like they are with me ! I was so groggy all day and now it’s 1 and I’m AWAKE AND WANNA GET STUFF DONE but I wanna get on a better schedule and I’m Conflicted. Not totally similar but I Want To Eat Your Pancreas will make you sob so hard.. please watch it!! (And ignore the misleading title). HASN'T HE BEEN THROUGH ENOUGH. F u c k
my mom caught a cold
which means I risk having it in a week and a half
for Zenkaikon
and my bro being home
and also school
plea..se............immune system..i'm begging u..do your job... (I love my mom and I feel bad that she’s not feeling well but she doesn’t have many obligations rn she’s just like “oh no I can’t clean the house before Adams home” but it’s more like I now have to try to clean everything by myself   ). Just a normal day - wake up just past noon, fill out artist alley applications in bed, yknow. Thank you so much!! I haven't had a post be so popular in AANI for a while, but I'm glad she's getting love and attention!!    I had a lot of fun trying different styles on her ! THIS LOOKS SUPER COOL THO. It’s technically warm air but there’s 16 mph winds and i feel betrayed. Still waiting on the fluffy ice cream cone keychains but   She’s here  

I’ll have these at Zenkaikon table 21 and they’re online now@ http:// cambrasine.art/shop-all     pic.twitter.com/xeOyeyh3Ml. Super cuuuuuteeeee. Lrt rii fucking slays me I love their work so much I can’t get over it. Big 3 standees also came in!! 
They turned out sooo cute - I’m gonna keep this one on my desk! 

I’ll have these at Zenkaikon table 21, and they’re online now@ http:// cambrasine.art/shop-all     pic.twitter.com/2gNHDax9SE. (Sorry for the dust/Cady hair in the photo  ). Smolls. ok here's the deal -- there aren't photos of totes in this color, but there are photos of bandanas in the same color from the supplier so I feel like that's The Color - should I recklessly just order some bc they take a long time to arrive and I only have x weeks in the studio. sigh. watching my mom do the same shit she criticizes me for and I can understand her frustration bc it's sooo frustrating. alas, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.. Mom: ugh my brother..I wish I could pay someone to listen to him...
Me: he can, that’s literally a therapist. ok totes ordered, bandanas should be here Thursday.. please give me the strength and free time to screen print some stuff before Zenkai!! I'm a little worried about z*nkaikon bc I haven't done a con since November so I always feel rusty/get anxious, and bc it's like a month earlier than usual I hope that doesn't affect attendance.. Me: what should I put in this shelf
@grimmfirefly  : Cat!
Me: Yeah and then PETA will bust out and—
Caitlin: Who’s PETA?—
Me: WHO’s PeTA?!
Caitlin: ohhh Peeta, Hunger Games, I got you 
Me: ... my best friend from kindergarten got engaged and bought a house. ok I couldn't help myself and-- The outside AND Every. Single. Room. are painted Beige. I hope they paint some of it, I can't imagine.. our house looks so different from when we bought it
the only room we didn't at least /paint/ is the downstairs bathroom bc it's Cursed. A small army. Fuck the fact that my prof said “don’t work on it more til I get back to you” makes me worry she’s gonna have a problem w it or tell me to start over dhfjfnf. USPS: ohh your package is over the completely arbitrary amount of 8 oz? You can go fuck yourself then. Yesssssss. Hm I guess you have to weigh (pun not intended) the options of selling less but having few issues to selling more but possibly having more damaged books 
Idk what you’re book is like but I typically send soft cover perfect bound books in a bubble mailer alone w very few incidents. you ever take weeks to decide on a color and weight of paper, decide, feel super accomplished, then go to order it and ??? it's just?? not there??? 
Like I have a sample of it in my hand yet I can't...buy iT? pleawrsojhtdhjr. UPDATE YOU CAN ONLY CALL THEM, THERE IS NO OPTION TO EMAIL 
is this hell. my mom just used the term "raw dog" i'm going to disintegrate. the truth is
zap sux. I GOT ONE OF THESE TOO it was Shocking. RIGHT
with big zine projects too I literally don't want to know how much I've paid for charms altogether. As usual cady napping on my left, mom napping on my right, except they fell asleep during sunset so I’m deadass sitting in total darkness rn bc my laptop finally died. She said “later today”...it’s 8:30 pm Diane please I just wanna check smth off my to do list . I didn’t really pack for zenkai but I did open and empty the suitcases and move everything to one open area to be more easily sorted/packed later. Making that  pic.twitter.com/vqjs2wjv1L. We’ll be living large in no time . Maybe by then I’ll be able to afford us dessert, but I think we’ll have to share it.. My mom was adopted for this reason! “Happy break!” - my professor, completely seriously after writing 5+ paragraphs of critique and changes to make for next class. Prof: add illustrated elements
Me: (does)
Prof: It looks to much like your pattern. Change it from illustration to a photo.
Me: (tearing my hair out over spring break)

gee whiz it sure is gonna be fun working under an art director someday. Ohhh fuck yes I just had a great (read: simple) idea of how to incorporate some of this feedback. Omg while my mom picked up the food I walked cady to get some air and apparently one of the guys in their was shittalking abt me saying I came on private property to let my dog poop - meanwhile I’m a customer, picked up her poop and litter (2 nips, bottle, plastic bag from tree). I simultaneously sneezed and burped. Aaaa I’m so excited my transparencies arrived - I’ve never been able to print them at home or at this scale - but I can’t do anything yet bc the things I’ll be printing either aren’t ready yet or need to go on items that haven’t arrived yet and need to be measured djdjdhdhdb. Plot twist: they’re secretly vampires. It adds a softness and it’s good for printing bc there’s more contrast between the darker colors and the lines . I’m soo happy I found my Kyo button from @stehpone  before the Fruits Basket reboot screening!!  

(And now that I rewatched I hope I can get my hands on the matching Yuki and Hatsuharu ones someday!) pic.twitter.com/FMDBIZrAWP. He was my fave before and he’s my fave now   Some things don’t change. my comp restarted suddenly, lost the file I was working on, and logged me out of icloud and every website..........th.a..nks???? (do not RT)

twitter help me i'm losing my gd mind pic.twitter.com/oN0b8Tz3hg. Thank you!! I think I've just been looking at it too long@u@;;. Thank  you <3. That can be arranged  
(Thank you for the input! PS Your moth pin is so beautiful!). Yep! Advance surface design. Had to make a scarf based on certain collections at the Harvard Museum of Natural History. I was kinda squicked out by a lot of the taxidermy and creepy-crawlies there but butterflies are beautiful! haha

(me:    ---   you:   ). Scarf \o/. Thank you!! <3. I’m glad I’m going through my print stock now and not right before the con bc it makes me feel Terrible lmfao just so many prints (I lost a box one time..), and so many old prints... hello again #bananafish  twitter 
has anyone cheesed baby ash yet  pic.twitter.com/qpwwcOtVwU. Good luck this weekend! Ok I’m gonna go do some yoga. I need to do yoga again. Saw Captain Marvel! It was rad!! Although we weren’t able to leave before a Man started to give his Opinion. Yes!! I really enjoyed it! I knew nothing going in so it was totally fresh. Ugh yeah he was talking during the movie but I couldn’t hear what he was saying, my friend was closer to him . Uh ok my headache finally went away while I was getting ready for bed?? Like?? Thanks? I guess??? I had a bad dream about bugs
It was yucky
Send tweet. Buhh boobaloo was lonely and making noise so i went to give him treats and pat him and hang out for a few but I’m low key allergic to hay and now I’m all stuffy sneezy fhdjfbf. Ahah it looks so good tho!!  ugh, bye   
Sorry you had a bad experience with an unresolved ending.. Aaa what a colorful set up! Good luck!!  Aaaa it’s been so long since I printed - on fabric too - please wish me luck for tomorrow.... pic.twitter.com/JT6coULH2j. If anyone wants to remind me of screen printing protips feel free but I think I kinda just have to make all the same mistakes again. Also I’m so pleased w these transparencies!! I can print at home/not paying at school, 2” bigger in each direction, and it’s way more black than the laser ones..curious to see the difference when I burn it in. We’re very colorful today!  pic.twitter.com/HoUDbYZy9C. My faded hair is feeling very spring-y but I feel like it could use a light color refresh.. cardboard is so expensive
I know that sounds crazy but
it is. yeah!! Its a pretty orchid color, just maybe a little more hot/pink-y than I want so I was wondering if doing lilac over it would refresh/even it out and cool it down a bit? hmm. Amazing!!! Congratulations you two!! . How did you get this photo of me. Oh god this is reminding me of the squirrels in NH this fall ...there was a bumper crop...and so much carnage. Happens to the best of us. Sleeeeepy...daylight savings + break + unusually frequent migraines equals my ass in bed all day and night. Ok heading in to get a locker and print for the first time in months! Almost a year since printing on fabric... wish me luck!!! Oof all I did was swish my screens and my back hurts lmfao gotta rebuild these . He. I’ll have literally a few of these at #zenkaikon pic.twitter.com/4cxHfuHWOL. Me too . Heheh 
If they sell I’ll be making more for online. I think you know deku, Baku, todo, and kiri are most popular but if u want a Denki then treat yourself!! Or you could make some or all of them smaller and make them pairs? It matches my onesie  pic.twitter.com/96Pv6gS1Um. I constantly pursue the path where I can wear one piece of clothing and be fully clothed. They’re the only one piece pajamas I own. Also proof that these bags are fucking huge. Also hi pic.twitter.com/kORRu4gGk8. GAHH i lost track of time in the studio...I hope I can watch next time!! I destroyed my body today, no exaggeration I didn’t sit down for 8 hours. Lrt y’all this might be it - the most idiotic tweet. Damn now that might be an exchange I’m willing to make ...
/Maybe/. Also wow can’t believe men and only men play soccer and presumably involuntarily and more than once a month. Lrt fucking OUCH. Ah I do not miss the days of tiny puppy bladder   Glad it’s going well and loving all the pics! Yeah I went hard yesterday even tho I’ve lost what little muscles I had built up so I low key have ice packs strapped to my arms rn. You ever see a theory so good you’re like “wow, spoiler alert”. Cambfasine (noice..I have full confidence if I were on a real keyboard tho) https:// twitter.com/mariomanYT_/st atus/1106575634480934913   …. My bro complains about missing Cady’s puppy faze and I’m just like No. The first year is hell but nature made them extra cute then to make up for it . you ever had a good idea but it means you have to redraw one of the drawings you already did so technically you're further behind than you were before. "so what you're telling me is you're even Less done than you were before Spring Break?" - my prof on tuesday probably \o/. Due to the early date, #Zenkaikon  is my first con of 2019 meaning - I'M NOT READY! Be gentle with me  

I'll be there next weekend at table 21- with goodies galore! Meanwhile, you can peep my original + fan merch@ http:// cambrasine.art/shop-all    

See you soon, PA! pic.twitter.com/xiTyghBrYV. On a personal note, Zenk*ikon has previously lined up with some pretty Terrible Times TM - in 2017 dealing with the fallout of my grandma's passing and waiting on pins and needles to hear back about whether we got this house, and in 2018 running in and out on the phone making. sure someone dear to me got the medical attention he desperately needed. Even during the emotional tumult I've found Zenk*i to be one of the chillest conventions with kind attendees, and I'm looking forward to (hopefully) experiencing it without the extra baggage this year!! . As much as I've been really stressed out lately, it's been mostly about schoolwork which despite looming over my daily life is largely inconsequential.. It's hard, but it's important to step back + be like 'hey, remember how fucking awful all that was? you're doing ok right now'. This doordash guy Sucks . It’s been over an hour and he finally got our food but he’s now way off the path to our house and is probably getting someone else’s food too cause he’s near the shopping centers and restaurants.. uhh i was full of tension and anxious energy today and then i ate a big meal and now i'm just. snail's pace. ready for bed. help. been trying to draw for class and polish off this zine piece but i did quite a number on my hands and arms yesterday, particularly my right side, to the point where I ate dinner w my left hand. been listening to very odd bg music..idk much about sub genres but the comments suggest it's...indie dream pop. ? My preview for @FurubaZine  !   I can't wait to go to the theatrical event next week!!
Preorders will be up in a couple weeks, so be sure to keep an eye out! pic.twitter.com/1jHfrZHhdb. THEYRE SO COOL. Maybe I’ll get into P*rtcon someday, like when I’m 45. Same! When I make sets and they’re different sizes I’m like OH NO but no customers have ever cared 
Also Bakugou toast best seller I’m calling it now
I also love all night . Mob feels like a given, after that is Teru, then I’m not sure.. I used to dislike Ritsu but after rewatching I understand him better..but Shou is just so charmingly chaotic LMFAO. esafddhfh omg that episode of ladybug involved lots of yelling@the screen for me . I wanna watch mob but my mom is out so I'm waiting aaaaaaaa
not like I don't have things to do anyway.. Lrt never been big on Shigaraki, but his long hair in the last chapter really suits him. Thank you!! Two cute kids TT A TT <3. me: sorry I couldn't understand your *raspberry* accent 
cady: ((JUMPS THE FUCK UP))
me: IT WAS FOR THE MEME, I'M SORRY---. for context my dog is scared of farts and fart-like sounds, irregardless of whether they are originating from the butt or mouth of herself or anyone else. if she's laying down she'll jump up and run away, but if she's up and you do it sometimes she tilts her head then comes over to you like "OH MY GOD ARE YOU OK WHAT S HAPPENING?!!?" . mp100 spoilers maybe//

y'all does the broccoli appear after this arc? I stopped reading after it appeared bc friends told me everything goes to hell after and I wasnt emotionally prepared lmfaoo. aaa thank you friend!! maybe I'll pick up and finish the manga after this season then bc I really wanna but i'm fucking lazy to figure out where to start back up. Rest in pieces my friend pic.twitter.com/q8gHVqPYRF. lrt me next week when my bro is home and the fruits basket premiere overlaps with a class  \o/. Hey friendos
How is Anim*zement? I got off the waitlist and they give u like 5 mins to decide   my May is wide open but June thru AX is busy and it’s 11 hours away so I’m torn.. Is this not. His job?????? pic.twitter.com/0hY8wVSyfF. Aaa yeah I stopped there on the way back from Georgia last year and it was pretty cool! Just trying to figure out if it’s worth it $ wise/exhausting myself . Alright since my spring break ends tomorrow and I had so much work assigned over I’m gonna take the next hour to take care of myself and take a hot shower and use blackhead strips and cut my nails and whatever. Update pic.twitter.com/7uOUV326i6. W h a t
I use them probably like 3 times a year and turns out I’m a fool and left an empty box in here but 

What. the animation is today's episode again (mp100) was just like..am i watching a MOVIE my goodness its amazing. These look so gorgeous. I think the anime begins airing April 5 (don’t quote me on that) but there’s special movie theatre events on the 26/27. I’d wear this t-shirt . YEP...only that one theatre and one time each day...hence skipping class . Hhhhh I got more sleep than usual why am I so groggy and nauseous  ....I wanna skip / skip my second class but I can’t cause I’m skipping it next weeek hnnnnnnfndjdjddxfvfuck. Me: ooh Beirut is playing
Mom: Are they from Lebanon?
Me: I don’t know, but probably not. I mean, if I made a band in Boston it’s not like I’d name it——wait... Hnhfvjug my prof came over at the beginning of class and said oh you made good progress you can go home if you want and I just drove 45 mins here and my next class isn’t for Four Hours. I'M MAKING THE EXECUTIVE DECISION TO JUST GO THE FUCK HOME I GUESS? I could really use the EIGHT extra hours to clean and pack for Zenkaikon.............. Me: hello I’m not coming today bc I don’t feel like hanging around for 4 hours and I’m not coming next week bc I have to go see anime in a theatre I take my education very seriously. I feel like I have to defend myself bc I tweet about skipping school a lot but I’ve only actually missed 1 class meeting of 1 class this semester thank you. Every class there's a new folder and he emails it out and I'm just here like 'did i  .. miss something'. hnn I can barely remember serizawa's backstory and I thought we'd have gotten it by now but?? maybe soon??  I can't remember aaaa. Screaming my prof included a winking face in this email I’m. Packing for cons is always made more exciting by the deeply buried treasures from the previous con  pic.twitter.com/C8hBGwZTN7. Me: the hole in your pants is really bothering me 
Mom: it’s pretty good though, it doesn’t seem to be expanding...They’re well-made pants 
Me: (gestures wildly) BUT THERE’s A HOLE IN THEM. Hey! Just checking in since I’m packing! Do you still want 20 of these? Bless y’all. Such a sunny little surprise   I read it through (again) then put it in its home on my zine shelf . Hello please buy from me at Zenkai bc I have A Lot of Things and Not A Lot of Money   thanks. Table 21, near the windows! pic.twitter.com/byElsjRwon. Thank you!!! I drew them a while ago but now I'm like I NEED TO ADD SHOU . ...also @mairinette  since u may know LMFAO. I can't believe I didn't know Animaestro was out, I'm so bad at keeping up sometimes!! BUT MARI'S WAITRESS OUTFIT IS SO CUTEEEE I wanna see the cosplays...slash I wanna cosplay ersdgfhf. Aaa  YES! I think so too, I just can't remember which it was.. TT A TT Hoping some more devoted or memory-inclined fan will remember! 
hm, I wonder what kind of milk he'd be :O. OHH YOU'RE RIGHT!!!! There's another moment w Plagg and Mari but I think this was the Big One
Thank you so much!! <3. Ohh, yes, they do!! In The Dark Owl! Thank you!! . Deleted my tweet since I got the answer, thank you friends for sating my curiosity!! <3. High on top of the usual I just dished out so much between tables/lodging for future cons and merch/supplies for this con I’m   let’s get this   this weekend misty!!  . the lady@Dunks was not having it w me today?? I asked if they had choc chip muffins bc they always produce them from some magical place in back + she gestures behind her like “does it fucking look like we have them” +when I ordered 12 munchkins she was like the minimum is 10??? # StrangerThings3. GAH why is stranger things dropping during AX
I feel personally attacked. maybe gonna put my patterns on spoonflower? I guess why not yknow. Eugh! I can imagine it - I worked at a coffee shop in a wealthy town so maybe less insanely busy but more Uppity White People   I only lasted three months.. 

Tricky bastards make ya buy a swatch of each one before ya sell it (makes sense but ouch) but I’ll get to it soon~~. AAA...what a collab . Lmfao I think we’ve all been there tbh. (Shudders) the one I was at wasn’t a big chain but still idk if I could ever work in a coffee shop again. Anyway I just called this scrunchie a French fry and said “what am I gonna bring to Kentucky” when I’m going to PA so I’m just. Gonna take a nap. I think that’s the best idea. Lemme know if there’s a particular one you’re hypothetically interested in since I prob won’t make them of every pattern and color way since it’s like $5+ each. My prof got this for me from the ICA bcc drew dogs for the last project! It’s letterpress, I love the feeling.   from @eggpress pic.twitter.com/xswi6KSSav. Guess who just sprained or broke her wrist. Ok 
I think it’s just sprained 
The minute I take ice off it it swells back up like crazy tho . sgdhfgh Thank you TT A TT. aa thanks Mai!! Luckily some motions (like moving fingers, bending wrist forward) are ok at least!! Fuck I can’t decide whether to go to the doctors before leaving for Zenkai 
I don’t have the time really but uh. My wrist hurts+ it’s settled into that dull pain that may mean it’s broken or maybe not
The internet said wait 2-3 days I’m just nervous cause I’m going out of state. Hello someone give me X-ray vision not bc it’s cool but so I can diagnose myself thanks
I think it’s just sprained but I also said that for several hours about my broken arm so I’m not a reliable narrator. Here lies my plan to set up tonight and enjoy the market near my AirBNB in the morning RIP. Yeah my mom is giving me this shit too lmfao. Scared to find out it is broken, also scared to have the doctor say it’s only a sprain you’re being a baby and wasting time lmfaoo. The lady at the office 15 mins away was super rude so my only option is 30 mins away in the wrong direction that’s gonna take like 2 fucking hours. I will get to PA eventually maybe zzz. Too lazy/busy to reply individually rn but I am Trying to go to the doctor.haven’t left yet. insurance won’t answer the phone til 3:30 bc of some special meeting so idk if I can go to the clinic 5 mins from my house yet, made an apt incredibly inconvenient further later in case. Ok so he looked at the x-rays and said he’s p sure it’s not broken but is sending them to a radiologist to make sure 
He wrapped it for me and when I told him about this weekend he was like “Oookay..”  pic.twitter.com/7VBdCYmn8r. Aaa that’s awesome!! Congratulations! We’re gonna arrive at like 4 am probably . We’re still some hours from the Airbnb but we only ate once today and we found this place that’s open til 3 and ate a giant bowl of pasta and raviolis and I’m ready to pass out lmfaoo pic.twitter.com/FdKKDcurjW. This is so cute what the fuck. Ohh lemme know if you see an unsolved mysteries about uh like a woman can’t get up or is in pain and laying on the couch and a young boy runs in asking her to play but she can’t..and smth abt bees?? cause that’s my brother but I’ve never been able to find it . Yeah he had a short acting career when he was really young   Mostly commercials haha well thank you!! Whoever put the head of this bed directly under this drafty window was a psychopath 
See u in the morning Lancaster. This AirBNB was way cheaper so we switched one of the nights to here from the place we ADORE and I was ok w my earplugs but omg as soon as I took them off the neighbors are?? Screaming at each other? I can even make out the words they’re so loud. Uhh I didn’t reorder my mew mew charms so I only have limited sitcom and this con is TMM crazy it’s only been two hours ... send help. *limited stock. I’d watch that. yessss back in this bougie airbnb . lrt I don't really drink but if I did this would be the situation. I forgot we got our heat/ac units bc of this AirBNB lmfao. Here’s what I had to take off the bed to be able to sleep in it pic.twitter.com/ugcHqJw6o6. dfggfhdh ok hopefully I will take a shower and eat food and drink water and get sleep and be able to function better tomorrow but I actually didn't totally crash til after, which was good zzzz Thanks for being lovely today everyone <3. "CHARMS!!!" - every con goer ever. Can I second this?? Every time I see your insta stories I think wow she’s so beautiful and bold and fashionable and confident!! Also update on the wrist! It’s surprisingly mostly better?! I was really good about not using it + icing it + compressing it for like 36 hours, so now it’s not constantly hurting and only can’t handle certain movements. Just gotta be careful for a bit I’m guessing! Goodnight twitter pic.twitter.com/Lh9Ie5qiLN. Guys 
This bed 
Was so good
I don’t wanna get up. Hey y’all!! 
As you may very well have heard by now I’m at @Zenkaikon  Table 21 this weekend! Here’s what my booth looks like, where I am, and what I’m running low on!!  #Zenkaikon pic.twitter.com/FFFaANTRbQ. Omg how did u get such a nice photo in this dull room?! . I will!!! I have more BF charm ideas too, if only I had the free time !! Omg that’s amazing.  I’ll look forward to it!! Ria no. Omg people buy my screen prints so infrequently that this customer asked for one and I was like “...idk what you’re talking about” before I remembered . ASHDHFKD this guy seemed pissed and gestured and yelled to roll the window down so I did and then he kept yelling very exasperated and getting angrier and I was like “?!? it is down?!” And he was like “Oh. Your taillight’s out.”  . I missed you today Q*K friends!! I hope you had a successful show and I hope I see y’all at anime boston next month!! regardless of whether me getting a last minute table is in the cards or not - I’ll be around! . Glad you had fun and hope you made some  too!! Aaa thank you!  I made that charm and these buttons during season one..I gotta add Shou or make some new stuff soon!! HYPE!!  pic.twitter.com/ml8gFqfdiX. if I see one more person ask if 'anyone else' is cosplaying MHA in the Anime B*ston social group i'm gonna scream
They're giving y'all a whole damn ballroom. ((I know people are just looking for others w the same interests I just feel like I've seen at least half a dozen of these worded like 'oh hey anyone else here even know this series' and the answer is OF COURSE YOU FOOL, ITS WILDLY POPULAR AND YOU SHOULD KNOW THIS *shakes them*)). I wonder if I’d sleep better at home if my bed wasn’t a like 20 year old pile of mush 
I love my crazy soft bed but I’ve slept a lot better these past couple nights on this one and it hasn’t hurt my hips somehow. She’s perfect!!! I literally owned that shirt back then. It had a bunch of strings on each side and tied up the back bc of course it did. I’ll prob b 15 mins late again bc Bed. Sorry I’ll be late not bc of the bed but bc my mom is doing a favor for my uncle rn?! I ??? . My prof who gave me a whole project over spring break now wants to hold class on the day when class is cancelled school-wide. So...that’s a No from me. LRT here til 3:00!! 1-3 left of all of these!!! Send help #zenkaikon  table 21 pic.twitter.com/9iMzAVI74g. I feel like I’m playing on Difficult it’s been soooooo rapid pace busy!!! . Thank you!! Me too, I think I ordered perfectly on most of them . Two vomit .

If you’re wondering how I went so many hours without tweeting it’s because I was violently throwing up in two different states on the 7 hour drive home . My prof said mono, the flu, and stomach flu were going around school and well we know which one I got don’t we. Gonna try eating wish me luck. Teru pairing his or mobs nails?  
Also holy shit this is a cute idea - are u ok if I steal it for a different character sometime?? If anyone needs a ticket to tomorrow’s sold out Fruits Basket premiere (English Dub) at Kendal Square tomorrow, there’s someone on fb who has a ticket! I didn’t end up needing to buy an extra but I though I’d get the word out. Oh. I’ve been sleeping almost all day and I got up to maybe eat my first meal since yesterday and my family totally just left me here lmfao. I wanna watch mob but I feel too yucky. Lrt people who can use comics well are like fucking magicians. When I was in Pennsylvania I got a Boston Cream cupcake that was chocolate cake with chocolate cream and a Plymouth sandwich that had avocodo in it and I have come to the conclusion that y’all know nothing about Massachusetts. just sent my profs the equivalent of 'hey y'all it's been A Week' bc between the wrist injury, con, and stomach flu I didn't get Shit Done so I have nothing to show and I'm taking it easy to rest up after all that and my bro is home for one week only so I'm not going tomorrowsfg. my mom just asked the dog if she's feeling better when i'm getting over stomach bug and my brother's coming down w a cold lmfao. Omg I emailed my prof last night that I was still recovering (not untrue but also Fruits Basket) and he just cancelled class bc he has the stomach bug too I’m. Rude . I was just contemplating this earlier today..you cannot win. Ohmygod...I’m so sorry. I can’t imagine.. Fruits basket premiere was so lovely! The interview at the beginning was really entertaining too!   Can’t wait to watch it this season. My only complaint is the theatre messed up so now my family and I own 6 Kyo buttons, 0 Tohru buttons, and 0 Yuki buttons   @fruitsbasket_en. I mean I love Kyo but... . (About a car on an off ramp)
Mom: what are you doing trying to come on when I’m trying to get off?
Me: what are you doing coming while I’m trying to get off
Mom: dirty mind!!
Me: You got me halfway there....that’s what she said. It’s...expensive. I think the thing is you should really consider the medium when designing it cause sometimes people make enamel pins from designs that really don’t lend themselves to it yknow. Not an exaggeration, please trade with me #fruitsbasket pic.twitter.com/fZC9jekB06. Omg I’m not that style of ita bagger tho :(. Sure!! I’ll DM you? Oops I think I can’t - Dm me? . Yeah - I don’t know that I’ve really done it well either - I was just trying to say it’s a big investment so choose carefully . Excited to see what you make!! . Didn’t have any official merch or cosplay but I still had fun dressing up a little for the furuba premiere tonight  pic.twitter.com/E91JKQAqfI.  thank you!!  oh, you~~. @ stehpone  ! They made Yuki and hatsuharu too! I was feeling better and being so good about not eating too much at once and watching what I ate but clearly I still fucked up bc I had really intense abdominal pains last night and now I’m nauseous again . Hnn what’s a theme for postal stamps designs bc I’ll be stressed until I send a wip, even tho we weren’t supposed to have class this week . yes!! I wanna get the rest of the set sometime!  means a lot coming from the cutest!! cute people telling me i'm cute?!! <3 <3 <3. aaa thank you friend!! I tried doing like 'state birds of new england' but...i'm just not good w birbs ; n; think i'm gonna end up doing like the 5 oceans kind of thing. aaa I know, that's the problem!! too many options haha. aaa well they'll be airing in a week or two so you won't have to wait too long!! It's pretty lovely!! my prof as a general note to everyone on this assignment: try to do something a little different
me: hello yes i like ocean. All I know is my stomach better be better by Friday because my favorite ice cream place in my hometown is open now and I’ve been craving Chocolate Peanutbutter Cup since they ran out last season. Actual email from my school  pic.twitter.com/DCWpRmMqat. I’M DYIN’ my bro came with me to the furuba premiere last night and just now out of nowhere he goes “...I just wanna watch more fruits basket” . Me: The new ones not out yet but we can watch the old one! 
Brother: ehhh but I t’s not nostalgic for me so it’s ..just kinda lame 
Me: :(. Yes, this! I hope you can work things out but if not - i don’t know about your school but for mine the withdraw date is approaching just now, so that may be an option if it feels to impossible or the prof isn’t willing to work w you. Hi twitter do any of you know geometry 
I’ve got this pattern that’s like hexagons arranged in a half drop pattern and we’re trying to figure out like..the formula for the outline based on the coordinates we have for the points on the line ? Or smth like that orz How do. loving bacon transcends species. Cady normally will just beg quietly or hang nearby but if there's bacon left on the table she will stand alone next to it and growl and bark fdgfdh. I love her, but she’s a brat sometimes . I recognize a few of these.. :3 c. I'm late writing back but..would you still wanna trade? * U* I managed a Yuki trade but I'm still missing Tohru!  oh, you~~. lemme know if you're doing a charm order soon friendos. Look at me doing inventory just a few days after a con! Good job, me!! me bullying my brother into watching mp100
bro: (cooking) you gotta put salt on everything! (hand motion)
me: SALT SPLASH - ONE OF REIGEN'S SPECIAL MOVES
mom + me: (laughing)
me: see if you would just watch mob psycho you would've got that
bro: (weak laughter). hnn yeah I'd need a couple diff sizes and the only point of ordering together was sooner cause otherwise i need to make new stuff/sell out of more things or it'll be a tiny order heh. i feel personally attacked bc @chromswaifu  posted goth crocs on fb and i don't have time to draw middle school kirishima wearing them. I am a busy gal  u nu. Before and afters of pizzas we (read: my brother) made last night! pic.twitter.com/iaCSXskArg. after this con season i'm gonna like
take whatever stuff i have leftover that i wanna be rid of and do like
online super sale before school starts back up
discounted print bin went well at Zenkai. grrr my prof always asking me to send her wips then not replying for multiple days so I can't freaking work on the thing!!! >:(. Ohh shit right I should be ordering charms anyway in case I manage a day of table for AB and if not I’ll just have them for Anext. Gah!! That’s so frustrating! Maybe you could ask if you can get enough people together or smth? I got to do like one personal thing in the studio but next up is my zine for class so orz. Felt like it too! I think there’s less to in March than late April/May (finals, weddings, proms, graduations, etc) so it worked out well!   Congrats! My bro is having avocado toast for the second time today. This made my whole family laugh out loud bless u mariessa. @ chromswaifu  fuck pic.twitter.com/y2pwJ3JkLt. I gave him the key ring from Tokoyamis room ..I wanna color sometime . about to?? paint a mural on my bros wall?? wish us luck?? Jk Rowling reveals that you have to do it haha https:// twitter.com/9GAG/status/11 11116451782557697   …. This guy almost T-boned us but came to a complete stop...then he whipped around us passing on the right in the bike lane and slammed his mirror into ours . Bro leaves tomorrow :( sad. My wisdom teeth hurt . Lrt I had this happen to me a lot in the miraculous fandom,,, like 50-300 likes vs 2-6k . From yesterday pic.twitter.com/n6qRMd6voQ. I’m crying pic.twitter.com/c19fUunBaP. Guhh the airport makes me so nervous all the time. Aaaa so adorable. i've been avoiding the new version of photoshop but...being able to preview the layer setting by hovering over it in the menu instead of having to click on each one to see..that is...very good. seriously...and also holding shift to not keep the size proportional when transforming instead of the other way around... a good change.................but my tools are in the wrong goddamn spots. YEAH no I agree, i just think it makes more sense to have that as the default, but i'll be fucking it up too orz. There were goth crocs on my feed and I *had* to draw middle school Kirishima in them   feat. the keychain from Tokoyami's dorm room that confirmed Goth!Kiri is canon
#bnha  #KirishimaEijirou pic.twitter.com/crtYgsf5jm. https://www. instagram.com/p/BvSV3koBIUd/    Here are the crocs in question - they're $240+ in case you were wondering - and a bonus shoutout to @midimayo  for bringing them into my life via her fb feed, please check her art out! . Thank you, I feel so validated. me: ah I love this..I also would've loved it...in 2009. if these furuba charms come to fruition (pun intended) they'll be the most self indulgent things lmfao .... I gotta switch gears bc i've actually had a really nice week of?? skipping class, getting on a better sleep schedule, going for hikes in new places, just hanging out w my dog and family and playing games and cooking and laughing and..now my bro went back home and I have HOMEWORK. i've been struggling this school year with *constantly* thinking about classwork - like anxiety/obsessively - and it was nice to not obsess for like 5 days but uh now i have to..do the things i didn't do all week..wumpwamp. Honestly I don’t hate them..the pink platform crocs too ..  but yes! Thank you for the inspiration hahah.  I try haha. I AM GLAD U APPROVE. I feel like I’m in new territory..is this a meme art or a shitpost . AB? . You’re welcome friend.  aaa thank you! I’m glad I did him justice. MWUAHAHA THANK YOU THANK YOU. It took me longer than I would like to admit to figure this out . I can’t wait til this semester is over..just one more month but so much to do. Woah my prof told me don’t come to class tomorrow and make test prints instead ...that sounds...better bc I have to do that anyway ......wish I could make them during class but there’s a screen class then . Nana this is beautiful. Me: I’ll stay with these good habits even when my bro isn’t home!!
Day 1:
me: (migraine and school anxiety, depressed as shit, in bed at 2 pm even tho I went to bed at 11)
me: fuck. I had a nice dream where I was taking a bath in a house on a beach and the window was open and a wave came thru and splashed into the bathtub and I was like “oh, cool, saltwater is good for you”.  too kind! My friend tagged me in light up Christmas crocs once too for Kirishima but I didn’t have time then, so I jumped on this opportunity haha.  thank you friend!! Hmm gonna wait a bit longer but torn between going blonde again or refreshing the purple...I think there’s enough time for another dye and fade round before swimmy season. CITRA....this comment is too sweet..it must be an april fools joke . YES. These. i always forget that i consider a half a bagel a bagel so really every bagel is two bagels. we walk it back and patch things up

How was I not gonna draw that crop top boy LMFAOO <3 <3 <3. I haven't seen promised neverland -- i haven't because I heard that was scary and I'm bad w horror too - but ERASED is more like mmm mystery. u ever think you're doing really well at not falling for shit on April Fools Day then someone you love says they're going to move to another country haha...yeah that was super funny...good one...........pleasestop. I just nearly sat on my dog's face by accident and she had absolutely 0 reaction and she's just still sleeping... Shfhshsh thank y’all so much for the love on this..this may be my most popular post ever   Kirishima deserves all the love!!! Oh. I had a good idea. Lrt I feel attacked. this IS SOOOOO CUTEEEEEE. Excuse me weather app April fools was yesterday I s2g pic.twitter.com/v4CzoGI5hv. Gotta love that New England weather. I’m fucking. My mom was worried about her bro who is struggling w addiction and he finally calls her after days and goes “what.” Not even hello. I . Dhndhfndbd.  wishing you a swift recovery nana!! Casually fucks everything up. Hahah honestly I’m not very hip - I don’t watch a ton of anime somehow.. that’s good info tho - maybe I need to get on promised neverland then!! Thank y’all . Anyway we’re learning photoshop today. pic.twitter.com/J4XFN35WRl. Me when I forget Kiri’s scar. THIS IS SUCH A PERFECT MATCH I’m dyin. I’m bored out of my mind we’re talking about the different selection methods ...can I test out of the next four weeks LMFAO. I want cookies from the vending machine but I only have $1 in cash I bet they’re 1.25 or 1.50 :(. Jdbsbwhw honestly. My prof said I was doing senior level work and I was like yeah tell administration that bc my credits don’t reflect it . LRT WHY IS THIS HAPPENING AGAIN. Lrt I’m never sure if I want to Be or to marry s*ra k*pin. Wow after being pretty relaxed for a week I forgot what full fledged anxiety mode feels like..even if nothing stressful is happening at school it’s just this feeling in my stomach fhdndhd. “When did I last have my period?” - me, every month. Good day in the studio! Had to leave bc it was starting to get busier before the next class, but a solid start on my test prints! pic.twitter.com/utg3Sf7b6z. OH! I missed it, but I’ll be at AX!!  These designs are gorgeous - two of my faves collabing is a dream come true!! The guy next to me was on his phone even tho this is the “quiet car” and man spread and kept his bag up on the seat meanwhile I’ve got my screen leaning on my knees, a bag on my feet, and my backpack on my lap   Why aren’t men conscious of how much space they’re taking up. Somehow this confirmation code perfectly sums up how I’m feeling rn pic.twitter.com/ZtxEqkSC3h. My prof cancelled our second to last project so now we have??? 5 weeks of self directed project(s)? What the hell am I gonna make?? Ohmygod . This is surface design btw aka literally something for anything so . HMU with those good good ideas bc I have None. GWAHH this was a really nice comment TT A TT Thank you Jess!! This project is def a bit different and out of my comfort zone so I hope the finished version is well received! It's been a struggle all semester but it's starting to come together! aaa this is a good method!! Thank you for sharing it! <3 <3 <3. (Mock) postal stamps for Surface Design!
I went with marine life again oops pic.twitter.com/94xRZVzZP9.  thank you dani!!! Hi(re me to draw vaguely accurate blobby sea creatures). Have you watched Oofuri? Aaaa thank you nini 
crying cause you can buy real USPS stamps w your design on them but the site is super broken . The dumbasses building this shit are naming the new road Bluebird Way...never in the year and a half I’ve lived here have I seen a bluebird..Hawks? Owls? Cardinals? Robins? Doves? Yes. Bluebirds? No.  yeah we’ll see. i'm cryin cady is so full of energy and fiesty and happy to see me meanwhile i'm so tired from yesterday and theres 20 mph winds outside. Haven't seen much talk about this but St*renvy is raising their marketplace commission from 10 to 15%. They added a slider so you can mark up your prices accordingly which is nice I guess but in the end either the shop owner or the consumer is losing money on it. This is why I made my website.. Financially it didn't make sense but being in control is nice bc these third party sites can change their policies at any time and leave you spiraling - this is one example, or like how Ti*tail made their marketplace mandatory and then closed, etc. Also this increased mark up begins APRIL 9TH - they gave less than one week's notice - so be sure to make your decision by then: mark up your prices to transfer the cost to your customers, take the financial hit, or spend many hours moving your whole damn shop somewhere else . me: can you do me a favor?
mom: water?
me: yeah
mom: you want it in a cup?
me: no just pour it straight into my hands please. hnn I think that's the wisest choice..or E*sy but E*sy pulls some shit too tbh and you can't make your website pretty at all, it's very annoying..I like b*gcartel too and it's free for 5 items or under which is great for zines but for a whole shop it's too expensive > A<. yeah :(  there's pros and cons to everything but it's so frustrating when third party sites are like "ok, ok, is everyone here now? great - you can all go fuck yourselves!". :(. As for me I'm considering adding 5% mark up to make it the 10% loss I was used to, but it shouldn't affect anyone going to the custom storefront still, and My site doesn't charge you Any bullshit fees so!! USE THAT!! please i'm tryna do you a favor LMFAO. and I should stop being shocked but every single time I get immensely frustrated lmfao. It’s frustrating that these big companies are charging small businesses and independent artists more, but I also get annoyed because I don’t want to transfer those costs to y’all! I’m so appreciative of your support, you don’t deserve that!   /end thread (probably). yeah, better than people who moved their whole shit from storenvy to tictail to etsy lmfao. Hmmm well monthly fee (cost depends where you use and if they have promos) and the one I use doesn’t integrate w the site I use for shipping so I have to manually enter orders in. If I paid for my shipping side I could export to a csv and import batches easily tho. And you have to direct all your traffic but I found that like 90% of my sales on Storenvy were self directed traffic anyway. Yay!! My package from my trade w @notfullymetal__ arrived! Now I’ve got a set! pic.twitter.com/c11DQVgfOJ. no worries!! I’m so happy we were able to work this out! omg!! I just did his very basic school uniform but I love how you went full throttle in dressing him..ripped skinny jeans and layered tees... i'm 12 again.  YES!! oh god I'm so scared for AX..there's gonna be so many people to meet!! aa Thank you so much for the support!! I'm glad they arrived safely . I understand completely!!   Now I wish I'd drawn him with like. a studded belt. or arm warmers. Omg when we get there in the anime  next fall/winter we’ll get sooo much fan art! College isn’t part of everyone’s path and I’m mostly going rn bc I don’t know what else to do. Your decision is totally valid, and you can always go back later if you change your mind. You’re very skilled and I’m sure you have a bright future!! I hope you get hired to work on cool things soon! And about CTC - True fans will care about the wellbeing of the creator and the long term life of the series anyway!!  . may have tweeted this before but I really can't get over mens pajama pants just being fucking open on the crotch like when are you in such a rush to whip your dick out that you can't even pull down your pants?? if you pee doesn't it risk getting pee on them? I don't understand. ((this came up bc I'm wearing my brother's old pajama pants and according to my mom there's a spider *somewhere* in this kitchen and I joked that he's gonna crawl in there)). mom, to a spider on the ceiling: hey hey I just saw your cousin over there
me: what the--- mom how many spiders live in the kitchen?! they definitely are and it's insane. kickstarter idea: crotchless panties but they aren't sexy they're just for equality. EXCEPT NO ONE WANTS THAT BECAUSE OF COURSE THEY DONT?! SO WHY DOES MENS UNDERWEAR WORK LIKE THAT>??? AND PANTS EVEN. IMAGINE WOMENS PANTS HAVING A FLAP LIKE THAT YOU CANT RIGHT BECAUSE ITS CRAZY. RIGHT like I imagine you could already just pull your penis out through this hole right here but the fact that there's a /button/ so you can go FULL OUT is just crazy. my theory is that they do and they don't give a shit. evidence: every toilet i've ever seen and the surrounding areas
like damn how long do you need to have that thing to know how to aim you've had it for DECADES. lmfao that's ok i'm just yelling over here anyway. that is a fair point but yeah, I think it's inevitable u nu. Thank you, I had 2 minutes of INTENSE PASSION on this subject. been really good about not half-assing, genuinely trying to make good portfolio work but i'm getting rly tired + i'm about 2 seconds from pretending the enamel pins i sketched in summer are from this week, finishing 1 for class+then never making it bc no one buys my enamel pins+$. mom: (looking@my inventory spreadsheet)
mom: what is "1+bag?"
me: well there's a bag somewhere and I have to find it to count it. THIS IS VERY SAD. pic.twitter.com/IGthLE51rh. OH NO THIS LOOKS SO GOOD. you're welcome friend, I know you were just waiting for my validation pic.twitter.com/PRuZPqM4rz. obsessively checking the A*B forums about their day-of table procedures this year since they're not inclined to reply to e-mails . me: phew I worked for a whole 30 minutes..tIME FOR A BREAK. you ever just remember the band flyleaf. All Around Me just started playing in my head. Did that thing where I said hi to someone who I vaguely knew but was actually excited to see the person behind me rip. My back....ouch...yeah this whole “finish it next week” plan is feeling more legit   first layer of the back tho!! pic.twitter.com/7uPR4KwmTo. Ngl I didn’t give a shit about the Jonas Brothers back in the day but Sucker is catchy af. I forgot how absolutely sexy it is being able to feel the ink on top of the paper ......screen printing is a good printing method....

if this sounds insane then you clearly haven't touched a screen print. ok apparently we're doing my mom's bucket list trip (Grand Canyon) in combination with my brother's conference in AZ and my convention in CA so hopefully i'm gonna be fit as fuck for AX. Lrt I love how there’s no context but everyone knows it’s Reigen and that’s very funny. Cady loves the beach! pic.twitter.com/1PWr1Muqkm. Omg is this at Logan?! Oh!! a bit unexpected! haha yes, please keep us posted (and safe travels!!). Going to get prof and class feedback so this may not be the final choice but I tried painting the pink on the screen and pulling blue over it and whether it’s right for the project or not you can’t deny it looks funky as hell pic.twitter.com/cZsfceOjgT. Hiding? pic.twitter.com/iBFbhVqXXD. It’s so cute!! Good luck with the pink. whenever someone tweets smth like this it always make me wonder if we're looking at the same thing . @ grimmfirefly. Some pretty mushrooms pic.twitter.com/A5YgRg5eam. Lmfaoo I remember going back and forth with my charm agent abt matsuri Todoroki bc she could not understand why it was wrong . existential crisis folding test prints. I seriously think we went back and forth like six times with lots of image attachments  
LMFAOO NIE ...THAT's..THATS VERY KIND BUT WHAT LOTS OF PEOPLE MAKE CHARMS. SO MANY OHMYmgodgnfhg. Tfw you move over so hyper little kids aren’t running around near your dog who isn’t good w kids and then the kids are like LETS MOVE OVER too . Kiri in crocs? Oh, it’s canon unfortunately  pic.twitter.com/bgUQrzA1Yg. Can’t believe you’d attack me like this. What a gorgeous color! I love. Lrt all my kawaiikon friends who have been blessing my tl with photos of those little crabs all weekend: just wanna say please tell yourself and each of those little guys thank you . I have had several people specifically seek him out, but generally he and Ochako get returned the most when I do the gachapon . if i make this merch for class i'll have to explain maid cafes to my prof probably,.... Ouch ok typically my anxiety doesn’t manifest in the form of nail biting but I did that and ripped one too short last night..so shout out to those of you who struggle with this always cause that must be really shit. just finishing up the final drawing for this cursed zine i'm not crying you're crying. just criticized Cady bc she loves the banana flavored (dog) yogurt but won't eat an actual banana and then I realized that's me and grapes... It’s so wild how what I’ve been consuming most recently affects my drawings.. I redraw my OC over and over throughout a sketchbook and if I’ve been looking at Horikoshi’s work she’ll be slightly thicker and if I’ve just watched Miraculous Ladybug she’ll be stick thin . AU where I know where the fuck my school ID is ever. HA! I thought “I bet it’s in the pocket of the pants I couldn’t find earlier today,” then immediately found the pants and, consequently, the ID. Had a nightmare where Joey picked me up from school and went through a red light and drove us into oncoming traffic by accident and we were fine but so many other cars were involved I was too scared to check on the others ..so anyway here I am, ready to start the day . I also had a dream that I made s shitpost smth like this on a side account and it got 2k+ likes and a reply that said “idk what this means but it’s beautiful”:
I got da black and white one. Hnn the nightmare also followed my the events after that (calling my mom, breaking down in the print studio and getting red ink all over myself, Joey being really cavalier about the whole thing, etc.) so it was ..a lot. Dndhshnsdn thank you for this sweet reply   it was probably just bc I’m so nervous for today..but it didn’t put me in a good headspace to take it on   BUT ILL BE OK!! Thank you!! Ps idk if I’ve said this before but your art is really beautiful. Ohhh if you like Glass Animals I’d recommend Still Woozy! I’ve only listened to Habit and Wildcat so far but..very similar vibes . The hottest new highlighter . even tho I only skipped 1 class I have only been to this class once since February due to his absences + spring break so I wanted to skip today but it felt too wild. i'm all for it but was it not just portfolio day 5 minutes ago? am i losing it? Ash... 
 pic.twitter.com/PQhjAdLIoH. I wanna say about 3/4 of my class isn’t here lmfao welp. i feel bad only me and one other are paying attention but I know photoshop already...it's relaxing tho. .....interesting layout change....................................(i'm sorry). Today was a lot of wasted time. I thought I’d get to start screen printing but since I had to clean up after whoever was there I was going to be too rushed so I did nothingdhdndjdb. This is such a cute idea!! Um ok lady across from me just lit up on the train
She did say it was her first time on the train but I feel like this is..an obvious thing?? i'm like. this close to having a (second) breakdown about this hahaha.......why....I thought I tested this when the paper arrived like a month and a half ago...and my prof keeps telling me it'll be fine but I can't get it right so?! yeah, I've been doing that but I'm new to it....the less creased one I did just now by /aggressively/ scoring but that's..the best I can do so far......................... orz. like. I'd say the paper is too thick but I tried it on 10 lb lighter text weight version of this same paper and iT STILL BUCKLED JUST THERE ergjrseitdhfDGH? IS IT THE PAPER? IS IT ME? I' m losin i t fellas. aaa interesting..I'll try that;; It's hard bc it folds in different directions..it's a weird fold with the paper in eighths;;. Thank you for your help!! TT A TT <3. yeah I used a bone folder and ruler every time, scored every fold every time....and the most recent time I ran them over hard like 4 times and even used a blade super lightly on those two parts.................. i'm dead inside. yeah u nu 11 x 17 folded three times.....IT CAN BE DONE..maybe not with this paper or by me but---- I have seen it pic.twitter.com/BE87OtY0mr. THank you!! I'll keep trying!! Ahh, no -- the 2nd fold is fine -- it's only of the 3rd (final) fold that the paper is like ' I CANT DO THIS '. it is a mystery . uhh I scored them all, then folded..maybe it'd be more accurate if i did them one at a time.. ohh i started watching kaze ga tsuyoku fuiteiru (help what's the abbreviated name for this) and I've been doing the thing where I just keep going even if I'm not hooked and now that Kakeru's getting all angsty again i'm like OH . ahh yeah, my other friend suggested the folding thing too so I'll give that a go;; I need to turn in a minimum of 10 and i'm gonna print like 30 so HAHA..HOPEFULLY I CAN FIGURE SMTH OUT IN TIME..I'm using up a lot of my extra sheets doing this haha. also the music and first imagery in the ED is so pretty. oh that abbreviation sounds cute!! > U<
HAHA WELL I'M WATCHING IT MOSTLY BECAUSE OF YOU! I made sure to skip those insta stories recently since I planned on watching it and didn't wanna see spoilers
AHHH honestly that's a tough call..I think I need longer to meditate on my fave. OHh you know I was humming it and I was like 'it kinda sounds like that one song from BNHA' so that makes a lot of sense!!! I just finished episode 7 where they went to the track meet and it looks like Kakeru is about to make a big fuss next episode lmfao. in real life i'd be more of a realist/pessimist but watching the show i'm always yelling@him like 'stop being a downer you lil baby and just have fun running'. my prof just keeps saying it'll be fine which at first was really reassuring but now that I've had many failures ITS LIKE GODDAMNIT KATE WHY DON'T *YOU* FOLD IT THEN  . thank you for the good luck and thank you for trying to help aaaa. my mom on the paper issues: oof this one's even worse..
me: yeah I did that trying to fix it. maybe..i'll give it a go;;
gahh me neither bruh i'm trying everything and anything,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm gonna try everyone's suggestions TT A TT Thank you!! <3. !!! are you tabling at AB? If so I’ll be by..to buy . GUH this reminded me - I knew someone who did smth like this in high school..our friends were going to go on a trip to celebrate graduating but on gofundme framed it like she was going over to volunteer. It was SHITTY. Some people can be so bold in the worst possible way. This train seat is 
Bizarrely firm. Also these guys were screaming at each other and I was like uh oh but I think it was the train guys joking and yelling to each other since the trains were there at the same time. this is the most amazing thing I’ve read all week. Omg I misread Massachusetts Cannabis Control as Cannibal Control . My classmate is always looking at clothes next to me aaaa look at this one * Q *  https://www. dazeyla.com/collections/bo dysuits-jumpsuits/products/overalls-dancing-ladies   …. Phew! Two layers down! You’re probably like Jenn didn’t you already do that but those were test prints - this was the full edition. I did 5 in blue just for kicks pic.twitter.com/fpTEY4FkZn. It’s that point in the semester where I’ve had 4 hours of sleep and haven’t eaten yet today . Lrt I’ve gotten this question from several people and HONESTLY LIKE WHAT THE HECK DO I KNOW I’ve been doing this for years, and I literally agonize over these numbers every time I place an order I would never wanna be responsible for someone over or under ordering bc both SUCK. there’s so many factors that affect sales - not just attendance - and like..for example at a con TMM was popular so I ordered a lot for the next year+barely sold any..then the year after that they nearly sold out. You can try to quantify things but it’s completely unpredictable. I’ve sold more at some 3-5k cons than some 20-50k cons so. Just guess and die like all of us . isn’t this new one just the same as the old hero one plus more teeth and sleeves?!   ...yet I want it still. When you're going thru the A*B artist alley listing and there's a tracer... I don't wanna be That Guy who sicced people on them so I DM you . I think I'm not going Anim*zement ..only have a few cons for the year so it's sad but flying is more $ but 2 days of driving is $ too with extra hotel nights + pet care days...but I have Anext a couple weeks later and a couple weeks after that AX..I wanna have time to re..lax...? asdfghj chris...!! THIS SOUNDS SO FUN BUt..!! ..I'm gonna be gone for 3 weeks of June, and I feel like I should carve out some time to chill after school..also I'd still have to get to NJ   Maybe we can do smth like this in the future tho! . ahahah no, no, like tracing over official art and selling it;;. Jennie is the magical girl.

The endings are romance based tho ahahha. ALSO HOW IS SURVIVING A DISASTER THE GOOD END??? THAT'S STILL NOT GREAT. did that thing where i took a nap at a stupid time and now i'm here. ready for my 100th complaint about school/fatigue?
literally all of my classmates showed up today with not even a sketch of what they planned to do - just an idea - but since I had a wip already I just have to do /even more/ for next week and so on it's unfair and i want to sleep. Yeah they really need to screen better..slash at all . S...sleep tweeting............. I find myself literally liking and then immediately unliking posts for this reason. Big mood friend. Detective Pikachu Trailer: Limited Edition Pokémon Cards
Me, out loud: holy shit, I want special Pokémon cards!
Me: ...god I’m easy. The only good thing I got out of my years of private school was learning how to type well. my mom has a bad habit of asking me questions about shows I ALSO HAVEN'T SEEN like we're watching and 
mom: who's that guy
me: idk
mom: does he know him
me: that's implied
mom: is he like, a reporter?
me: mom I don---
mom: or like ..a drunk? what was he saying to him?
me: Mo---. Here’s my dog eating ice cream a few days ago pic.twitter.com/U60bhNzGJY. pic.twitter.com/rdIl1Xpti7. The New England weather has its ups and downs...mostly downs . My list of artists to visit at AB is so long !! alright i've reached the point where I am literally going to bring in a sheet of paper and ask my prof to fold it without it wrinkling so she'll understand how cursed it is. ahah i'm glad someone understands my suffering. but I'm gonna print most of it before that so if we can't figure it out then everything will be a waste hahaha..ha... I sent her a 2 AM email like HEY I CANT PRINT MUCH NEXT WEEK SO IM TRYING TO DO IT RIGHT NOW BUT I DONT WANNA DIE PRINTING SIX LAYERS ON THESE IF THEY WONT FOLD AND BECOME A BOOK SINCE THIS CLASS IS 'MAKE A FUCKING BOOK' and i'm Stress. Hnn yeah It's crossed my mind..The only problem with that is like..it's hard to explain but the whole reverse side is a poster..so the poster would just have...a big cut in it.... yeah...maybe I'll go do that to one of my test prints rn and see how I feel about it;; I'm running out of extra paper to test fold LMFAO Thank you for trying to help!! I appreciate it. THIS TWEET IS SO OMINUS ... Happy birthday!!   I hope you have a lovely (and safe) day! She gave me some advice about how to proceed and said she’ll bring some speciality bone folders but she was p much like “we have to accept the limitations of the paper but still print your book bc the content is good” . Yeah :( I think she probably will when showing me the special tools...it’s just so frustrating bc like the form of the book (the way it starts small and gets bigger as you page through it! informed the content and now that it won’t fold right I’m like . Oh.  my. god. Just laying in bed at 1 pm basking in the pure irony of how issues with creating a zine about anxiety/depression/being overwhelmed have made me experience those same feelings. Mmm I should probably decide how I'm gonna write my name professionally..I don't really like Jennifer but..sigh....also there's more people w my name so I should use either R. or R. G. in the middle but..it doesn't look cute LMFAO. sCREAMINHfghf. this is clearly the only solution thank you for your guidance. ..maybe we all just internalize dislike for our own names. WOAH!! It really does look amazing!! . Jeeeeesus Christ ok done for the night finally ...that was full of struggles, finished off by the fact that someone watered down the emulsion remover to the point where it literally did not work after several minutes of scrubbing and sitting so I had to find the big jug. Ohmygodjfbf. Business in the front party in the back  pic.twitter.com/ECL32G3IoW. Ps help?  Summer is coming and i intend to be in the sun and swimming a lot but there’s still Some time before it’s that warm. Ohh, this is a good tip! I mostly swim in lakes and the ocean tho so chlorine isn’t a problem, just I’ll be washing it after cause it’ll get yucky . I want to look at kazetsuyo fan art but I’m only halfway thru :(. Gahhh I will!! I only saw one piece of fan art on my feed since I started watching and it was horny not spoilery so that was funny   Heck yes!! I’ll keep ya posted on my progress . It’s good to get fresh air, exercise,  and rest! . Aa it’s senior show time of year! I’m in classes with a lot of seniors rn so I can see them dying but it looks so fun to make pieces, hang them together with your friends/classmates, have an opening and give away and sell things! The illustration opening is Thursday night which is perfect bc I also have to go to AB badge pick up so I’ll do it in one swoop! . Hnn it gives me such yearning tho! My family ended up at the illustration senior show the April after I gave up on traditional high school and got my HiSET and by the following September I was enrolled in the illustration program! I don’t think I’ll make it to graduation tho.. He’s fast. You ever accidentally click on a fb as and realize you’ve just cursed yourself forever. I’m screaming does this guy know that those master paintings he can think of were commissioned by the church and the wealthy  I’m —. most of my swimsuits are tiny XS/S/A-Cup things from high school, this bathing suit i love sold out AGAIn but now its on other sites, but only tiny sizes!(seriously what are y'all doing having only XXS-S) I splurged, got the biggest size@a place that allows returns so we'll see. only like two of my bathing suits were acquired since hs and the old ones barely fit the last couple years and now l put on weight so I like. REALLY really need new ones..rip. Me: I have too many too small swimsuits
Me: buys a swimsuit that’s probably too small. It’s so cool tho...I want the rainbow one too but maybe I’ll see if I have to return this one then I’ll get that one instead since it’s still available bigger I think  pic.twitter.com/pIfsmp8UY1. Lazy Oaf!! It’s a UK brand! I just found it, a lot of their apparel involves illustration it’s great! I want 1000 things but it’s kinda pricey . Yeah   I just bought this one thing after much pining..even secondhand stuff from them is still pricey . me: I'm gonna take today off from schoolwork and draw smth for myself!
me: ........
me: .............
me: (about to open schoolwork). remember when I made most of a bakusquad comic then didn't finish it. since I wasn't feeling motivated to start anything I found another old drawing I started in August and never finished of my self-insert magical girl oc I made when I was in 5th grade ...so I'm having fun revamping that drawing now!! should be done tonight. ScREAM my mom said 'HES GONNA CRY' about Haiji and then I said 'IM GONNA CRY' AND FUCKIN CRIED AND THEN /SHE CRIED/
damn go watch kazetsuyo friends. gah!! Please take care of yourself now that it's over!! DRINK A LOT OF WATER. CAN YOU BREATHE.. Print resolution always cause hey - ya never know! For charms I usually do that size and add an inch in all directions, for other illustrations I usually I start 5x7 but end up making it bigger to 8x10 or 11 x 14. Im SWEATING 
How is it so warm in here after one (1) 75 degree day?! i got up really late by accident so now i'm like GREAT TIME TO POST ART but actually it's 1 AM. This is the pinkest thing I've drawn  
I found a drawing I started in summer but never finished of my self-insert #magicalgirl  OC from 5th grade, so I decided to finish it! Well, I p much restarted it..ANYWAY here she is..
Bonus: Cuppy (my most prized posession) as her companion pic.twitter.com/68FIwvgprC. Aaa thank you Belén!! Also - not the same outfit - but @grimmfirefly  and I were dying last night looking through our old accounts so here’s some Naomis from a simpler time (I’m guessing 2008-10 ish)...if you thought my style is inconsistent NOW then just look at these   keep drawing, kids! pic.twitter.com/6d2pzo3Tb5. I planned a fun day followed by work but my sleep schedule is so off that I’m so tired I’m gonna cut out all the fun stuff and just keep the work stuff uhh. Breakfast pic.twitter.com/JWMn2HklpW. Ok I’m getting up before I lose my mind any more. DAMN I FUCKED UP I should’ve written “breakfast in bed”. We will become one. I need his energy and motivation. I think SNL posted it. Ah my bad they posted it but as a five second video..you could probably rip it using some site tho. I made the mistake of doing this and was like “13 whole people blocked Me” and then questioned my entire existence in an attempt to identify what it was that causes them contempt. If all goes well I’ll be done printing this zine tonight and done folding it Tuesday and maybe then I can take a deep breath . This guy tries to build a nest in our porch light every year - we seriously have to take it down every day for a couple weeks. I just hung up our bird house tho so maybe he’ll take the hint pic.twitter.com/nTNCJR72wc. Y’all what’s that show this season everyone was excited for w the guy w the scar on his head(if I’m remembering any of that correctly?). Ohh no but I know that’s really popular !! Yess it def is!! Thanks you two!! I’m finishing up another series now but I’ll keep it in mind for sure!!  . Yessss thank you! Aaa I’ll definitely check it out soon!! Oops *. Final screen burned   not sure if my name/date came out since it was so thin but we shall see... Ran out of time to cut them down idek if I like them fuck I’m tired. Me: when I finish printing this I’ll feel relieved!
Me, done printing, clearly having looked at it too long: i...hate it??? you should be able to set how sensitive your passwords are
like if it's a capitalization or one special character off it should just let you in. tfw its kiribaku week but it's also
finals. aa I'm at the part in KazeTsuyo where they start the Hakone Ekiden and the Boston Marathon is tomorrow and it feels cool that they're lining up ahah. omg i was watching the video of a song I loved when I was young and the comments are all 'hey this guy teaches english at my school now' ARDOGJSFDFH. YOU KNOW IVE BEEN DROWNING WHEN I DIDNT READ BNHA YET. Maybe there’s two cause I remember it being October too?! Sometimes I think about doing commissions again but then I try to price myself and realize that since I’m slow at drawing it’s probably not worth my time vs the amount someone would be willing to pay. GUH! I hate those ones that are like not bad enough to take medicine or drop everything and try other remedies for, but bad enough to just kinda hang over you all day and make life harder
I hope it passes soon! <3. also one of my favorite artists has opened for commissions like three times in the last couple months and I’ve restrained myself each time so I get a gold star for making responsible adult decisions or. The third seems most accurate but I think it's always good to consider how you think each would look with your skin tone too! Also like I’m a picky bitch so I’d love to have my pick of the litter but I don’t think I’d get enough requests to do that   should probably focus on what I want to draw since I’ve been kind of restricted in school. Oof in that case I’d say focus on school unless you’re really desperate for money because failing classes will cost you way more $ than you’d make . Yes!! It can be good to get feedback or validation from outside sources!! . hi I've never done AX before can any vets tell me if I did the thing I needed to do by today
It was just the 'approve your listing' thing with company info or more? oh wait i think i need to do the second thing too... AX: what percentage of your work is fan art and what percentage is original
me: is this a test. A**X is literally so fucking crazy if you don't buy your assistant badges by my birthday it goes up to ONE HUNDRED SIXTY DOLLARS my god what have I gotten myself into. is this the 'seat me next to my friends' section or does it mean smth else? pic.twitter.com/exF9Z1rlpC. LMFAOo too bad they specified a number out of 100 . Omg that would’ve been a good April fools joke... my mom was enjoying making boner jokes while I used my bone folder - 2 part tweet

mom: the last bone fold..the last boner
me: a post-apocalyptic film where they're trying to repopulate but the guy dies, the last boner
mom: sounds like a porno
me: oh, I was thinking regular movie. me: but it may work better as porn
mom: my daughters making corn--- I mean porn
me: CORN--
me: that's a whole different porno, where they use corn in ways you couldn't even imagine
mom: I'm all /ears/
me: aSDFGTDhfgjhgfj. Aaa oh no!! Doing a con when you’re sick is the worst! I hope you can rest up and feel better soon! Just feeling so awful about myself and my art lately can someone tell my where the RESET button on my self confidence is please. Ah, i can see the alibaba listing now... “HOT Anime My Hero Academia BNHA Popular All Might Superhero America Manga Bread Toast Acrylic Plastic Keychain Charm”. SO CUTE. Ahaha I’ve seen a few listings in my time . Generally AB is pretty reliable!! Ohh class is out early...I could work on stuff for my other class...or I could just...roam around...zzz. lmfao god like two weeks of intense worrying and it boiled down to my prof saying the wrinkles didn't really bother her and that she doesnt think they take away from the imagery
so. also I applied to sell at a student art sale at my school (Cambridge, MA) next Wednesday from 3-7 though it looks like we're being assigned one hour time slots? I'm..not really sure how it works, but I'll keep ya posted.. Shrug emoji pic.twitter.com/qjoR3gFWve. trying to focus in class but some commuter friendly person gave me free cookies and i just
want to eat them
so badly
but computer lab. I relearned how to make gifs in photoshop in class tho so that's good! I meant to reteach myself that anyhow. Lrt classic a*b. MAY BE TOO LATE but throwing some kids at you anyway pic.twitter.com/AzZu0MxSJw. You ever see a misunderstanding happening and you’re just like if I could insert myself into this situation I could easily explain the source of confusion to both sides. My prof said make a 3 second gif and an animation major was like THATS 90 FRAMEs but my prof kept showing short animatics (like not fluid) and like simple fluid .5 second gifs as examples and they like were almost yelling at each other by the end it was stressful ... making one assignment work for two classes . Ahaha I was thinking isn’t it usually like 18-24...it’s a class for babies (freshman) so maybe they were confused..I think they were also just not doing well cause they were genuinely upset..end of the semester we’re all a bit unstable . Yeah, I’m pretty curious to see what they make.. 
Ahah that’s exactly what my prof said - brains fried . OHh my bathing suit will be here tomorrow!!! ITS PROBABLY TOO SMALL, bUT IM TRYING. wow
i opened this file i thought I hadn't prepared to screen print but
I did 
great job past me. Oh. I ran out of floss but there’s a new pack in the drawer . Wow. Omg these would make a good zine. Me before every con: I’ll make new signs 
Signs: (still from 2016). the problem with going to bed at 1 and getting up at 8 for class is I get 4 hours of sleep 
You may say waits that’s not a math but its an hour to fall asleep, I inevitably wake up 4-5 hours in - today it was at 6 - then I just fall asleep when the trash guys come and then I’m Up. Here’s what this looks like on a graph pic.twitter.com/3gFK0FCCAv. I’m sorry. Yeah The only solution is leaving enough time to sleep again after the break sigh. Lrt quick someone give me $1500 to fly to Japan. Honestly I would buy this zine. ((Yknow not like fancy art book like photocopied)). ohh maybe not...It's called Sleep Cycle. jennie worries over nothing part 34359183058740
(narrator: it was fine). Damn I sprinted and it was just barely but I did make the train 
There are NO sponges in the studio anymore apparently so I half left ink in my screen    seriously What the fuck. I also left ink on....my hands  pic.twitter.com/DoZgGcKiok. I know it’s not swimmy season yet :( I wanna kayak but my neighbors still haven’t put out their dock!!! They have boats why did they not do the thing. Why am I dressed head to toe in gray rn it’s SPRING. I started watching the first few eps if BNHA with my normie friend but it didn’t stick but he sends me a vid today of him watching Two Heroes and I’m like !!?!? 

I asked who his faves are but he didn’t reply yet ... Also I think I may have lost a bit of the weight I gained bc I’ve been screen printing instead of eating which is probably not good but. Bathing suit. I’ll eat and sleep again starting May 1st. I’m still waiting   will update when I get the answer....I. Citra I have a related story for you. I enjoyed this anime so I was looking on a forum to see if the manga or novel had been translated into English and this person genuinely asked, “If it hasn’t been translated into English then how did they make the anime!?”. Long shadows 
Also today is not that day but I feel like one of these days I Will drop my phone from the balcony pic.twitter.com/rqHmUUjZbu. Shoutout to my migraine for starting off at an 8 and tapering down to a 3 ,,, thank you. At least they knew it was stupid pic.twitter.com/e0uT37Gp5T. update: He said Deku and Bakugou and I was gonna jokingly call him a basic bitch but beside Kirishima that's also Me so I have no rights
There's no shame in loving the protag and his rival. wait I forgot about the 1000 other characters I love
shit honestly who knows, they're all good kids. me: (designs an enamel pin for surface design with no intention of making it despite strong desire)
prof: I love it! Make four more!
me:. Everyone (myself included) adores rainbow metal pins but I cannot visualize it at all on a design/mock up. SERIOUSLY I know people who were spray painting in their rooms in winter. Idk how y’all survive I’m so sensitive to stuff like that . My charms arrived..now if only I had...a table........

(Ps I’ll send preorders very soon!!). I felt awful today but the things I was worried about actually went pretty smoothly. Giving in —- no promises but Very curious https:// twitter.com/my2k/status/11 17970671139639298   …. Rude. Hnn god I have this no.6 print that I first tried drawing in like 2015 and I just couldn’t get it right and since then once a year I reopen it, struggle to start it over, sigh, and put it away again . GRRR those douchebags making the development on this beautiful field cut down 20 trees at the edge of the forest across the street   this town sucks what the fuck kind of “conservation” is cutting down trees to make parking spots. The small bandanas came out sooo cute!!! I hope I have enough time and energy to make the big ones before the semester ends bc this size is too small for Cade (and other med-big doggies) pic.twitter.com/dfQpK8Lfqf. THANK YOU SO MUCH!! TT A TT That's so sweet
A few have some little issues but hey that's screen printing for ya . LMFAO HER FACE IN THIS.................even tho I gave her a treat she wouldn't look at me no matter what, lately she's obsessed w my mom so I had her stand behind me . My period thought “yknow what’s a good time? AB and finals”. One year I got it for almost every single convention - it would literally come weeks late just to mess w me I swear . I’m trying to will it away which has never worked in the past but I’m still gonna . aaa Thank you Rosie!!! <3. THANK YOU!!

Ps I’ve already crashed and am functioning at like 45% rn so be gentle. IM CRYING LOOK WHAT MY MOM GOT AS HER BADGE NAME!! And the staff member had my charms on their ita bag  pic.twitter.com/hsjvX4lcm9. LMFO I WAS LIKE I DONT THINK THEY RECOGNIZED ME AHAHHA. I didn’t realize I was behind you til you tripped and I was like DO U NEED HELP cause I’ve been reading your cursed baggage issues all week. RIGHT! I hope they come by. Lmfao I don’t blame u my hair is like 7000 colors rn and I’m also bad at faces!! I’ll see you sometime this weekend !! It is . SHE IS. THANK YOU!! it was so stressful but it worked out. Damn!!! I heard of this happening at another con, I’ll watch for them. Thank you!! What the fuck.  RIA!!!  Haven’t done my rounds yet but I will seee you soon!!! YEAH I LOVE HIM HES OVER HERE NOW. AFTER ALL THAT I DONT THINK I SAID HAPPY BIRTHDAY BUT HAPPY BIRTHDAY. OH I just saw a coyote. Aaaa I really didn’t do much! We were just trying to help each other through the nonsense   I had a nice time, I hope you did too!!! Damn my subconscious knew it was Bakugou’s birthday cause I put this in without thinking about it  pic.twitter.com/uQiWziegUB. LRT More good content of my mom. I KNEW U WERE ALONE AND WANTED U TO EAT FRIEND. An actual angel bought a screen printed item and gave me a KitKat  pic.twitter.com/aPPuc3unpT. My favorite thing at cons is when instead of asking for “Wild Wild Pussycats” charms, people say “Pussycat Dolls” bc it’s just that ingrained in everyone’s brains. My mom covering for a neighbor pic.twitter.com/BAdRD2fKZS. Me too dude. TWO LEFT....  #animeboston pic.twitter.com/Q73uQrGIci. EXACT SAME. OK FRIEND. Follow up - I got this at other cons and twice today: “Can I have Ash and A.J.?” .

(Also I reposted this bc I forgot the photo the first time whoops). My closet, full of shapeless unisex graphic tees. Photo of my mom, carrying seven cups, having left one upstairs,  completely done with my bullshit

“I understand that you bring a cup up every night but..” pic.twitter.com/tfTtmFcZUh. i'm so deep in it for fr*its basket english dub that i just signed up for a free trial of funim*tion I have to cancel in 14 days, you bastards. been too dead to tweet but I got a really, really nasty cold. Last time I lucked out so I forgot how awful these things can be. 
I'm also very upset because this was my last week to screen print and now I'm not sure if I can get anything else done before the studio closes. all that aside I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO EVERYONE WHO CAME BY AT ANIME BOSTON! It really is my precious home con and it's so amazing the dozens of artists, cosplayers, followers, etc. that I've been able to meet and make connections with over the past years of doing this. It was so lovely to see everyone --- there were so many friends there that I got to see some of you more than others but I'm sure our paths will cross again soon!! . I'm too dead to post a haul rn (y'all who do immediately are so strong...I think I may have a couple of pics from at the con tho..) but I'll do smth soon! As usual I have a lot to show from trading with friends both old and new and supporting other artists!! I cant think much rn so I just wrote to my profs that i am 'very gross' and will not be attending today. on top of like, haha i did one of the big projects but it's still finals so i'm? have shit to do? by the beginning of next week? help. OOF honestly there's been a gross cold going around my school for like, a month, and everyone sick on the train etc, so I think the stress and sleep deprivation leading up to the con was what opened me up to getting this :( aa thank you for the rec! i've been in bed for so long that my hips hurt so i'm trying to sit up and be a person for a little bit hence all the tweeting. ps trying to get a day-of table was stressful as heck, but it all worked out + I got to spend the weekend with @sara_capello  (who I hopefully did not get sick...DRINK SOME OJ FRIEND...) which was really lovely!!! Being able to table with a friend helps the slow times fly by too. If you don't fill out the goodsmile survey asking for a Kirishima Eijirou nendo then we can't be friends I'm sorry that's just how it works http:// special.goodsmile.info/nendoroid_surv ey/en/   …. guh don't know if I'll go into school tomorrow either..I feel pretty shit and getting up early to sit in an enclosed train with other people, on the way to a tiny enclosed room with other people sounds like a bad..also I've barely done shit on this assignment bc con/sick. Hi doctor just calling to confirm, my Ben*dryl told me to blaze it ? pic.twitter.com/HUbuLgrAYS. In all seriousness tho I’m trying to decide whether or not to take this bc my nose is running and I need sleep but if it makes me drowsy and I still can’t sleep it’ll be even worse. LMFAO Sounds good to me..I’d love to not be present in my body rn   It says 1-2 so maybe I’ll take 1. Great minds think alike . Just woke up again. Am I going to school tomorrow? Dhdnfnf ugh. Ok i did my time I would like to feel better now please thank you guhhhh. Email to professors about absence from class: I’m very gross 
Email to classmate about absence from art sale: get that bread. Gwah I was on track before this cold but if I didn’t have to email all my profs I wouldn’t know what day it was anymore tbh
I wanna see endgame tomorrow still...and screen print...also SCHOOLWORK  break, u stupid cold!!! Sudden strong desire to watch the episode of ATLA where the fire nation kids have a beach episode. This cold totally wrecked me I think I’ve been in the same pajamas since Sunday night...My very ambitious goals for today are sit outside and take a shower today. Guh this happens to me too!! It sucks cause headbands are so cute!! I’ve done the tie a ribbon like a headband thing but it’s not quite the same.. This is also the reason we can’t wear those cute knit headband things in fall RIP. I tried pic.twitter.com/dEbFQ2EhTw. Here’s a pic I took on Friday of some things I got at AB!! I was so happy @tendiadems  was there so I didn’t have to pay for shipping   @catscantdraw  @braidcut    pic.twitter.com/6xHp4lNQwz. thank you dear friend. Don't see it in their online store rn but it's from @braidcut  !!! They have one of Reigen+Serizawa+Tome too!! ahah yeah Rin was dying on the concert wall . ps your twitter name rn is Gold. Feel worse again. At the up and down stage, Popping tylonel and benadryls like there’s no tomorrow. (inhale)
(cough)
(scream). not that i have the energy for it but none of my profs told me what to do and next week everything's due so (anxiety intensifies). the only good thing about being sick is I can do stupid shit like watch the live action Kim P*ssible and not feel guilty about wasting time. update: it was pretty bad
i was ok with it - kids stuff is stupid sometimes but still enjoyable - but then it got Stupid yknow. I can only be awake for like 2 hours before I start feeling like shit again. Am I really gonna weigh in on discourse for a fandom I’m not in?...someone hold me back. Wasn’t there a like.. BL Rock band anime people were excited for? (Not yet I’m guessing). I wanna watch kimetsu no yabai but I’m worried if I do when I’m in cold induced haze later I’ll be like wait what happened . Me: maybe I’ll wake up feeling better
Me: (dehydrated as fuck)
Me: wait no. My professors know the semester ends in 5 days right
Because no ones emailed me back still 
Hello I need time to do the things please tell me the things to do. Ah yes of course ...where else would one walk their sheep. I’ll just leave this here  pic.twitter.com/SZ0quAFj7T. A comprehensive summary. Seriously I’m starting to feel good enough that I’m not in a constant haze now so if they could reply that’d be great thanksndndbd. I had the opposite problem once (bc I also don’t wear my glasses like a fool)
there was talk of a bear in the neighborhood and I was like “Ohmygod that’s the bear, a small bear — does that guy not see the bea—-“ 
narrator: it was his big fluffy dog. Ugh I was gonna try to do my last day of screenprinting on Sunday but I’m still in pretty bad shape and it’s so physically intensive and with inhaling chemicals and shit. I just want a bandana that fits my doggo. Asfsuif thank you   the worst of it is over but it’s just a really nasty cold..and just terrible timing  I’m taking it really easy tho so hopefully things improve more quickly. Feel like I should take mucinex but I’ve never taken it before and I’m Scared. Uhh the one I have is like “12 hour extended release” pill. It’s 65 out and I’m about to eat Jewish chicken noodle soup again. Hnn yeah that’s what I seem to be reading. I’m pretty prone to nausea - I sometimes vomit when coughing up phlegm - and it’s extended release so it’ll Last.. I feel like maybe not . JESS! I’m sorry you’re dealing with this too.. I think mine may be from school  yeah everyone seems to be saying nausea so I think I’ll take the 0..I’ve been using tylonel for aches but I’ll try to get the cold specific one!! Thank you and I hope you feel better soon too! . you know i'm really not feeling well when i'm deadass about to refund my Avengers tickets for tonight.. Y’all I’ve been mostly laying in bed for four days now and gosh your body gets soo sore..I just remembered I saw a test they wanted people to lay down constantly for like 3 weeks to see what would happen and you could not pay me to do that. Looks so nice and healthy !! Imagine if this was your move . Ok like I am very sick but listening to my mom on the phone playing it up to get ticket refunds is hilarious “No ones gonna wanna sit next to her” “Her friend won’t come near her” @grimmfirefly. Small haul...smhaull. ((Finger guns)). I don’t blame you, if the roles were reversed I sure as hell wouldn’t come LMFAO 
I also just Refuse to be that guy who is coughing up a lung during a tense moment. Ok I’m still feeling shit but I’m mostly lucid now but can I just say?? this cold has really Sucked?? The result of the mental stress about finals and the physical stress of AB’s nightmarish 12 hour AA days.. OH also I got into pop cult!! Cons within an hour radius make me feel so blessed. Aa no, any reminders are good! My bottle of water is in bed w me and yet I haven’t drank in like an hour   like a fool. Me: (big sigh)
Mom: I know, you’re bored....you need a good puzzle 
Me: I....what? Yeah!! I got to go once back in 2017 so I’m excited to return! there are so many starred emails in my inboxes i cannot deal with it. Since I’ve been in bed for four days and sleeping at will I’ve been using my medicated nasal spray that I usually do once a day (but think it’s ok to do twice a day) somewhat randomly and I think I overdid it but genuinely do not know. Avengers: edamame. The Twitter moment left out the g in endgame and my brain kept reading it this way   glad it made ya laugh ! I didn’t do my hw still (and still waiting on replies from profs) but I did do my course reviews which were due in 3 weeks so uh yeah. Still too lazy to make a discus(sp?) but I also don’t know where this is going and also am loving it. You ever read the tags for a fic and immediately go, “oh, the person who wrote this is 13”. Yes!! Do it!! This tweet took a hard turn :( . Mood. Hesitate to call this a pro-tip because it is so stupid, but if you have sinus pressure/stuffiness and don’t feel like Total shit then try doing 10-20 jumping jacks. 

Don’t@me there’s some science behind it. I remember doing it all the time when I got sick in high school. I keep messaging more of the studio monitors about what the last day to print is but no one feels inclined to answer me this week hnn. Ok - texted ANOTHER print monitor, emailed one professor again like hey I’ve got three days so you want me to fucking do smth for your class or not. and if I don’t get a reply by 8 or 9 tonight from my other prof I’ll email her again bc I don’t wanna work more without her feedback or I may waste time on smth she wants me to change completely...and the other class I guess I’ll just? Do my best? I have the basic requirements but I feel like I missed the personal guidance/examples day..kate help me price my zine pls
Ok I’m starting to fade again so nap time and maybe when I next wake I’ll have something in my inbox. An artist I’ve followed for a long time just announced a collab with HERSELF that’s some big dick energy right there. I don’t even like slime but I want this?? You ever purposefully draw a set of illustrations using the exact same size brush with no pen pressure then get critique saying the lineweight is heavier on one. Four more days four more days. Another critique was that my animals look too sad which is 100% the result of an abnormality in my brain caused by this guy pic.twitter.com/hoIkUoQFNR. To think all these years..he wasn’t sad..he was just chillin . Before I zoomed in I thought it said ‘AAAAA!’ (instead of ‘RRRR!’) and I was like yeah that’s pretty much my reaction . (A therapist office, in an alternative universe)
Me: here u go (hands Cuppy)
Troubled child: wow he’s so cute! but he looks..
Me: go on...
Child: Sad 
Me: OOF BAD NEWS KID YOUVE GOT PROBLE—-. lrt me at the end of the semester alternating between determination and despair. @ andythelemon_. BIGGEST PET PEEVE IS WHEN PEOPLE DON'T (LET ME SPOIL THEM) DO THIS!

Cady's hot new look#trending. twitter focusing on the highest point of contrast is the bane of my existence bc it doesn't matter how you crop it, you're fucked. I see some people putting their signatures there to make it focus but then....there's text there...YOU LOSE NO MATTER WHAT. because they love chaos. Aaaa this bag would be cute as hell for Ichigo

Good luck you two!! /SLAMS THE LIKE BUTTON SO HARD. RIP my mom - she’s not dead but she seems to be coming down with the same cold  @her immune system please wait I’m not better enough to care for us both yet 

Also shoutout to my mom bc if she didn’t tell me to eat at least 2x a day for the last week I probably wouldn’t have. Oof haven’t experienced this in a minute but my brain decided to do that manic/obsessive thing and I’m not in the mood since it’s not abt schoolwork and that’s what I need to do aaa.......and guess I’ll just fucking make a logo since this guy isn’t writing back to me .

I forgot almost every year jfc. my mom keeps reading me disturbing details about the synagogue shooting even tho i asked her to stop so that's fun. SEL..WOW THESE ARE?? SO CRISP?! idk what it is but they look REALLY GOOD . Lrt me trying to finish my last three days of school. I was feeling so good about having just enough time to do everything but then I got sick and my last bits of motivation and energy for school were annihilated. My brain already marked it DONE but in reality I have things to wrap up and I just keep picking away at the. Open file, fiddle for an hour, close (hours later) open file, fiddle for an hou—-. I ordered supplies for the thing I’m fixated on. They won’t be here til May 23rd (rolls around). I MEAN I HAVE TO DO THE WHOLE DRAWING PART but. I wish! The studio closes this week and I don’t have anywhere else or a home set up yet :(. Ok none of the FOUR!!!! studio monitors were able to tell me when it closes (three did not reply, one replied but was like “til the end of the semester” which I know for a fact is not true) so I’m really about to call security and ask if they can go read the sign on the door. I was considering looking into monitoring since I’ve been so unhappy with the way things have been run but I don’t wanna be solely responsible to make things run smoothly by myself either hnn. There is no solution . my self confidence is bad but the popcult anime con acceptance email was pretty cute pic.twitter.com/H9ziQhocB7. ok my prof hasn't replied all week, I had no examples to go off of and limited guidelines so i just
fucking made some things and 
they are what they are. security guy: it may be tuesday but you should contact the man
me: (muffled screaming bc I DID contact the man) t..hank ...you. Anext?? <3. Several days late but #faceyourart  meme!!

I will RT an endless number of illustrations of Ash and Eiji just embracing don't@me. avengers viewing heavily delayed by illness but just bought those good good middle seats for Wednesday. HAHA YIKES pic.twitter.com/88EAZtSqPP. Organizing is a lot of work but buddy that is not the solution YEESH. ps this was initially posted by someone in AANI but the post was removed. hopefully they'll change it if people speak up;;. It's a bl*zblu x unist zine (whatever the hell that is)
I don't want to direct a swarm of people over there, but I feel like people who see/in that fandom will surely make a fuss about it so hopefully they'll change their mind;;. yeah..for profit zines and taking a bigger cut for organizing is ok but not...the whole pie lmfao. THESE PHOTOS ARE SO CUTE!!! THANK YOU SO MUCH!! that outrageous zine reminded me i never divied up funds for this old project so now i'm getting lost down that rabbithole instead of doing hw. Ok!! I did the math I'll write it up and e-mail y'all in the next few days
You know who you are haha. TRADES/PURCHASES FROM AB... there’s more I just haven’t found them yet   ...I don’t know a couple of people’s usernames off the top of my head so ask if you wanna know and I’ll do my best! pic.twitter.com/obof88PM7r. Also I couldn’t tag but Halloweens by @braidcut. Gonna mute this so@me elsewhere or dm me if you have a question or smth!! https://www. youtube.com/watch?v=NGESBZ N8kH0   …. god i'm almost almost done w these drawings...
then to fold the wrinkly zines for my other class
then i can d*e 
(except I know my prof on wednesday will want edits even tho it's the final class). I was gonna say lilacs!! Maybee you could do some research and see what purple flowers they’re into. Update! The creator of this zine clarified their intention, but others *have* done shit like this in the past, so it wasn't unreasonable to assume they meant what was written - So take this instead as a general reminder that artists deserve to be paid for the work!   Thanks! (About to go out for the first time since Anime Boston)
Me: does it look like I brushed my hair today 
Mom: yeah
Me: ok good cause that’s the only standard I’m holding myself to. Spare me~~

Staples is horny for purple pass it on pic.twitter.com/yVg6lDGzvf. It’s really a hell of a cold   I hope you can rest soon  Drinking tons of water is the most important thing! I feel like there’s a solid 50/50 split of people being extremely excited or absolutely outraged when it’s revealed that a top they want is cropped. I need a Twitter moment of all these bakuboys. lrt omg..this looks wild. please cross your fingers that the screen studio is open for printing til wednesday otherwise catch me trying to rush to finish in the 2.5 hours til closing following 8 hours of classes while still sick tomorrow. i have to reclaim a screen then burn two screens instead of no reclaiming and just burning one bc i am a FOOL. I hear bird that makes see-saw noise
Please be quiet see-saw bird. Don’t we all . Omg I’m sure your replies will get flooded but I’ll toss these your way just in case  pic.twitter.com/IwmtM1l8DM. My moms sleeping pattern is so infuriating. I went to bed at midnight and she PINKY PROMISED ME SHE WAS GOING TO BED YET SHE SENT ME A TEXT AT 4:30 . Deadass still having sinus issues which switch sides of my nose on day 10 of this cold . Several people have told me I need to make a catalogue for AX And that’s one of my worst nightmares. Looks like it’s been deleted ? :(. God do I love putting one one piece of clothing and being dressed ..dresses, rompers, jumpsuits? All good shit. Me: wakes up early to fold more zones so I don’t bring the minimum number in
Me: lays in bed for 20 mins. PLOT TWIST ITS OPEN ALL FUCKING WEEK pic.twitter.com/miuK5l0a4p. Good news I don’t have to overwork myself while I’m still unwell, bad news I’ll feel guilty if I don’t take advantage of the free time so now I’m trying to think if I can fit in another project and if so what. Yeeee I got my mom a Mother’s Day present (and some other cool books) in self-publishing class heh. Lmfaoo no. I’ll show you in secret on Wednesday!! Oh shit that’s tomorrow ok tomorrow!! Tho that’s a good point I should get a card.  GO TO HER!! Guh. Now that I’m out and about living my life and not just chilling at home I’ve realized that wow I am still not feeling great. I wonder if I have a sinus infection.. Got out 3 hours early and It’s quiet and I’m not sure if people will be rushing to finish things for class tomorrow so I’m gonna work a little now even tho I’m not super healthy lmfao... Yeah it is Day 10 and I’ve been the same the last three or four days.. my body is like “this is as good as you’re getting buddy” :(. Damn two seconds too slow for the washout booth looks like my ass is here til 9. I SAW AVENGERS SPOILERS damn. (Even more softly) go to her. People used too-hot water and melted apart the glue that held together the old scoop coaters, but the new ones are wider than the open space in our screens so it goes BUMPBUMPBUMP up the sides and makes a really thick and uneven coat . I hope you find her! Jesus that’s dangerous. Yay! Screens burned and all set to print big dog bandanas tomorrow!! @ grimmfirefly  hopefully I can print them before our hang!!! THIS CAPTION. LRT I FUCKING SNORTED. !applying for M*CE !!

A balanced breakfast   Prof says she’s bringing bagels but last time she said pizza and brought vegetarian sushi so pic.twitter.com/HAu7PkBBVp. I could’ve gotten more sleep but not having to do work on the train is pretty relaxing. I’m on the train and this guy has an insane hat I’m trying to decode please help pic.twitter.com/4AcQT12CtV. OH!! Cool! Wow thank you so much, curiosity sated!! hehe No worries! Thank you!! <3. update: she brought 1 day old raspberry pastry and a fruit salad. The color came out a bit more red than orange   curse screen printing ink for drying darker.

TO BE FAIR I WAS VERY DISTRACTED BC SOMEONE ELSE WAS CRYING VERY LOUDLY.  have an amazing time!!! Toasty pic.twitter.com/aTLuLotc0R. /pats you . I resigned myself to blonde then my hairdresser was like “do you wanna do lavender? Let’s do lavender” and showed me the perfect color her friend just did  but she has to ask which color it was and see if they have it right now SO IDK WHATS ABOUT TO HAPPEN. Omg if only I were that bold. I want it sooo badly but I feel like her friend won’t reply or she won’t have it or it won’t take — IVE WANTED PASTEL PURPLE FOR LIKE TEN YEARS!! My darker purple was really cool but more like punk leaning? I’m soft and a slut for pastels. LMFAOO IT MAY BE TOO YELLOW TO DO IT STOP PLAYING W MY FEELINGS JILL. Aaaa Jill does such a good job!! The mid/top is like just not light enough to light purple on the whole thing so I’m gonna come back in a few weeks or so and DO IT!! The problem is the blonde always looks sooo nice that I wanna keep it . Before and after!   Killing the negativity from the semester with b l e a c h pic.twitter.com/RQhkLTE8WU. Thank you!! It came out really well . So precious!! Made me smile :). didn’t realize how exhausted i am..laid down at 5:30 and just got up for dinner   ok...drawing for zine merch, final critique, then after Monday I can R E S T FOR A  MONTH. mom, a whole day after seeing endgame: now that i'm awake I'm thinking about all the avengers things ..should we watch the whole series of films over?
me: ................... FINALLY READY TO POST THESE! Here are some maid café themed enamel pins I made for my self-directed Adv. Surface Design project! 

It would cost approximately 1 bajillion dollars to produce these so right now they're just for show!  pic.twitter.com/RPn6m2BGgf. Gonna try to get most orders out tomorrow. Lrt me when kiri is included in a new merch line (also the cutest shit I’ve ever seen). I have so many things I want to do this summer!! I’m still not quite done and have to rest too tho  

Also I realized I completed six courses this school year!! I know a lot of people do that (or more) in just one semester but for me it’s a real accomplishment.. Aa thank you!!  It IS a lot!! Three per semester seems to be my limit. People who are able to do more are so strong!! I hope you have a nice summer too!..I say but it's 55 degrees out and cloudy right now haha. Hnn yeah three per semester is like 'Jennie of the verge of a breakdown but still doing ok for the moment' so people who are able to take a full courseload (4+) are so impressive to me * A* ..I also took three studio classes this semester - A MISTAKE..I assume labs are similar? Endgame spoiler?
But not really
.
.
mom: last night I looked up..the sound at the end of the movie..and it's ---
mom: (starts crying)
me: ohmygod. "they're making more movies - did you know that?" 
MOM PleASE...... Nah, the sound after the credits when they show the logo.(I don't think it's confirmed to be anything but the fan speculation). I thought all my printed and painted work from this semester was in my room turns out no it’s not and I can’t find it   ...at least I checked now so I have a few days. AAa today's fruits basket was so good! It felt like the first real example of them not just repeating the original anime. I'm excited for next week when her friends visit!! ((placeholder face)) pic.twitter.com/56qE4sN0Ci. Lrt what the fuck. MERUUUUU!!!! THANK YOU SO MUCH HOLY SHIT   You made her look so like..Gorgeous?! GLAMOROUS?! I ADORE IT   These all look great tbh, I hope this exercise helped w art block!! OH also is it ok if I put it on the section of my site with my OC references? (with credit of course). LRT MERU DREW MY OC..WHOSE NAME IS MERU.........WHAT A DAY TO BE ALIVE . Surprise! I got to make a bonus sticker for Resonance: A Tsurune Zine   
This will be an 8 cm kiss cut sticker added to *all* orders!!

There's still time to pre-order a copy!
Head over to  http:// sibzine.storenvy.com    to get one for yourself~  pic.twitter.com/X72E6x6pyI. Big thanks to @andythelemon_  for having me!! I was too busy with school to finish this while the anime was airing, so I was really happy to have an excuse to draw these soft boys (and pup!!) . Are you asking what part are they at? (Just wanna make sure so I don’t accidentally spoil you). ASDFHFKL ILY TOO ANDY  I’m glad you’re happy with the result and thank you again!! So excited to get my copy! The previews look AMAZING. Mmm I mean not really? It’s still very much just the start or everything. Floof. Aaaa so sweet!! I think it ends 5/5!! but just in case @andythelemon_. Ah yeah I just donated a print I have by her cause I was like “....” when I looked at it . Shipping is a nightmare! I know some big artists use companies to ship their wares for them, maybe something to think of if you do another huge project   meanwhile, GOOD LUCK FRIEND. Uh in this parking garage there’s two people sitting on the back of a truck playing guitar and flute. In a parking garage. At midnight. Hippo Campus has some rad merch!! pic.twitter.com/BqIsew9E8w. Dark.. Every time school gets out for a break I absolutely fucking Crash. Like it’s 3 and I’m in bed still I’m just exhausted from months of stress?? Yesterday I laid down cause my head hurt a bit w no intention of sleeping+just passed the hell out and slept deeply and it’s ridiculous. I made a list of four important things I keep forgetting to do and remember as soon as I crawl in bed every night and today i'm gonna FUCKING DO THEM. my credit score is better than my moms lmfao haven't fucked up ..yet. I DID THEM AND ONE MORE. THERES ALWAYS MORE TO DO BUT THANK YOU. hnn I'm trying to figure out this whole 'screen printing at home' thing and it seems like theres's a brand of chemicals that's green but..the ink is a problem when it comes to septic tanks. Hm this new ottoman isn’t as comfortable pic.twitter.com/DVCG4VNiwi. Also yes there is laundry everywhere we’re working on it. Sound on pic.twitter.com/vj9nDxHJbk. Lmfaoo your dog looks just as enthused as mine. can't believe i'm gonna vague tweet right now but?? if you can't afford to take a risk don't make?? expensive merch?????? We all make mistakes and sometimes shit just doesn't sell, but if you can't afford it or are borrowing money then do pre-orders and make sure you can at least survive or pay it back before jumping off the deep end. RIGHT like sometimes people are like PLEASE I WANT THE THING and then you go ok I made it and *crickets* 
It just happens and you have to be ok if things don't pan out!! *old man voice* back in MY DAY we made charms out of shrink plastic---
lmfao no but really you're right people are just like ENAMEL PINS!!! PLUSH!!! etc. even though they're SO expensive to produce when there are lower-risk items that people still love to buy. feeling nervous about critique w the big wigs tomorrow but I anxiously laid stuff out and..I did good work this year? like idk this looks solid to me? I'm still scared tho...rsighrdhd. THANK YOU MISTY I AM VERY SCARED.  I’ll reread this tweet in the morning when I’m holding off a panic attack on the train . BNHA fandom is screaming at each other again today as usual (puts in earplugs). Let me know if you curiosity takes over . Some kiribaku shippers made a petition to make kiribaku canon so antis are complaining about kiribaku and more mature kiribaku shippers are like hey don’t lump us all in with them and you’ve got problems too and blah blah blah. I’d sign THAT petition. Sleep Cycle is really amazing idk how it knows I’ve woken up but I’ll wake up and without moving at all think “I wonder how much time is left” and it immediately is like OH BITCH YOURE UP (alarm goes off). There’s approximately 1 billion people waiting for this train at this insane hour how do people Early
My usual morning train gets to boston just after 9 so it was quiet hnn. OHHH yes that’d be wonderful!! (Thousands of seats with three spaces)
Large man; sits in two seater w me and my giant bag of stuff for crit
Me: ok. Me@literally everyone. Idk why every single person on earth feels the need to chime on every thing it’s tiring (not trying to shit on any of my mutuals who tweeted smth I’m just making a general statement). This train skips 40 mins of stops bc there’s literally no room for more people wtf. I can see how people are Done after just like general months and months of discourse but if one little thing that SOME people did makes you so disdainful then like...chill?! Like I love my boys I’m not gonna stop making content cause some dumbasses did some random thing that doesn’t have anything to do w me. I see now that this was a strategic move in order to avoid having people on both sides of him and I’m sorry LMFAO. I should use this as training for Japan. LMFOA THIS IS A FUCKING JOKE this lady keeps saying we need to get started but there were NO thumb tacks to put up work and like 4 people used mine bc I brought some bc I know this place is a hellscape. Ahah no no I brought a ton and told them to use them. Even with all of  mine two people had to lay stuff on tables. Alright I was insanely anxious about today. Here’s a summary:
* I got four hours of sleep, rode on a packed train, and had an intense stomach ache
* I get there at the end of set up time and there’s only two kids in the room. There are no tacks left already, I brought a huge box. bc I know this school can’t even do small shit right and there still weren’t enough for everyone and people had to use tables
* The professor insisted we hurry up and get started even tho there weren’t tacks to hang up our work
* It was 2 random illus. professors, no dept head. *We got 8 minutes each instead of 12 + since few showed we were done at 9 instead of 12..1 hr vs 4
* Profs seem p impressed w my work and main critique was work on type which I know, and when I asked for class recs she said let’s talk after then ran off as soon as we finished. The rest were all freshies+after the profs left they talked abt how they misunderstood advice they were given so I tried to clarify (ie they didn’t say no detail, they said guide the eye) One liked my stickers so I gave em to her+she asked to pick a colorway for her character . Anyway I feel robbed of actually having the illustration head see my work after three years at this cursed establishment and it was mostly a waste of time since the only negative feedback I received was smth I already knew but at least I get to go home early. Lrt if you haven’t watched NO.6 what are you doin  go watch it Now. If you’re looking for an uppy Spring-y song then Simple Season by Hippo Campus is It. Ohmygod that’s like..beyond useless if you didn’t know what to take with a grain of salt it could’ve really mislead you!!
Yeah idk why I’m surprised anymore. Um Spider-Man comes out when I’m in LA what am I supposed to do. Dhjdudhd I can’t imagine T at that time!! That sounds hellish. I take the commuter rail but I’ve never seen it so packed that every. single. seat. was taken and some people had to stand . Got up from my nap to go outside w her before sunset but cady’s like bitch I’m tired too pic.twitter.com/YXjdYdpRby. My mom doesn’t feel good so she’s laying down and I’m like running around the house cleaning and she’s like jenn you seem wired LMFAO I’m just trying to harness the like positive energy of being done w school before the like “oh no I have to motivate myself for the next 3 months”. She is adorable. wanted to get one of my profs a present bc I had her the whole year and for “”independent study”” advanced surface but she’s...picky? Opinionated? she knows what she likes when she sees it   If any1 knows any1 making cool original surface design/pattern stuff link my way pls. Things have just fallen into chaos here since my mom and I got simultaneously sick post AB all my con stuff is still in the dining room, I just picked up w sweatshirt from a massive pile and out fell a single sock and a pad like what is happening. everyone who remembers me taking fashion illustration 7000 (2) years ago: oh right. hello it is fashion day #MetGala2019  
here's a fashion-y doodle????????
it started off as Celebrity I Do Not Know (bc I do not know Celebrities) but I was too married to the reference and it was looking Bad so i threw the ref away and just did whatever pic.twitter.com/YKhmXVebLY. SERIOUSLY when I see a man who really takes care of his looks I go   - and that happens about three times a year . a neighbor just emailed us like hey my kinda wanna get at the lake wanna sell us a strip of land for $10k?!? ...THE PEOPLE BEFORE US SOLD A THICK STRIP TO OTHER NEIGHBORS  WHat is happening . Who just has thousands of dollars so their kids can walk down a hill to go swimming?! Nah - the other neighbors did the exact same thing - so now they own a strip of what used to be property for this house.. They’re like “we’ll put in a dock and you can use it too” but those other neighbors already let us use theirs so. It’s just that otherwise they can’t get to the lake without technically trespassing. I just went to look at the water and like the other neighbors already park their boat technically on our property so then if these people put another dock in right next to that it’s just gonna creep over and ruin the view and like it’s so superfluous? There’s already a dock there. The other neighbor should just like sell memberships to his dock   why put in a dock right next to..a dock...............  it’s stupid.  Thank you so much! I don’t do portraits or doodle digitally often so it was a fun experiment! Me: wow!! It’s finally warm outside!! Sunny too!!
Me, 10 minutes later: i’M MELtiNG. Also yesterday we were driving a good speed on a main road and a bee NYOOOMS in the open window and now there’s one who I saw trying to get in my brothers room and then I see one trying to get in the bathroom and like WHAT DID WE DO TO YOU. LRT Retweeting because Mermay????? I should draw some mermaids. I WAS  ABOUT TO POST THAT IM DOING A LIL PROJECT RELATED TO THIS AND THEN I HAD A (VERY OBVIOUS) GENIUS IDEA and now i'm extra excite
I have a feeling it'll be one of those things that I work hard on and then no one on the internet cares but. I'm doing it so. adsgdrtrhyf THANK YOU SO MUCH TT A TT   ITS SORTA LONG ILL DM U.  It'll be a little while before everything's ready but hopefully it's before I peace out for a bit in June;;. AX initial assignments are out~ D58...Near the back...
HAHA WOW THIS IS SCARY ITS GETTING CLOSE HUH. i wanna puke LMFEAORGSNFGHjj. THANK YOU CHRIS FOR YOUR KNOWLEDGE!! YOU ARE WISE!!   It seems like not the best place but not the worst so I'm glad;; THIS SCALe..IS UNLIKE ANYTHING I'VE SEEN BEFORE. me: wow!! free from school!! draw whatever I want!!
AX: sup
me: shit I should make merch immediately. here's a money idea for ya
GEODE DEODE(rant) TM
invest in me. I SPENT A SOLID HOUR DECIDING WHAT TO GET FOR MY PROF AND I FINALLY MAKE A DECISION AND THIS ARTIST?? DOESN'T SHIP TO THE US? my privilege is showing i know but like damn who doesn't ship to the US we are...big. hnnn I sent an email laying it on thick so we'll see (it's an artist not a corporation)...pls it took me so long to decide. i am trying to make my mom understand that she has wasted at least 3 hours of her day today trying to help my douchebag uncle while he treats her like shit and yells at her on the phone, as he has for the last. 50 years. like oh you're in debt? well we received the same amount of $ and are doing fine so maybe if you hadn't paid for 10 ppl to Disney to impress em, bought houses for your kids, thousands of $ of jewelry for your wife who wont let you in the house YOU pay rent for u wouldnt. be  here. you don't get to help my family get 20 thousand dollars in debt and live in poverty for a decade then expect her to loan you that much money bc you threw yours away 
ANYWAY SORRY IM FEELING REALLY EMOTIONALLY VOLATILE TODAY. Hnn thanks friend   just too many years of this shit yknow. THIS IS SO COOL I LITERALLY RECOILED IN SHOCK UPON SEEING IT. LRTs I was not part of this but I’ve heard about this shitshow on and off. Use your discretion kids and if smth seems off - it probably is . Ok In grade school I won this contest to ?? Design a fish they auctioned off? I think the real one was plaster or smth. Who knows. Can I put this on my CV? 

Anyway my grandma threw it in the trash which is why it’s all crinkled. pic.twitter.com/qgOIvPFcYC. I TOOK THIS TO TEASE MY MOM (who drew it when I was a babe) BUT HONESTLY IT DOES KIND OF LOOK LIKE ME pic.twitter.com/QFcaB61gsg. OR JUST. Filming ANYONE like that. Not only is this visually stunning, but the concept is amazing!! I’m obsessed with @/zihee_tattooist pic.twitter.com/5tScY0tHzk. WHOOPS TWO PEOPLE SAID THEM ALREADY but i included pics so I’ll leave it . Lrt the video in that thread is Absolutely insane. for sort-of-secret project
what *SCENT* (not flavor) do y'all prefer. mind you I sometimes do whatever I want after polling but there are actually some other factors at play, but I do want to know if there is a HEAVY preference. It’s clear I don’t know how to tie a bandana since Cady isn’t into them but — look at this beautiful Model pic.twitter.com/ycxMvzbuXx. She says thank you . I just saw a guy steal the basketball from his toddler who fell on the ground and remembered this tweet. Overall great job by my neighbors - impeccable spray painting skill and A+ littering pic.twitter.com/2uCYR3R8ew. (reading a phone number)
me: -966..6
me: that's one hell of a number
me: HAH - HELL of a number. "Fun....Bundle......Fundle..."
please stop me from naming this project. Oh a DJ just said on the air that BTS had the most annoying fan base and honey, prepare to be Tweeted At. Cute guy: thank you so much!
Me: thank you, you too!!
Me, internally: Jennie you fool. I assumed he’d tell me to have a good night. At least he didn’t say “Enjoy the food!” . squirrel and rabbit shaped chicken fingers.. pic.twitter.com/rhKLYYK2Dj. tfw "Lakers" is trending you thought it said "Latkes". sfdgsdgh friend wants me to go horseback riding..last time I did that was a horse named FERRARI . You can imagine why that was his name, and I was very scared. this is the biggest plot twist. straight men: we're manspreading, but...we're still not taking up enough room!! QUICK, FELLOW HETEROS -- SPREAD OUT!! hnn trying to craft an email back to the neighbors like hey we dont want to sell land really and also if you put ANOTHER dock and ANOTHER boat there it would go like halfway into our view but also not sound like a dick about it. I OFFERED ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS THOUGH. like..there is a dock there. with one boat on it. there is room for more boats. ask him if u can rent space on his dock for your boat. rob gets some cash, this guy gets a place for his boat, we get to keep our shit - EVERYONES PROBLEMS SOLVED. his email was like 'my kids are desperate to get access to the lake!' like bro your kids are toddlers  u def just wanna go out on a boat - NOT That i blame him but he's def using the adorable children card. Thank you so much for voting, I really appreciate it!! as expected, it was pretty close!! I may try both and see what happens. I did the same thing friend pic.twitter.com/4Re45kSu4R. A right of passage . Depending on what it is and the condition - donate to charity, donate to cons (like stuff prizes), textile recycling, or super sale! I tried a discount print box at a con recently and actually sold quite a few! I’m eating up everyone’s junior and senior illustration thesises yum. I prefer the proportions and larger size of 5x7. Have had so many people say they love a print but they don’t have room for a poster size so it’s def worthwhile! people are whack as hell and I’m sorry this is happening on your post!! The whole thing is so sunny and fun and doesn’t deserve this negativity!! . YES IT IS GOOD. i just wish us*s tracking was not broken literally every night
it doesn't even say 'maintenance' it's just like WHOOPS SORRY WE'RE USELESS every night. ITS BACK NOW but seriously. yay!! More project supplies here tomorrow!! ... Except the thing I need to have in hand before I order stickers shipped like a week late so it's gonna be a bit hnn. OH GOOD. SO WE WENT TO CHANGE THE FILTER ON THE FRIDGE WATER AND TURNS OUT THE GUY NEVER PUT IT IN SO. THAT'S FUN. @ nicoima. I just bought sneakers online so we'll see how that goes. My current pair are a few years old now.. they have an ever-growing hole in the toe on one (and the other one is starting to stretch thin in that part too), and the soles are so smooth that i slip on ANY amount of water. dude what the hell these shoes were $60, on sale for $45, and with a coupon $31..and free shipping and returns...thank you universe?? if anyone needs "womens" sneakers they're 30% on p*ma w code MUM til Sunday and honestly that's a solid chunk off a pair of shoes. oof. only one some i guess. ie not the ones i was ogling months ago lmfaoo. Good job!! Same..They’re a pain to sleeve tho  . Ever since I got OUT of school I’ve been having nightmares/stress dreams ever night..brain wtf are you Doing. Adore this!! It would make a cool bandana/scarf . Honestly. Aaaa I feel like I’ve seen it before but I can’t remember!! May have been on tictail but that’s gone now  will RT. Having store credits is fun bc you can shop guilt-free even tho you technically did pay for it before. youtuber: LEARN HOW TO MAKE (redacted)!! BEST RECIPE!!!
youtuber: "I didn't really use measurements, I just eyeballed it". EVERY DAMN TIME. How can you say this video is teaching you how to make something or has a recipe when theres' NO MEASUREMENTS /flails. (( not really spoilers but general comments on current BNHA manga arc: ))

gaahh I sure do miss my kids but this arc is really interesting too!! I love all these villain backstory snippets and can only hope that Dabi's is next!! I'm not really a big Dabi person but let's face it, we all want some things confirmed. can you believe i have no pokémon or pikachu themed clothing anymore to wear to this film
The closest I have is a REALLY bright yellow dress my friend gave me? so I'll? do that probably? Should I bring him yes or yes pic.twitter.com/jHFfRJQ6db. i wonder if he still works...he has a battery pack in his butt. We always check Cady for ticks and wipe her down too but we found one on the couch today and one yesterday and my mom doesn't want me to cuddle with her :( but we love each other. "huh..I don't remember *that* pokémon" - movie theater employee, internally, probably. Boy pic.twitter.com/K4LzQNiPci. pic.twitter.com/lPM1EBRCpG.  that’s so cool!! Congratulations! . Ahh Crane Estate is my favorite!! Glad you enjoyed it on such a nice day !! Concerns I have about dying my hair pastel purple in order of importance: 1. all the mustard colored clothes I now have 
2. Maintaining it. I fucked up - I wrote her in for the two year term since someone retired instead of the regular five year term - but she won! By 13 votes, but she won. VOTE IN LOCAL ELECTIONS, KIDS ..and also read carefully pic.twitter.com/UaDijUWVAj. I still can’t believe they allow developers on the planning board how the FUCK is that not a conflict of interest. I try to drink so much water and am perpetually dehydrated yet I know so many people who just do not drink water and seem to function fine and am I the only human who needs water or. YEAH HOW THE HELL DO THEY DO THAt?! I just told my friend to drink water and he was like “oh I had that big soda tho” and it’s like YEAH OK THAT WASNT?? WATER?? Seriously how do they do it. Tell me your secret!!  I drink some soda but like. All my friends can just down a whole bottle like it’s nothing ?? I’ve been better about having soda AND water w a meal so that I don’t just drink soda bc it’s there even tho I’m thirsty for water yknow? W h a t no one warned me of this. PFFF pointing and laughing isn’t nice!!   Well, WELCOME TO HELL . If it helps I heard that stirring in a small amount of salt (so little you can’t taste it) helps your body absorb water or smth idk I’m not a scientist u can google it lmfaoo. I’ve used Primark before but my friend and I have had good luck with items from  https://www. clothingshoponline.com    ! Neither of us got tracking numbers but the packages arrived in like two days and were good quality! Haven’t tried crop tops from them yet tho. I use eco friendly bubble mailers now and honestly I’m just Still using bubble wrap and paper from when we moved a year and a half ago. You could try asking local stores if they’d let you take their packing supplies instead of throwing them out? for cardboard for prints/zines. pic.twitter.com/Pcxz65XLYN. Just looked it up - ‘98. 2 hours after endgame: asleep 
2 hours after detective pikachu: (still critically analyzing every detail and plot point). The point here is not that we’re picking it apart just that we’re still talking about it. Ohh!! That’s so different from here! We’re wasteful af so if you’re moving and looking for boxes it’s fairly common to ask at like supermarkets and stuff! Aah well I hope you find some good solutions soon . @ egoisticartist. “Huh...I’ve never seen one like this before.” - Every worker about literally any given thing in our house. It took four plumbers to figure out what water pump we had. The house is a mess and I decided today would be a good cleaning day but I’m suddenly feeling motivated to do art related things send help. Me: (spills a bunch of dog food on the floor)
Cady: ...
Me: ...
Cady: ......
Me: so are u gonna clean this up or. pic.twitter.com/aQwRkhGRcl. yay!! one of my summer goals was uploading all my patterns to spoonflower! I'm done with existing ones, just considering if I can make a few more out of existing artwork before ordering the mandatory sampler so I can sell in their marketplace!! Ok my body is still a bit broken from horseback riding (I am weak) but I need a break from screens and to move around so. Smoll cleaning break. Mom talking abt my crazy aunt: she’s a little..yknow she’s got her own..
Me: ..the word you’re looking for is /mishegoss/. A whole house and then some to clean yet I clear a pile off of a chair and I’m like wow I nailed that time to rest. Every time I clean my room I never make it to this really overwhelming pile that makes it hard to get to my biggest window and I decided to go through it a bit and. This is just. A giant box. Of crumpled paper. pic.twitter.com/DKIqZ1SdWW. Rules to live by:
* never start a pile, never Have a pile
* never start in on a pile, never Not Have a pile. My bro said this tree was gonna fall soon and he was Correct and it Scared the Shit Out of Me since I was right next to the window inside pic.twitter.com/XxR5E48505. Idk who hurt them but these pants used to be Me sized when I was smaller than I am now pic.twitter.com/SZuyRXxx0J. Oof imo strike when the iron is hot (draw while you’re feeling it esp if inspiration has been elusive lately). My eyes shriveled up and died. Unfollowed reported blocked ://////. Broke: These pants got stretched out in some bizarre laundry accident
Woke: Everything in the world except these pants shrunk. ((Throws a box of crackers@u)). Thank you for your support in this troubling time. GOOD !! . “Don’t forget to drink water” - my mom as she hands me THIS pic.twitter.com/lYWkLSc5EJ. Process: Chaotic Neutral pic.twitter.com/n8i8I24rmv. My mom and I imitating Yuki’s voice actor 
“Miss Honda”
“No, he whispers it — Miss Honda”
“Miss Honda, you have nice cars”
“Wha—-Ohmygod.”. I CAN DRAW IT JUST TAKES ME A MINUTE OK. Wow I bought a book of poetry from my classmate and I was happy to support her and I don’t know shit about poetry but.. I THINK ITS.. REALLY GOOD!! aaa some people have such a way with words!! you can find her art and poetry at  http:// jhernandez.work    if you’re curious!! it's 2 but i'm worried if i stop drawing this comic in the middle i'll draw totally differnet next time i work on it. I’d like you all to know that there was a second similarly sized box that was mostly bubble wrap and tissue paper. Didn’t finish the pile but made a good dent!! Yesss glad you’re back on board!!

Aaa I’m curious how you’ll feel about the original if you haven’t seen it in a while and are watching the new one   def give it a go. Yesterday I was so motivated and today I am
Not. Yesterday I uploaded a ton of stuff to spoonflower, walked cady, cleaned the house for a few hours, helped move a downed tree, and made good progress on a drawing

I am currently still in bed like a fool. Thank you so much for the support! My @bananafishzine  came today!! Thank you so much to the organizers! Despite the hiccups during production, all the merch came out so well! The book I’m particular is really high quality   Misprinted zines are still available for purchase if you missed out! pic.twitter.com/SOz5QnPBei. Also holy hell — the covers? Gorgeous. The interior graphic design? Stunning. my mom desperately wants cady to be one of those dogs that has a like stuffed animal companion she cares about so she put her elephant on the couch where she sleeps a few days ago and like..it's still here but it's more like she hasn't moved it rather than she has embraced it. My mom tried a new approach with this black lab plush I have pic.twitter.com/HEZNhHHjVt.  good stuff! Worth the wait~. I lucked out . https://www. youtube.com/watch?v=F5yy1b nqgw   … 
Will you tell the truth so I don't have to lie? oof cleaning is a nightmare my mom just found our giant compilation of menus from when we lived an hour away and before the internet was easily accessible on your phone. ok i'm pooping out one final pattern then placing my sample order for spoonflower >:). ORDERED
 I have a fucking headache but it's done. I never read loveless but I’m excited to see the answer to this. Lrt first part is me every time I wake up ((CHUGS ENTIRE BOTTLE OF WATER)). LRT IBFUCKING LOVE HIMDBFJX

Ps I went to bed early cause I didn’t feel good so now it’s <5 and here I am. This San-x wasabi plush keychain was hanging on our kitchen cabinet for a long time but I broke the chain a few days ago and my mom and I just keep moving him around the kitchen like elf on the shelf and I just deadass choked while drinking water bc he’s riding a ceramic chicken. As seen in the photo of my mug from the other day. Reminding me of Lg Chocolates... pic.twitter.com/XOCggoBgiB. Fuckkk my period started during AB last month but then went “u seem busy I’ll give u a break”. in xchange I’ve been having pains on:off all month long (usually I only have one or two pangs) and now it’s early and hurts like a bitch worse than in a long time all the way to my feet. Can’t even imagine some people not having access to birth control when your body just naturally does stupid shit like this or worse. Ow I found some pain is relieved in my andomen by twisting my back but then uh that hurts your back . Only valid if named after anime character, bonus points for a Hamtaro hamham. This tweet went in a different direction than anticipated. Lrt I forget where I was but I read about this in a museum.. If it helps I’ve been really enjoying them and it’s a good constant reminder that my dumb ass hasn’t watched ant man and the wasp yet. Ohh tomorrow is an exciting mail day (unless u*ps or f*dex change their minds). @ grimmfirefly. mom: i didn't mean to leave for so long, I thought you didn't feel good....honey you look like you don't feel good 
me: WOW thanks
mom: I just mean you look tired
me: (starts tearing up) I feel tired
anyway periods amirite folks haha. Thank you friend but it’s just fatigue I did almost nothing today . THIS BUMS ME THE HELL OUT that people are recklessly saying that.. it’s literally just...not at all the same?? So much of your love and own personal style went into this too, as someone who’s been following you for a while!! People are whack try not to let them get ya down!! Wait for it pic.twitter.com/J7MHAgC7vX. mom: did the silverware not get clean?
me: no I emptied it then took only the silverware from the sink bc I know you hate how I load the dishwasher. that's the only thing you won't "correct"
((clinking sounds))
me: MOM ARE YOU REDOING THE SILVERWARE
mom: I'm not redoing ALL the--. literally there is a bin in the dishwasher where you just put the silverware in so i?? PUT IT IN THERE?? AND YET???? sometimes you just have a bad print day!! I hope your next session goes better! :). ! yay! bakusquad comic should be done in a day or two!! just gotta polish the first and last panels
LMFAOO THREE PAGES AND IT TOOK ME APPROX 4000 HOURS i'll never be a comic artist y'all .. you'll be like 'wait this didn't take you one single afternoon?' LMFAOO. Ahh well I could’ve just sketched it or done sloppy line art but I’m out here doing full color lineless like a fool   maybe I’ll choose differently next time
This did make me feel better tho thank you!! . YEAH LIKE Velinxi painting their wholeass comic   so strong. Photo of him on the chicken (ignore the mess)...I just moved him to inside a cabinet, excited to see what happens  pic.twitter.com/5cCXti6k9N. What the fuck is this u*ps there’s not even a time stamp and it ends w a comma pic.twitter.com/EbBAFK2k2y. I fully support this secular wasabi. I’m sooo bummed out y’all. I need these in order to move forward with this project and they have been delayed before and after being shipped  I can’t believe it doesn’t even say where it IS or when it WILL arrive . It’s just like hey u May notice it’s not at your house today like we said it would be like yeah no shit so where is it now and when will it be here ((rolls around)) I finally reached the limits of my patience. R u daijouokay. Oof don’t really participate in the fandom anymore so I wouldn’t kno abt drama but omg episodes airing when the hell ever all over the world is the most frustrating thing! I understand a lot of work goes into it - just don’t say a date if you can’t meet it nearly EVERY TIME pls. Hnn im so fatigued I had like 7 hours of sleep yet here I am laying down again
I usually take pain meds once sometimes twice but so far I’ve taken them three times this month’s sucks. I had a dream I was in middle or high school and an old friends cool friend was interested in me and asked if he could knock on my door sometime during summer break once I returned from whatever away con but he never came :(. I think it’s cause I watched Oni-Chan episode of miraculous last night and I was like BOYS R SO DUMB remembering all the crush drama from middle school days . Aaah I slept a lot but it’s really beautiful outside..it looks like my neighbor finished putting the dock in...I’m so antsy aaa. I’m crying they had the audacity to send me an update message but it was literally just the same text, updated to say today instead of yesterday, with still no mention of its current whereabouts or expected delivery day pic.twitter.com/bF74dnsgVc. I’d describe my sketching style as “making a lot of lines and hoping one of them is right”. Aaaa you’ve got such a solid collection going!! I can’t wait to see it all assembled!! More  pic.twitter.com/MoihzW9QZR. Big same. There was free figure drawing every Thursday this semester but it wasn’t one of my class days and I commute   it’s so hard to find / find free / affordable sessions. ahaha sometimes when people ask to buy two of one I’m like OH they’re double sided and it’s 50/50 whether they go “OHMYGOD I DIDNT REALIZE THANK YOU” or “yeah I know but my ita bag——“ . Maybe too late but  pic.twitter.com/WC2nkJzUUm. Yess omg I took a class called Fashion & Body Adornment where we oddly did mostly figure drawing and I loved it!! I think most of my classmates were put off tho like “this isn’t what I signed up for”. Regardless of enjoying it or not tho the basics are the basics! I ended up watching Barry and I got more of the Dark in Dark Comedy than I bargained for ouch. EJDBDJSNDJ I finished season one...there were so many times he could have...left I’m .. Notes: 
> Sea creatures are not scientifically accurate but that isn’t what this comic is about 
> They aren’t buff oops
> I AM GENUINELY SORRY I DIDN’T INCLUDE SERO I didn’t know what animal to make him and also ....didn’t wanna draw another panel..it fits so neatly this way  pic.twitter.com/Nm5fJloqkZ. Me: I want something satisfying
Mom: wanna make a pizza?
Me: what? No I don’t wanna make a pizza - it’s one in the morning!!
Mom: ...Let me just check how long—
Me: N O !!! Valid but
(Gestures to the TED talk I just watched about how your brain and body get wrecked when u don’t sleep enough). I wish you all the sleep and pizza you desire .  THIS IS SUCH A SWEET COMMENT THANK U ABBY aaaa
Doing it this way was time consuming but I’m glad we’re both happy with the result!! What’s a beach comic without fun colors?! . Hnn yeah I think maybe bc it’s skews younger (like how BNHA eventually gained more younger fans too) and kids don’t know how to act — not that some adults do either LMFAO aaa yes cause I’ll get excited and it’ll be cancelled or I’ll find out I missed two episodes randomly?! AA thank you!! Every time I draw Mina I’m like “??? Is this?? Her??” So I’m glad you and others mentioned specifically how she looks cute   also yes omg I need to wallpaper my room w that kiri face . Are u sure this isn’t a myth. HAPPY BELATED BDAY also I’m upset bc I was happy that I could finally stop thinking of Taylor Swift’s 22 when I answer my age in a couple weeks and now you hit me with This Blink-182 bombshell. UPDATE ITS OUT FOR DELIVERY idk if it needs a signature but I’m worried bc even though they’re technically supposed to come to my house sometimes they just put a slip in my box like sorry I wasn’t hanging out next to my mailbox .25 miles down the street waiting to sign for it. Good luck this weekend!! Sometimes I forget the nice little gay bubble I’ve made for myself on Twitter then I look at a public comments section and go “oh no”. Like damn I wanted to see people’s thoughts on Taron Egerton as Elton John not some dumbass asking “where the movies about straight legends are” (the answer is?? everywhere?!?!) which quickly devolved into much worse homophobic bullshit. Lrt I haven’t done this but it’s probably good advice the ACEN concrete box artist alley is depressing as fuck. MY PQCKAGE CAME AND RHEYRE PERFECT IM SO EXCITED!! A few more steps before I can share with y’all aaaaaa it’s cute af. if you ever think cantaloupe is bad you didn't let it sit long enough
we cut open this 'loupe and it was objectively Bad, then let it sit a day out of the fridge, then a couple in the fridge and shit it's so good now. !!! aa this occurred to me too late!! * U* It's a good idea though, thank you!! <3. RIP well I prefer that song so it'll be ok!! LMFAO
THANK YOU!! UNFORTUNATELY NO! I've been going part time so I'm..like halfway through sophomore year technically (shudder) I've been trying to take more classes lately so I'm pushing my limits!!I'm glad it's over for a few months;. ((The way you worded this tho -- did you graduate!?!? IF SO CONGRATULATIONS!!!). CANTALOUPE IS TOO LONG A WORD THERES SO MANY SYLLABLES. it's gonna catch on just watch.  I don’t know if I commented on it but I was so happy when I saw y’all become friends!! THIS HAPPENED TO ME SOME MONTHS AGO. ohh the site I use for my store added an abandoned cart thing that's included
thoughts? /sobbing yes!! someone else pointed this out to me, but it's cursed to be that way forever on twitter+insta   Thank you though!! I've fixed it for the future  
and thank you!! I'm glad the whimsy came across~! oh! so It tells me if people added things to their cart but never checked out ("abandoned" it)! If they put in their email address then it will send an email like 'hey! don't forget about this!'. good news, bad news
good news my bro was able to get funding to go research in Chile
bad news he's going to delay his graduation date as a result, therefore our incredibly dreamy plan for me to take next semester off and go to japan in the Fall is Off...maybe in the Spring . We talk about going "soon" but never do anything so I'm not shocked but when we thought of the plan I FUCKIN CRIED just imagine ..not going to school and going to japan instead?..that's the ddREAM LMFAOO oh well......maybe....someday orz. I'm glad my bro gets to do the research he's passionate about tho! He didn't get enough funding from his school but his advisor knew he was working so hard lately that he offered to fund the deficit ..so supportive!! And his long distance gf may go too . W..WHY ARE THE PEOPLE NEXT TO ME AT AX SO DAMN IMPRESSIVE. LRT SOMEONE BUY ME POCHACCO IN AN AIRPLANE FOR AX. casually gets lost in panic spiral for a full hour...ok time to..do smth else HAHA. Hello Jennifer! I’m also Jennifer - and I’m an illustrator!

I love characters and dabble in backgrounds, especially natural environments. You can see more of my work at  http:// cambrasine.art    and my email is  cambrasine @gmail.com

Thank you and good luck in your search!    pic.twitter.com/EhnOI4Sgwv. Mindlessly searched the bottom of my bed for my socks out of habit only to realize they’re still on my feet .. shocking. Outfit I bought w store credits  pic.twitter.com/q94xPfqWwQ. Y’KNOW FUNNY U SHOULD SAY THAT! I was thinking while I drew it that it kind of ended up looking like that too! While it wasn’t my intention, I’m happy for you to interpret it that way if ya want I read some trans kiribaku fics recently so maybe it leaked into my subconscious . Clothing: is mustard 
Me: . THANK U I intend to wear this every day for the next six months. Yes!! It makes such a nice palette . SARA!!! THANK YOU SO much!!   I love this..especially eel friend made me snort omg
Is it ok if I put this on my oc ref page w credit? No, no worries!   it was interesting to hear someone else thought that too!! American Eagle! It’s like sweatshirt-y and has a drawstring so you can wear it loose or cinch it in. super soft inside too . I just arrived home and it smells like sour cream wtf. I can’t believe there’s a whole ass donut on your shake I 
That’s 
A whole separate dessert as a garnish on a dessert. Crowdfunding ideas to set my friend up for a successful re-entry/transfer into college after some bad experiences and a year off!! As someone who historically struggles w school I had a lot and did some research but I’d love to hear from others, esp those who actually did that! THIS IS ACTUALLY REALLY GOOD INFO!! I was directing someone at AB about your work/table and referred to you as “A-belle” and then was immediately like “WAIT IDK IF THATS RIGHT”. /casually leaves these here

I hope you are able to get out of your art rut soon!! pic.twitter.com/pbaCadHx2j. Anyway my mom named the kayak we at the end of the season so now it’s Red Riot and The Cyan Siren LMFAOO pic.twitter.com/RegZ9AJ5KG. I COUldnt figure out why I felt so achey today and my mom just reminded me that we brought the kayaks down the hill and ow yeah. Cady casually fucking eating a tick. AAA Thank you so much for this really thoughtful response!! I really appreciate it! I had some of these ideas too, and others I'll add to the list! I especially think anticipating problems and coming up with solutions is great - I remember doing that when I was younger! hey Artist Alley friends!
I know it's impossible to predict whether a certain year will be good for sales, what will sell, etc. but if anyone is able to advise me just generally on /do you sell more at AX/ or compare it to a big con I've done like Anime Boston that'd be amazing. jennie guesses how much stock to order part 50239. aa someone else said 3 x too, and it's about 3x the attendance of AB too, so I'll keep that in mind! Thank you! Hnn yeah it's always a guessing game! Like you said, tons more attendees, but also tons more artists so it's a toss up!! Thank you for the input!! aa thank you so much!! 3 seems to be popping up a lot so I'll keep it around there and cut back a little if the numbers get too scary LMFAOO gotta spend money to make money. huh!! interesting!! I split my AB table this year and did about the same as last year even tho there were less artists, so I think splitting def factors in some! I wasn't able to display all my wares there. Thank you so much for the input!! <3. Just rambling now but I wonder if not being local will make a difference. Like people won’t know to look for me but also won’t own any of my old or new stuff unless they bought online since my furthest west cons before this were ACEN (Chicago) and Momo (Atlanta) last year. What the fuck did I just read 
Always shocked by new levels of low of how cons treat artists. I’m so sorry this happened to you, I hope someone higher up on the food chain tries to do right by you. Sometimes issues aren’t black and white but this clearly is. We all support you!! LRTs instead of punishing the dealer who was selling bootleg merch/a pin design stolen from this artist, ACEN staff instead threatened the artist with being booted from the con unless they deleted the viral tweet about the situation. Wow!! How low can you go? an*xt: here's some exhibitor info!
me: OHH ITS GOTTA BE THE MAP
an*xt: map available soon
me: :(. huge thank you to my past self for saving promo images as .psd files so I can just rip my designs off of them in groups instead of individually
(If i don't start my AX catalogue now it just won't happen so). Holy shit this is a good analogy. Fuuuck I fucking give up this headache won’t go away it’s been a day and a half I’m gonna take medicine ugh. It’s getting so out of hand. I feel like I have to write 40 disclaimers before I say anything and even then I’ll just X out instead cause I’m like “someone will have a fit about this and it could lead to being ostracized or death threats or —“. Hey if your apology doesn’t include “I’m sorry” you didn’t apologize you just wrote a bunch of shit 
Thanks. LMFAOOO my moms been wearing these shorts for like a month and just realized the pockets are?? Half seen shut??? I looked online and the model has her whole hand in the pocket so it’s definitely some insane defect pic.twitter.com/7VvYjkpKOP. *sewn obviously orz. @ vicunad  y’all are blowing my mind rn what the heck ok we shall try this . @ foreheadtouches  @vicunad  @DarksStars  LMFAO OK THERE WE GO...never in my 22 years.....well, thank y’all! You learn something new every day, huh. Ahh yeah we carefully used scissors  it’s wild that they do that. Yes we’ve established that I’m a fool. Life is Strange has me listening to this JAM again https:// m.youtube.com/watch?v=sy1dYF GkPUE   …. I think I need a break from browsing twitter ..so much discourse the past few days reading it is making me lose my mind. Seriously I’ve seen people tell people they deserve the electric chair on MORE THAN ONE ISSUE can y’all take a deep fucking breath or what. I wish I was exaggerating. Seriously they’re telling others they have a problem then wishing explicit violence on them I’m (insert math lady meme). OHH my sampler from spoonflower shipped y’all!! So excited to see all my patterns printed irl and approve them for sale!! Maybe it won’t make me any money but I wanted to try!   It’d be cool to make some passive income and see what people make w it. It says Thursday but NC isn’t so far, maybe it’ll come sooner . me: i'll quickly add this character to this set before I place my order

I ASKED MY MOM AND SHE SAID IKUTO TOO I'M -

She cycled thru my favorite shows from when I was younger (PPG, Kim Possible, etc.) but there really weren't any characters that stood out like a crush. I have absolutely no context for what Sarazanmai is but screenshots cover my TL every week. omg!! I told ya, the boys are popular!   I hope you get lots of preorders. Can’t tell if y’all liked this cause you watch it or bc we’re the same. Lrt I started to read this one day last week and just remembered!! I should keep going. Omg this is the ultimate test.

I feel that  Yeah, I’m trying to convince my mom that we will never use it in our house and that if she saw it in a store she’d say it’s ugly but I think it’s nostalgic for her orz even tho we have so many other things from my grandma. Phew! Spent roughly 3 hours last night and 4-5 hours today cleaning and sorting and there’s just so. Much. i feel simulataneously very accomplished and like we barely made a dent . i wish my mom didn’t keep so much crap from the last twenty years, then we ended up with a ton of my grandmas stuff bc my mom wanted a lot and then my uncle kept throwing perfectly good things away instead of taking or donating them so we ended up with. Most of it. I’ve been heavily enjoying these photos today! I’m glad you two finally made it safe and sound! . Most appear to be borrowed from “Fred”. Sorry, “Fred”. I stretched to avoid injury but instead injured myself while stretching and this was not the desired outcome. It’s 5:45 AM, I come on twitter to find I apparently did not mute enough words like I thought I did. aaa Feel better + good luck!! <3. good news: the plumber was really kind and undercharged us by ~half
bad news: we need to redo some pipes haha..ha.....fuck
and APPARENTLY the last guy bullshitted us bc the camera can't even make it down there to see if there's ANOTHER problem further along. usual tip jar: kiri's cute face
AX tip jar: fund new pipes and consequently new wall and flooring in my downstairs bathroom. OHHH !! GOOD FOR YOU TWO . Oof. Hnn I was supposed to maybe finally get pastel purple hair for my birthday but now that we had to pay the plumber and apparently need to do some expensive work so now I’m just. Stewing about it. me: HI YOU'RE ON THIS LIST AS ACCEPTING DONATIONS, CAN I GIVE U DONATIONS
first place: let me transfer you--- (to a voicemail)
second place: I...I have no idea what you're talking about ma'am
sdgfdh. I don’t have the physical energy to clean and I don’t have the mental energy to draw and I don’t want to do nothing either and I just feel lost and bad. Hagakure: spotted pic.twitter.com/Lsn3WEXJUn. Wump wamp . Just used another store credit gosh I love recycled money. Heh I know what the kids are into . SAME I was just really enjoying it at face value, not thinking about plot twists and then I was like “did I just have an aneurysm or”. Click! pic.twitter.com/2RDTOxtQgX.

THANK YOU, I AM TRYING VERY HARD TO LEARN!! my goodness there’s like 409584728 types of slime . OHH!! Interesting! That explains why I saw someone doing a giveaway of them. Well —YOU CAN DO IT! And then REST - yknow, as much as you can while tabling! I’m glad you’re staying hydrated tho. I feel like no one will care but I kinda wanna draw LIS 2 fan art...I was enjoying it but feeling a bit underwhelmed but y’all episode 3 GOT ME. LMFAO IM TIRED I thought I had a Great spot for Anext but I didn’t see the column of booth numbers to the left   Still a corner tho - and not in the absolute back like the other time I was there when people couldn’t find me

Good luck this weekend!! Aa that’s what I’ve heard - but sometimes Fridays are bad sales days  I hope it picks up!! . Second tweet about this but my god the ticks this year!! Went kayaking today and usually I fish an ant or spider or two out of the boat first but I had to stop and get half a dozen ticks out?! GUHH. Finally swam!!! It’s supposed to be HOT tomorrow so I’m excited!! It was a bit too chilly to stay in long today pic.twitter.com/I2SCF46PRR. Y’all are so cute!! Omg. Yeah?! I’ve known some zines that they were like not gonna print the zine just make the merch and it’s like uh is it really a zine project then. I’m a poorly designed human who can’t spend an hour in the sun without feeling flushed and getting a headache. My worst nightmare. Gomenasorry. I am in a good Italian food dead zone it’s like 20 mins to every place and I am craving fettuccini Alfredo . I am Desperate and therefore trying a place 10 mins away that was not at all memorable but I didn’t remember disliking it so here’s hoping. UPDATE THEIR DESSERT SPECIAL IS CHOCOLATE MOUSSE so Not to curse myself but I feel like at least one of them will be good omg. Beautiful sunset
Can’t wait til it’s warm enough to swim at this time aaaaaaa pic.twitter.com/Z48Uy2qagx. Ready for my hot takes of the night
> Is it really an Italian restaurant if you don’t serve bread
> Homemade chips are bad. Everywhere, all the time. They are just crunchy burnt-taste. @ ghostvom  . No problem!! Uh I found my box of dress up stuff from childhood name all three fandoms pic.twitter.com/llQsH1Ma42.

I think we’re all suckers for a good sunset u by. * u vu. Oof... Safe travels!! HNNGNDND why is this like a representation of literally my whole TL lately 
P1: does smth someone doesn’t agree with 
P2: threatens actual and extreme violence disproportionate to the transgression. Shoutout to the weather for being bad after I get my hair dyed so I don’t have to worry about wanting to swim right away. AGSHDGKFJ W H AT. I . I hope that’s all sorted out. Rest In Peace Kitty   I’m so sorry Liz.. Losing a pet is so heartbreaking. Sending you good vibes love.  noooooo this is my favorite dress pic.twitter.com/PoLeNdaoRz. Hello I am tired I wanted to see the string leg banana fish plush and I googled this expecting???? pic.twitter.com/QwABXNyHjW. “Wow I can’t believe that didn’t work” - my dumbass brain probably. I love this tweet cause it makes me wonder what (or who) you saw that prompted it. Suddenly there’s attack on titan on my TL from multiple people am i in a time warp. Pffff she did it, folks!! That percentage of survival seems generous. Ohh~~ so mysterious~~~. Oh! I got off the An*me USA waitlist...any friends been there before? Worth the trip from MA? . No shame here!! Own it!! . THATS A STRONG RESPONSE FRIEND. I for sure do not have that. OOF no thank u. Aaa thank you friend! Yeah another friend said only if I have free room and travel and I def don’t so!! Thank you for the heads up! Thank you for the warning!! AU where Youmacon ever opens apps . aaa see ya there!! OH...I don’t know if i have any more   I can check when I clean/pack but outlook not good and I already placed my order   I’m sorry!! Ok!! Next time I order stands I’ll get some so I have it for the future~~ . (Softly) flag tag? Shdbdhdhs I hope this takes pic.twitter.com/vJolmsPYG5. I ALMOST CRIED SJBDBD I GOTTA FUCKIN WAIT TIL ITS DONE BEFORE I GO GETTING EXCITED. IF IT DOES ILL LOSE MY MIND IN THE BEST WAY. Ahshdjdh thank u . Deadass just staring at my reflection while it processes, willing it to take. Aaa I saw your hair struggles recently   I’ll pour one out. IT’S.....SUBTLE............ pic.twitter.com/gpExzlBFAK. P much   Maybe I’ll try to put more vibrant purple color depositing conditioner over it in a few weeks or smth . I’m trying not to be bummed out that it looks like candy color hair is Not Happening but it’s very soft and romantic, gotta lean in to whatever happens yknow  sometime I’ll try halfway between this and the too bright/dark purple from last time and it’ll be more medium at least. Sometimes I wonder if the Cheesecake Factory has a better chocolate cake than this one and then I think - that’s not possible  pic.twitter.com/u9VBuxxzPA. I just want it in-between these!!  pic.twitter.com/eEgcjmmm7h. You’re right tho It is soft and pretty  — I’ll kill it in an instant with sunshine and pond water so it’s just as well haha. Huh. That’s odd! I wonder what it is about it..I guess November is a weird time but ANYC has no trouble . Mm yeah the table is like 150 which isn’t unreasonable but uh when not one but two people say “only go if it doesn’t cost you anything else” it’s not reassuring. Friday!! I think my hair just..won’t do the thing orz. i am really treating myself today
or more like
spoiling myself 
and I should stop LMFAO. I saw something nice on twitter and I said aloud “oh, that’s nice” ...this place has been a hellscape lately . I had a dream Cady laid on my grandmas legs and 1. My grandma hated animals (Sorry Cade, Pichi made the cut but you were too hype) 2. Cady cuddles when she feels like it but doesn’t do the whole laying on ya thing since she was a puppy   it’s truly tragic. Aa my supplier sent me pics of the heart buttons to confirm which is really nice but for some reason just one design in this set looks way bigger and Immmm like ?? I def didn’t do that . Yay!! Congrats!! Wasn’t that thing a total shitshow tho. I recently donated a ton to an anime convention for staff prizes!! That way it finds a happy home and you don’t have to deal w the anxieties of “is it ok to resell this” and shipping!! Could also add as extra freebies if u ever are selling old official merch too. Set a reminder   or send them in bulk to a friend like flat rate or smth and have them do it ? I really leaned into the anxiety and depression today, didn’t get out of bed til 3:30 and just ate. I’m gonna Not Do That Again bc it does Not make you feel better and like..I know that but maybe I needed the reminder. I got this on the first try I’m so upset pic.twitter.com/1dxnjjrjMa. I just ordered heart buttons but now i...want make more orz. Nothing to take you out of anime like WELCOME TO MOOOEEEE’S ad coming on 3 times in a row on crunchy. Y’ALL I JUST LEARNED THAT..this guy - who I thought was wasabi - is actually a piece of fake grass from a bento, who he dreams of being part of a beautiful bouquet ... I’m not crying you’re crying  pic.twitter.com/qLDF1ngUka. Also I desperately want to understand and match everyone’s excitement so I started watching KnY again!!! Idk how many episodes y’all are up to - I’m only on 5 so far . I...I LOVE MY BIG BRO AND IT WAS VERY KIND AND UNEXPECTED THAT HE'S MAILING ME A BDAY GIFT BUT..he sent it F*dEx??? I'm sure USPS would've been cheaper ..poor big bro i have to teach him about shipping . lrt not much of a gamer but the death not being game over and every kill having a consequence is so interesting * O*. I remember in middle/high school how many likes you got on fb posts/pics was such a huge deal and now I update my profile pic twice a year, get like 6 likes, and go “yeah that sounds about right, I have about 6 friends and relatives” . Wow,, dealing w all that heat,,, must be.........hard. Couldn’t be more mild outside today if it tried. It..it costs almost that much to Make a charm depending on supplier/materials......... Yeah!! Even just going to cons is hard work!! And then there’s also the issue of undercutting other artists - even if it’s unintentional a customer will think “They’re selling theirs for $2.50, why should I pay $10 or $12 for yours?”. Aaa a bit early here, but still very much appreciated !!  Thank you! So happy to see someone charging reasonable rates for their hard work!! . (Sorry I’m half asleep from a nap - I mean I’m happy you’re not underselling yourself). Not sure if I’m too late but!! pic.twitter.com/vmRJOjUVI5. Oh!! I always forget but first oc also has mermaid form!  Thank you for looking!! pic.twitter.com/fKV7Gf5bBN. Mm I took a nap bc I deprived myself of sleep (oops) and I feel sooo sleepy and dreamy and I’m up and about but not being productive but I’m worried if I wake myself up fully I’ll feel anxious again. Yes!! Definitely! I sometimes think of doing commissions but then I see half the world charging $25 for a full body and I’m like uhhh I’m not doing anything close to that   ahahaha. ?! (What’s going on?). Fuck, y’all, my nap was so good. It was the most peaceful sleep I’ve had in a while - I didn’t move At All - I woke in the exact same position I fell asleep in. I assume there’s some sort of mating dance involved. Lrt he blushy u wu. LMFAOO u ok buddy /pats
(They are soo pretty tho!!). Should I get this for my tablecloth???  I forget who it was but I saw someone get their own pattern for theirs and I thought THATS FREAKING GENIUS pic.twitter.com/ndAYHzYQ3e. Thank you!  ....I made a really elaborate banner but I didn’t order it yet so now I’m thinking that should be...way simpler. Sneak peek at smth I’ve been working on! There’s more goodies and surprises to come  pic.twitter.com/kjRlzkLC85. I got sucked down the rabbit hole of indie artist toys and I wish I was at Five Points this weekend . AHFDISGTFH why would u offer this, my wallet and I are CRY/iNG
I'll see if I can find out prices so I can pick smth and get back to you!! If you end up being too busy tho I won't blame you!! <3 <3. hnn yeah;; in AA I'm used to fairly standardized pricing but with these I'm like? ??? WHAT AM I LOOKING AT $40? $80? $200? LMFAO. AAA I love them! Also yeah if you have any recs of people to follow I'm just now dipping my toes in so!! AA WELL...YOU SHOULD!! (If you want to!!)
Thank you!! I think I'm gonna go for it!! aaaa yeah I don't think I could indulge much more than that;; Not that they're not worth it just!! Yknow... $ TT A TT
OH Thank you! That's a good idea, I'll do that! I already followed like a dozen artists from the listing online haha. Mmm!! Agreed!! Thank you for the recs, I'll def check them out!! I will most likely be in touch ((eyes emoji). Pudding would be easier to make . ok I just dropped $ for a tablecloth, pray it looks good cause I'm not doing it again lmfaoo. OHH ALSO I ALMOST AM CAUGHT UP ON THE KNY ANIME I thought it was further in bc of the fan content I’ve seen...are ALL y’all reading the manga?! . 3 AN thought is there should be a kickstarter for boob window clothing that is designed for small-chested humans

All I want in life is a heart shaped titty window top to fit. ...is it? I guess I’ve only tried it on here . Aaaaa!! Thank you Tania . They’re puffy and cute! pic.twitter.com/F8jJVez3da. Aaaa thank you friend!! The plan was to go to the beach but it was a bit cool so we did the dune trails!! Somehow I’ve never been on them before..I hope to go back soon and do some other routes! pic.twitter.com/3h7j0GCb71. Crane Beach in Ipswich, MA! Well, this is the trails there - same parking lot tho. Aaa thank you!! THE MOON IS NEON PINK SOMEONE WITH A GOOD CAMERA PLS PHOTOGRAPH pic.twitter.com/vJIABuwlZE. WAIT NO THE SUN?? Idk it was weird is all I know. I think it was just the sun behind a lot of haze but it was cool!! It was so bizarre. Lmfaoo I forgot my brothers girlfriend and I have the same birthday so then we were suddenly yelling HAPPY BIRTHDAY at each other on FaceTime . Ohh I have the same birthday as p*nimelt that’s p rad. I keep saying Kimetsu no Yabai instead of Yaiba I apologize in advance. received an insane all text email from an*mate japan and was like ???? and it took me a minute to realize it was a 10% off coupon for being born in June (close..) LMFAO. it's a red flag if a con is emailing you telling you to apply to their AA when getting into cons has become so competitive..esp. when they say they had over 100k attendees....at their 2020 event....................friendly reminder that it's 2019 still. me, tugging my wristband in ten directions: what's the quick way to get this off, I forget.
mom: scissors. Ok this needs to be a twitter thread - We all - as children - accidentally broke one incredibly precious object which devestated our parents/family. What is your story? Nezuko is really cute but pls someone explain her hair to me
My brain says there’s like fabric tied to the ends but I think it’s just like....dip dyed ??? He l p. Animenext is soon. I have Not Prepared enough. My new tablecloth won’t be here til after Anext :( I didn’t wanna pay over $20 to rush it. Hahaha oh my..must have been one heck of a plush! . Ahahha not exactly a fool proof alibi . My mom can’t remember any incidents with me, but she herself broke the lid to my grandma’s favorite teapot and my brother broke a really cool ornament . omg I had about a thousand of these mock pets that woofed and meowed   Something tells me you didn't get a good deal though haha. SGOJDTHYFH H..HOW WEAK WAS THE DOOR?? OR HOW STRONG WERE YOU?? before I can prep for anext.. I GOTTA FILL THESE ONLINE PREORDERS 
working on it now!!! Ow I really indulged on food yesterday and my tummy is unhappy ... mozzarella sticks, roast beef, ice cream, fried chicken, and mac n cheese.... dairy, red meat, and fried food....I am a fool.

Some package doodles! pic.twitter.com/bCbF1E0xEl.  Hope to see ya there!! aaa yeah like the ED where the boys are running around seems like such fun and really disconnected from what's currently happening haha. In the past I have made it so you can preorder merch online and pick it up at a con..I can't decide if that's a GOOD idea for AX bc it's so crazy, or a BAD idea bc it's so crazy. thoughts? fdsgHYJ KIRI'S OUTFIt. mom: ..Would you take a train?
me: A train?! A train is much less scary than a plane! a TRAIn is on the ground. I used to get stressed out by how many plastic bags I had from the charm supplier sorting out each design and now that they fucking don’t and I have to do it well at least I have BAGS FOR THEM . I JUST SORTED OUT A GIANT BAG AND FRANKLY IM exhausted. Are you BakuHO or a BakuBRO? Take the quiz to find out! Anime Bakugou. Gosh I should rewatch this. AAA I'm glad I checked on b*yee bc they didn't email me?! the boys need to come home, how could they-- (string leg plush))). Damn, there goes every lifeguard fanfic :(. OOF I felt this tweet  
I hope your head feels better soon . If this isn’t a mood idk what is. UPDATE?! IT SHIPPED?! It says it’ll be here by Wednesday night!! I bet it’ll be late bc it’s F*dEx but the possibility makes me really happy . I’m so mad it was supposed be like 65 and raining and it’s 77 and sunny and I wanna swim but that’s not how I structured the day . WHY IS THIS SO CUTE. LRT THEIR ARMS ARE ALSO STRING HOLY SHIT. Tfw you’re doing inventory and you come home from a con with 1 more of an item than you left with . Yesss I just went through my print box and found all these goodies from AB!!!

I'D BE HAPPY TO DO IT I JUST DONT WANNA SET U UP FOR DISAPPOINTMENT SINCE IDK WHAT IM GETTING MYSELF INTO W THIS CON <3. AWHDHDH my goodness, are we gonna have to put you in a bubble? . i've been sooo easily distracted lately.. I'm gonna..maybe actually freaking draw now. I STARTED WATCHING CAROLE AND TUESDAY AND WOW ITS REALLY CUTE and the singers have such pretty voices damn. Oh my, the crop on mobile makes this like one of those “click for a surprise” posts . LRT I FUCKING KNEW DEKU WAS POCHACCO I doodled Sanrio x BNHA chibis a billion years ago and now I wanna revisit . can't figure waht the fuck color to make yuki's hair (glances anxiously between fruits basket  2001 and fruits basket 2019). listening to a very soft kiribaku playlist while drawing. @ buzzfeed get on this . hnnn also banana fish manga vs anime .  mostly Eiji and his head full of bangs pic.twitter.com/D7oxEkrvhO. What an amazing next step!!  congratulations!! my bro and I got my mom credit at this massage place for christmas and she insists I use part of it and I was gonna deflect and make her go today instead but now I did hurt my back yesterday and I'm like shit guess i'm doing this. pro tip: if you're weak don't move a kayak, kayak, do extra stretches, lift a suitcase full of prints, and then sit slouched on the couch for hours drawing. I’m nervous as heck . It begins pic.twitter.com/69hh7GaLBB. That was 
Amazing. Carole and Tuesday, Kimetsu no Yaiba, and Sarazanmai seem to be what’s on my feed this season. Now ya know! . Damn she even massaged my jaw and scalp bless her. Aaa I knew there must be another word for them other than “fuzzy” . I’m gonna put in another order in hopes of getting it for AX so if you want in lemme know! i'm p much done w tohru but I can't figure out what things to put in the pattern behind her..obviously rice ball but idk what for the second thing..the other charas have one larger and one smaller icon so trying to do different kinds of rice balls the same size instead looked bad. follow up: did I say I'd ask you last time?! bc if I did I forgot until literally just now and i'm so sorry. i would take bust heart button commissions if i ever had time
and by having time  i mean if i had time management skills. lomaking new signs but i looked at the word each too long and now it feels fake. Hn. Feeling this. . /drops off the kids pic.twitter.com/m4B7xJMYAt. I know this is a hot take so I apologize but re:spoilers my god does everyone in the ML universe need to be a miraculous holder?! It was such a big deal abt him picking Mari and Adrien and then ok the other main cast but it’s like ..ok three side characters? E...nough. Like Alya fine good I get it, nino whatever, Chloe I like what they did with her whole situation but ...pls stop not everyone can or should be a superhero . It’s like when people take photos with their puppies but then the puppies grow up and they try to take the photo again except now the dog is too big . Me, after two days w a bandaid on: wow look how quickly wounds heal when you don’t anxiously pick at them. Aaa,You mean with Alix? Yeah I was a bit put off but at least w her there was like ..the miraculous being her watch was like ok maybe they did think about this way back when but everyone else ?   idk... Uh my birthday present from my big bro arrived and it Sounds bad like it may be broken so I’m scared to open it. Update they only broke a little so it’s ok!! Also he should not be allowed to write cards he’s two for two on making us cry  pic.twitter.com/WMmmBSSe2z. AA DID I SPOIL YOU?! I’m sorry, it’s so hard w the episodes airing sporadically all over the world but I should’ve been more careful. ok tohru's eyes are 2001 color bc it looks better on this button, don't@me. if I write $5 each and + $2 flat rate shipping
do you understand 
LMFAOO my mom and i are in disagreement. "I don't wanna be asked if it's $7 per button all weekend" - my mom. Hehe yes!! Her argument was that people don’t know what flat means but \o/ only time will tell! Tiny sample results looking good tho . LRT THIS FUCKING KILLED ME . Thankfully St*ples is near the Arboretum and it magically wasn’t buggy so we popped over..I used to live across the street from this place and I miss it so much.

ITS EPIC AF.  aa thank you for the support!!! . my mom and I are testing new system for sales at cons and testing each other by making the most obnoxious orders. Literally already tweeted this but I want a fruits basket cosplay café
I don’t wanna do it but I sure do want it to happen. I also liked this earlier...Why the fuck would he think this was a good move. Gee she sounds lovely   
I’m sorry you were subjected to this negativity . aaa I wanna make cool LED stands!!! SOUNDS FREAKIN EXPENSIVE
But cool
...KnY? ,,,,,G..given?? those two seem suited to it... i need time to read them.. my mom is reading the Jewish Journal and really getting a kick out of it..they have a section called "Menschtions". Oh fuck uh somehow I only have 3 kiribaku hand fans left..Should I be reordering for AX? I hate to have none of them since they apparently sold well but also minimum is 50 pic.twitter.com/EKM4Rqiu2r. GUHH I don’t wanna spend the $ but they’re pretty cute . HNHHHNDJFJDJ IDK. Also I have like 20 todo deku left probably   I know what people follow me for but damn show them some love .  aaa thank you!!  I should have tododeku but I wonder if I can get the other in time. Aa you too citra, for what made you tweet this feeling that too many of us are familiar with . Omg I’ve seen signs at rest stops here explicitly ban it. Lrt you know what else she is? Cute as hell. YKNOW WHY ?! SHE IS GIVING OFF NEJIRE VIBES. Me before Pokémon direct: heh easy I want shield!! (Pushes glasses up nose like a cocky megane character)

Me, after seeing a dog w a sword in its mouth: fuck wait I -. Also TMI but I feel thirsty but my pee (and the fact that I’m have to pee every five seconds) says in OVERhydrated   is that even possible for me, my goodness. I’m loving this concept. How does be bork w a sword in his mouth??? I need to know. THIS IS ME AT EVERY CON BUT IM DEHYDRATED SOMEHOW. Ugh no yeah I think this is common probbaly   my lips get really chapped too.. Tablecloth arrived!!  pic.twitter.com/846FgAKObs. It’ll probably be a little overwhelming this time bc I intend to get a vertical banner that will cut something plain into the tabletop and top of the front  but..I don’t have it yet. THANK YOU!!! Also safe travels - I’ll see ya there!! THANK YOU!! I’d make pencil pouches or smth but I can’t sew to save my life . Tfw you leave for a con the next day but it’s 80 degrees out . Also repping @punimelt pic.twitter.com/KlTBahMscH. I decided it was time to be productive, put my left hand on what I thought was the left arm of the chair but was actually the right - and tried to sit down next to the chair instead of on it, whacked 5 different parts of my back, butt and arm so now I’m icing them in rotation :|. Aaa thank you I will!! I adore it!! . Make that 6. Yep!!! I’ll still have them   I really hope they arrive in time tho . Thank you   I hope they don’t hurt too much the next couple days but at least it’s my non dominant arm this time . Every convention I pack two fancy outfits in case I have the energy to get fancy dinner and every convention I use 0 of them . I haven’t been to Animenext for a few years - anyone remember if it’s notoriously hot or cold in the AA? That’s usually the case! Thank you!! “Is that banana fish?” 
“It is!!”
“Just checking”
There’s two guys at Staples into anime and one helped us dropping off the order and the other helped us when picking up . DAMN OK. THESE ARE SO PRECIOUS. Makes my nose run and hands freeze off :(. Catch me wearing the same omocat sweatshirt four days in a row. @ whoever is trying to hack my Reddit: honestly why. I think I’ve made 3 posts there ever it feels like a lot of effort for absolutely no pay-off. I wanna draw cute Pokémon stuff but con crunch. I WISH THIS WASNT RELATABLE..i did this once on bumble just for making friends. I got so flustered when someone matched that I closed it and never opened it again. Y E S!!!! Omg heart heart pin.. I want Deku’s All Might ice cream it’s sooo cute!! It’s impossible to actually leave for a con bc you think being done packing means you can go but then turns out you have to clean the whole house. ((Glances at fruits basket designs)) .......... If I get to print them then maybe I’ll come by and we can exchange food/money for buttons? We’ll see tho  (ALSO U SHOULD MAKE PEOPLE PRESS THEIR OWN YOURE GONAN WRECK YR BODY ALREADY BY CARRYING IT). My body hurts so much from falling on my ass yesterday and they were so loud w the construction today
RIP setting up today. (Drops these here~) pic.twitter.com/9sIcP8TNSA. pic.twitter.com/rAR3LXFuIO. My dream was like a Kingsman x Umbrella Academy x Barry crossover. Point is Taron Egerton and his loved ones kept getting M*rdered and it was very stressful.  aaaa thank you!! I’m glad you like them!!  thank you friend!! Glad you like my kids ahah. Literally had to hide half the treats bc I know the dog watcher will give them all to Cady in theee days lmfao. I thought I packed lightly but then i was like oh I need special shampoo and conditioner, oh we need raincoats, oh the heating pad would be nice if I get my period, oh they said it’s cold I’ll bring these extra heavy pants —- etc and now my bag is bursting for theee days lmfao. I AM HAVING THE SAME EXPERIENCE MY FRIEND. I LOVE THESE KIDSSS. Casually leaving 9 hours later than planned. Rude. To be fair we just like, cleaned the whole house lmfaoo. I have the kiri from an earlier set of this brand of plush but I don’t remember the brand/store.. This is the most odd looking Arby’s but I’m digging the pattern on the tabletops   It feels like the 90’s and fittingly they’re playing Goo Goo Dolls pic.twitter.com/oF5N6wqqs3. Yeah!! It’s also just bizarre bc not only is it so old fashioned but the colors are??? So not Arby’s colors. Lmfaoo people keep saying it reminds them of places I’ve never heard of . Me and this guy desperately trying to get the attention of these rest stop dunks employees :(. Oh!! I’ll have to ask my bro, he went to school there! Update he had to pee and gave me his blessing to go ahead. Update he came back, someone from the back said it’d be another five minutes. A third person arrived. First guy gave up and left, employee appeared and was very nice. I ate a whole donut yolo. Lmfaoooo tried to let this truck go bc two ones are closed on the bridge and about eight drivers all from NJ cut around us so he couldn’t go anyway   I’m sorry i know MA has a bad rep but NJ y’all drive the most aggressive and that’s just a fast. Omg I told my friend we were going to NJ and completely unprompted his response was “I hope you’ll be ok with the crazy drivers” . I need 1000% more fanfics based on the same premise as Centerfold by J. Geils Band. ANYWAY WE HAVE SEEN LITERALLY TWENTY DEER AND WE ARE NEVER GOING TO ARRIVE. Twenty six what is happening. Apologies in advance for being late/tired/only half present tomorrow   
Also the final deer count was 34, 3 rabbits, and a raccoon for those of you keeping score at home. :O drawing is hard!! But I don’t think there a wrong way to draw my friend!! I AM LATE BUT /throws cute girls@u pic.twitter.com/Mg4bssXCl9. My mom snores so fucking loudly that my phone at the furthest end of the room still fucking heard her all morning.. as you’d imagine I am Not Rested   I even wore ear plugs...ugh be gentle w me today y’all pic.twitter.com/1Q7dUntkWP. Also GOOD NEWS!! I got into MICE (through my school)!!   I assumed I didn’t since I hadn’t heard and the semester ended but HUZzahhhh!!! Also for clarification my sleep app automatically records samples of you snoring I’m not an insane person who recorded my mom for three hours. This is why we try to get an Airbnb we separate rooms but it was so expensive this time so here we are   ok gonna stop moping about my shitty sleep and get up...I’ll be set up a bit late. EHDBDHDJ I almost get hit quite a bit back home so I can’t imagine. Me: ah 76 outside 
Me: sweatpants, long sleeve shirt, sweatshirt in preparation for the artist alley. Oof I’ll be arriving when the alley opens which Isn’t ideal. I haven’t been THIS late in a while I’m sorry. . DELAYED TWEET BUT IM MOSTLY SET UP. Phew!! All set up at #AnimeNEXT  #ANEXT  Artist Alley table E12 

Come say hi!! If you don’t see what you’re looking for just ask!  pic.twitter.com/xSmiRK5Wfe. Quick table tour video!! pic.twitter.com/IQJK7n7wGY. Mom: im gonna leave and without a phone 
Me: ok!!
Me, two seconds after: .....I need to pee. LMFAOO and it was intentional even...we are fools. pic.twitter.com/IFwuQQVaxb. I haven’t been able to find my foam Kiri face I so painstaking hand crafted for my tip jar since Zenkai :(. Hello if you see these at Animenext pls tell me   idk if kiri plush was released yet or not pic.twitter.com/L5Uc6aAt4K. I haven’t read/watched BNHA, KnY, or Carole and Tuesday this week#the grind. EHDNDKDN
GONNA BE ABPUT 15 MINS LATE BC OUR AIRBNB HOST APPEARED SUDDENLY AND WANTED TO CHAT. My hand was on the handle to the car when he popped out it was such a near thing friends. For some reason the alley opened like 30 mins late so I was fine... When banana fish cosplayers walk directly by your table   baby come back. Idk how autographs work but if u r allowed to get > 1 thing signed, if someone wants to get smth signed at the MAPPA sesh for me I will give u free merch!!!

My bro will be out of grad school next year so maybe we’ll go   I’m glad you’re having a good time tho! I saw it was a bit rocky at the start.  Got out from behind the booth and did some shopping! @shiroiroom  @ghostspacess pic.twitter.com/NtGWa2JjsT. Tfw you’re not sure if the dark under your eyes is smudged eyeliner or if you’re just fucking tired pic.twitter.com/PBo32lB4uX. I can’t believe I’m almost out of Kiri plush! I ended up with even more than the minimum because of a manufacturing error and they lived in giant bags in my house so it’s surreal that they’re almost gone . I FOUND HIM !!! Tip jar Kiri!! I left my jar at home since he was lost so..please bring me a jar today or tomorrow and I’ll give u merch!! #animenext  #anext pic.twitter.com/SElxJnYjnZ. Aaaa that’d be so lovely!! I’ll definitely write here about it if I do!! I wanted to go with my family but it wasn’t possible while my bro was in school but now . pic.twitter.com/iGwwletZdt. OOF!! No particular order: tragic gays Nezumi and Shion (NO.6) and Ash and Eiji (Banana Fish) plus Kirishima x Bakugou who BETTER HAVE A HAPPY ENDING even if they’re not canon
I have a lot of ships but these ones give me the most feelings . 1. Chocolate Tower Truffle Cake from Cheesecake Factory (or similarly overly rich chocolate cake)
2. Chocolate Ice Cream - particularly Ben & Jerry’s Chocolate Fudge Brownie and (local) White Farms’ Chocolaye PB Cup
3. Black & White Frappe (Vanilla ice cream + choco syrup). Narrator: it wasn’t maybelline. Omg this requires some brain power lemme eat dinner first . YESSS GUHH   there’s so little merch of them too rip
I never finished the manga so I really have to get around to it. ABDJDJDNF I don’t wanna take away from your set up my friend !! In the end my favorite moments are the classics for him (“your hand can still reach him!” “come!” And his badass fight that I won’t spoil for season 4 in case you don’t read the manga) so here’s just 3 panels of him being adorable  pic.twitter.com/fcIPSvtNsU. Aaa thank you!! . Lmfaoo sorry anext alley rules dictate you just have a minimum of two (2) jars. Aa good good cause I realized after I posted that there were sort of spoilers in those panels . Aaa I heard fireworks but couldn’t see them :( such a bummer. GOOD. A*rbnb Host: so, did you sell anything today?
Me: ..Y-yes. TMI Saturday My laundry pile is located in the middle of the floor, contains 3 (one is clean?!) pairs of underwear, four socks, and $2 in ones. aaa having fun looking at all my Boston friends' pride parade photos from today!! me: tries to reply to a tweet
me: accidentally hits unfollow instead on a locked account. Holy shit congrats friend, that’s amazing!!! Just sent in an application for something a little bit different!   Wish me luck! I am too afraid of commitment to even use a cork board and yet this person at ANEXT deadass stuck their enamel pins into their frosted storage cubes. Bold as fuck. It’s really suited to my tastes and they said graphic design, illustration, or fine art, but based on their current stuff I’m wondering if they’ll lean more towards graphic design..  We’ll see! THANK YOU!  Thank you! At Ota a customer said they intended to give something they bought from me to a popular cosplayer as a gift and I thought that was cute as hell so I gave them a second for free to keep for themself and wonder if they succeeded in meeting them.. What I should’ve said: we should get up earlier so we’re not 15 minutes late again
What I did say: ooooh we should get up earlier so we can get Dunks!!! Zzz I’m fucking
Tired. Will be about 10 minutes late bc I laid in bed for 10 minutes thinking about how I was tired. Oof feeling this rn. “What’s 100 that symbol mean”
“Oh that says 100 yen but the prices are on the sign and I’ll give you a token”
“So it’s like...a dollar?”
ALSO HOW DO U KNO THE CONVERSION RATE BUT NOT THE SYMBOL. LMFAOOO our dog watcher got a puppy recently and Cady is looking So Done pic.twitter.com/xlJrSIf1HW. She’s like “that’s e-fucking-nough, kids these says amirite”. YES SOMEONE TOLD ME!! THANK U FOR LOOKING OUT FOR ME!!  I just feel like I can find him cheaper and I’m not as antsy for him as I am for the plush . Oof usually I get a headache one day of a con but I’ve gotten one each day this con varying in length and intensity shdbdh. CASUALLY FORGETS SOMEONE TOOK A BEST SELLER OFF THE BOARD LAST — I HAVE MORE! Oops #animenext  #anext pic.twitter.com/PUQ0wAlXfy.

A couple people have asked about cosplaying my oc and if anyone follows through I will actually explode with happiness . Deadass about to buy these shoes that are my current shoes plus soles w traction and minus the holes in the toes pic.twitter.com/29ltwuaeVG. Update I didn’t buy them bc they weren’t as comfy. I call this piece “migraine at sunset” pic.twitter.com/zD4zywIasQ. I tried..  pic.twitter.com/Fzu7oCmhOj. Also a huge truck came over halfway into our lane on a turn, then saw a man do a backbend to narrowly avoid being hit by a taxi. Rest stop stretching 
Me: legit stretching 
My mom: mocking me, waving her arms in the air
Me: exaggerated stretch
My mom: dabs. Light sensitivity bros. AHDBDKFKF I can’t even argue w that. I couldn’t not have him
So handsome. Thank you!! Eyes are watering from the liGHT. Apparently this is a thing, pls tell me where my style falls!! pic.twitter.com/VQ0jomMv1E. I call my style “non-committal”. Cady greeted us at the door   I know most dogs do that but on a daily basis she doesn’t bother so!! . Also shoutout to whoever did the illustration and graphic design for the ANEXT booklet this year that shit was . I restrained myself from buying much but did do some trades so I’ll post a haul in a while. Mmm tea pic.twitter.com/azlMxphFAj. I just walked from the door to the car and nature did me dirty :(. Lrt the fucking crocs I’m . This Shorter plush has pastel purple hair and honestly that was a good as heck design choice pic.twitter.com/di1O4MClVW.

I'm enjoying looking through your haul thread ahah. me, looking at all the charms I have after anext: AHH there's way too many 
me, having actually counted the charms: ...I don't think this is enough for AX. psa all my tweets for the next month will be AX stress tweets. i'm glad banana fish was so popular at anext but some things that normally sell well barely sold at all LMFAOO LOOKS LIKE I JUST THREW A LOT OF POLAROID CHARMS INTO THE CROWD. me: I'll keep track of every single item sold all weekend!
math: three digit discrepancy

WHAT DO YOU MEAN THAT'S FALSE ADVERTISING??? pic.twitter.com/LGFyP4f69u. Same pic.twitter.com/rI0vZVYVVx. HONESTLY U SHOULD....Kyo at least. cady is INSANE for red meat ..I don't eat it often but when I do she sits next to me and huffs and puffs. Ahahha does your cat meow at you? Cady was in such a deep sleep but even then she smells it and pops up immediately.. sgrdgtrh fruits basket is getting so  
I don't think I read all of the manga back in the day..or if I did I don't remember it so I'm just AA I WANT MORE.. I'm glad the reactions to TINF give you the warm fuzzies - cause that's what TINF gives all of us!!!  . should rewatch banana fish or finish the manga but ..it's so painful. The electric company is ..infuriating. Trying to meet my friend but we’re trapped in our street and “In 20 minutes if you *need* us to move we’ll move,” no notice, again . Will slowly be posting promos but put some stuff on sale, including the last of this #yurionice  merch, most of which has been discounted  pic.twitter.com/nSDYQ4gPkR. pic.twitter.com/BnFK3wVWWa. Aaa thank you for giving him a home!! They have all found homes!! Thank you so much everyone!! I saved a couple in case of missing packages so hopefully everything will go well and I’ll throw those guys up in a month or so.  https:// twitter.com/cambrasine/sta tus/1138300400468189184   …. My goodness!! Rest!! Stretch!! I’m looking forward to seeing this though . I agree w Ria just slightly discount them - people will def buy!! (Ps these are soooo cute!!). Zzz ok yesterday and today I did inventory but otherwise took a break so back to getting shot done tomorrow . Eiji c4? ...bunnies are cute . I’m always thinking this too.. I watched a video the other day about how they (machine) screen print spot gloss. (Electric company employees swinging a telephone pole around, hovering over our driveway)
Mom: uhh do you need me to move my car?
Employee: ..How do you like your car? 
Mom: I love it
Employee: ok, I won’t drop it on it then. Aaa I told my friend he did well in picking out the card and turns out I already follow the artist  pic.twitter.com/5EXGcIu3G0. sorry i've like 10000 pictures of nessa and counting. when I searched nessa and sonia this is not the shit i was looking for yikes pic.twitter.com/yw2BzopnVR. I thought it was a joke account at first but turns out no the internet is just a hellscape. He’s the hero we need in this world. It must be hard for them to keep up the account with how few straight characters there are in media.. oh wait . They’re trying so hard. Just a little thank you about Fantasy Kiri plush!!  pic.twitter.com/uXu5qG0Wg0. Gays in Grass, Parts 1 and 2. it's ok bc they headcanon them as straight.................the irony. oops I missed this -- nope! I'm not so brave haha ! Just some bs hairstyle with my hair in a ponytail and loose pieces in front . me, being responsible: I'll do some things I have to do instead of swimming but i'll get some air while I do them
me, sweating my ass off on the porch: ...should I go swimming. thank u, i'm gonna go see if the water is buggy yet. Ugh I feel ya bud after a con weekend it’s back to the real world and it’s like whiplash.. I showed my mom Nessa and her response was “She is equivalent in cuteness to Nezuko” . Scary. (softly) I forgot what a pain in the dick it is to mail these plushies compared to keychains and buttons LMFAOO. Hey y’all. I was keeping my screaming on my private account but. Long story short my ex relapsed and now I have to go fucking get him? Maybe take him to the hospital..
I packed most orders but they may be a day or two delayed. Sorry. I wish this wasn’t happening either. Still working things out, about 2.5 hours of sleep so far so packages may not go out til Saturday - which is my normal shipping day but just don’t want anyone to get nervous since I sent some tracking numbers last night. Zzzz goodnight. Bitch I tried . I tried to call my friend out sick since he relapsed and they wrote back “you cannot call out today” which I didn’t even know was a response option so anyway capitalism am I right. Ahdhdhdh I would’ve if shit didn’t just hit the fan over here   hope you find someone to hang! Lrt now THATS the content I was looking for. my mom and cade were sleeping
wish that were me
got most of my orders done tho!...most,. i'm about two seconds from  s n a p p i  n g. you ever try to coordinate the safety of your friend with nine people in two states and two countries because i'm about to lose it. It's a shitshow that no one involved deserves to be dealing with but I'm doing my best \o/. haven't received a call or text in 10 minutes so idk if that's good or bad at this point. youtube is playing really relevant songs i feel attacked. Dunno how I’m still awake but I actually did some pretty good sketches? But since I just lost a couple days idk that I’ll have time to make into merch. You could pin it through a ring on a chain? I’m really tired but I think that’s a thing that may work. Manus love pulling that shit :( I mean you can still make $ from discounting the misprints but like ..the manu still made the error you shouldn’t have to put more out. Braver than the US marines. Well. Even at the sober house he’s calling his friends about a “package.” Low even for him. told him I needed a break. Idk when he’ll be able to read it since he shouldn’t have his phone, but even if I’ve had time to simmer down at least he’ll know how I felt in that moment. I’m glad!! but also I feel like five months from now someone will scroll all the way down and find it and you’ll wake up like “wtf just happened”...though I sincerely hope not . Hnn I hope the fandom stays chill for ya friend ... BNHA is a nightmare — and that’s not even just on this topic, it’s just a general statement. Lrt not watching this show, but watching all the fall out on twitter since apparently everyone i follow it watching it. This thread was really interesting. LRT FJDHFBNDOSNGNDNS. I want this to be me   GOOD JOB THO!! Stickers will be here tomorrow!! Much excite. Thank you friend!!! i wanna make a few more things for AX but i hate playing the game where you make stuff until it's too late to get the order in time lmfao. when cons feedback asks about how your sales were it's like..part of you thinks 'oh they care that i make money' and the other part thinks 'if enough people say they do well they'll raise the cost and feel justified'. BNHA season 4 premiering at AX...why the fuck would u do this to me. > post office
> bank (bc I just casually have my anext cash in the house)
> walk (so cady stops nudging me and so I can breathe) 
> AX prep
> maybe also unpack my freaking suitcase from anext
> ???
> profit. Or you could change your icon bg to a color in your oranges ! Saturday 10AM-Noon— I think they just announced it today. Uh this guy is yelling fuck over and over again in the parking lot next to me and cady   I think he’s having car troubles but uh. Jesus ok he left but men are fucking scary I don’t react well to men yelling either cause of my dad and shit yikes. Holy shit Bakugou’s shirt is perfect!!!!! anytime f*rsuitfriday is trending I think it's fruitsbasketfriday lmfao. lrt I found this while deleting files she's a lil wonky but still pretty cute and i'm on a pokémon kick lately (like everyone else). I SERIOUSLY DONT KNOW HOW YOU GOT THEM TO STAND.. Maybe it's easier to hang them and photoshop out the chain after . every time I try to make new business cards I'm reminded that I am not a graphic designer. (chanting) do it, do it, do iit----. any time . you know wat is maybe impractical but would be cute? boob/butt mousepad but with those cute lil bows they put on lingerie sewn onto them. Me: I don’t like this drawing 
Me: ((adds heavy filter))
Me: hm ok. i found a cute no.6 sketch from 2017 ; o;. !!!!! Sneakers and sneaker illustrations are amazing, I’m 1000% behind this.

I love how you’re writing this like one week before summer officially starts . It’s 5̶ ̶o̶’̶c̶l̶o̶c̶k̶  winter somewhere. LMFAOOO I think I’m headed there my friend “do I REALLY /NEED/ a banner?” - me, after fucking around for an hour with no progress. Special Southern Hemisphere release. Unleash your inner Usagi. Lrt drawing her really hit me over the head w the fact that I don’t draw POC enough - my initial was kind of ashy til I pulled up the ref and got some rouge in her life. I tried to be really conscious of it so hopefully I succeeded  y’all can judge/lemme know when I post later. Also ppl in that thread like ALWAYS COLOR DROP..that’s cool if u want but that won’t always work for your palette! having the ref right there or swatching a color drop on top to compare the value are probably decent ideas. Then reconcile that w your lighting/mood. Use your . THANK YOU MIDI!  I appreciate you!! First time this has happened in a year in a half!! :O pic.twitter.com/oZhOf8Oy2w.

She is art pic.twitter.com/0uTeQC5Vgr. your work is just?? so solid??????? it's so admirable!!! just went to search for the song crush by tessa violet and instead accidentally wrote 'crunch' and barely stopped myself before I continued 'tessa thompson'. not even making a con's waitlist is so brutal . aa i'm happy this was well received!! I should really dress nice more often.. crying bc i'm done w this design except i keep changing the bg color.

Maybe I didn’t?? /drops kids off just in case pic.twitter.com/8uwl9wS7db. Did I ghost write this. It’s my first year, mark me down as FRIGHTENED. I want to see this illustrated but I don’t wanna do it. /casually leaves these here  pic.twitter.com/r48z8WEBXA. SHE!!!! All of these are soooo cute   Thank you for taking the time to draw my girl!! Aaa thank you so much for the support!!! I’m glad they arrived to you safely   Crona became my surprise favorite, they need more love!! AHDBDJDJN literally almost tweeted this morning that I wanted to do more collabs but then I remembered that I’m DYING   bc of vaycay+AX ....this sounds so fun tho.. Both good criers but if you want to absolutely bawl your eyes out to an anime film..I Want To Eat Your Pancreas (not what it sounds like, promise!) . Ugh I want clothes from the new lazy oaf collab w the ceramic studio I follow recently..why would they attack me out of nowhere like this. Can’t believe that he hasn’t tried to call me at all..it’s been days so drugs should’ve worn off..Wonder if he’s mad at me for trying to get him clean again or if he knows I’m probably done with his ass like I’ve said the last thousand times.. it’s a mystery. Why won’t the electric company just give residents notice when they’re going to for example trap you in your street so you can’t leave or make loud noises for 3+ hours in the morning. For some reason I wanted to torture myself so I went to the comments section to look around and THIS GUY WENT DEEP pic.twitter.com/QpCYE1tuup. (Grabby hands at the dresses) . MMM tfw you qualify for free shipping until u use a coupon..u bastards.. i'm crying why is this site like this?? it says 37.50, go to page and it still says that, add to cart suddenly it's 45 -- and it changes where it said 37.50 on the page and now it says 45 there too -- then you get to the final checkout page and it's back to 37.50?? literally what. Hi I love y’all @lazyoaf  but your site just about drove me to the brink on insanity today?! pic.twitter.com/GPp7S5uETw. (Also fear not friends I narrowed it down from this, my wallet couldn’t take that big of a hit  ). Me: maybe it’s the 10% coupon?
Math: 45*9 doesn’t equal 37.5 and the final page shows the 10% off discount is applied to the lower number after
Me: ???!?!!? @  l*zy o*f your site gave me a headache pls give me free clothes. Dhdhdhshd THIS COLLAB IS SO GOOD TBH... *.9. PRETTY MUCH. YES!! I never got to do this one but it was so fun to see..I think some people did it lefthanded too which was funny. Lost the tweet to quote RT abt dream projects but:
 Collab w illustration-centric fashion brand (Lolita or streetwear)
 Gallery utilizing VR (Illustrations animate when viewed thru app camera)
  Design mascot/use existing mascots to illustrate badges/schedule/etc for anime con. Yeah! ESP when people don’t have clean sketching styles. pic.twitter.com/q9M86KIlzP. The rate of me receiving 5 nuggets in a 4 piece is like a solid 30% is this a skill I can put on my resume. Yes I had that realization yesterday right before bed . Realization.jpg. Not fruit but theses Desserts in Streets radiate the same energy pic.twitter.com/NEeW98BTR8. Idk what to do..I need a break from my ex who relapsed and I know he didn’t receive my texts since he’s in a place that took his phone, but it’s been like five days and he hasn’t called me using their phone which he’s allowed to do so it just feels really unresolved. His mom gets back the day before I leave and I really don’t need him trying to call me if he’s out then and I’m in Arizona and LA trying to have fun and do business and forget about him. last interaction I had w him was sending him to work upon his insistence once the Xanax wore off +I don’t think he understood then..does he just Know I’m fed up somehow? Or what?The only way he’d be mad is if he’s pouty that I ruined his fun,didn’t let him destroy himself again. Last time this happened he called me from there almost every day so I’m   like I don’t want that but I haven’t been able to talk and tell him I don’t want that so absolutely what is going thru his mind? As usual I’m the one laying awake at night just left at his disposal . Anyway thanks for coming to my ted talk. Whoever proposed this at a meeting was galaxy braining. Me: so is this enough sleep for the night or pic.twitter.com/kUzeR0V5Bq. I decided maybe I’d send him a letter since he doesn’t seem keen on calling any time soon and also I know he won’t let me lead the conversation where I want it. Wish me luck friends. AAAAA THESE LOOK AMAZING. Omg my big bro is cute we’re only four years apart but he’s not a big social media guy and he called me yesterday to ask how to put a poll on his insta story . he also wrote that his garden was   (trying to say it was lit) and I joked that it’s not good if it’s on fire and he didn’t get that I was joking and explained to me LMFAO. Update trying to get info on how to send the letter and his mom said she’d call me at 9 or 1 then did neither. After saying she’d update me dahs ago..Love how I drop everything for them and they can’t give me an update in almost a week. I decided I’m going to get rid of all my underwear that has holes in it. No word yet on the pajama pants. Yeah..she’s away so the 12 hour time difference doesn’t help either. Honestly..like I have a lot of clothing but so few pajama pants that I feel like I can’t get rid of them til I have new ones I like..but that would require..going out and buying new ones. Which it doesn’t seem like I’m doing . I almost posted a photo the other day but i felt too exposed. LMFAOO NOT PARTICULARLY . Here’s the back..the waistband is almost completely disconnected... pic.twitter.com/ydGnQudT5n. LMFAOO you’re welcome . Just know there’s even more holes in front. This would be a good meme - the kind where you replace the middle of the text pic.twitter.com/O5sGOFyoqV. EVERY GODDAMN DAY. Could have a contest but you already won so what’s the point.

Also this wallet holds American money which is ideal for a wallet for an American ... and change!!! No the blue one isn’t long enough for USD I swear . I always had to fold my money. LMFAOO NO id just like the option is all. Half folded half unfolded . Chaotic energy pic.twitter.com/XXrHWefBJJ. Rude. Woah   Love it!! A new ice cream place opened and I don’t feel like Ice cream rn but I kind of need to know if it’s good cause atm no place in a 20 min radius has my seal of approval . She offered me a sample and IT WAS GOOD THEY HAVE PB FLAVOR BASE thats all I can ask for. Deadass may get ice cream for dinner. Fuck it pic.twitter.com/BjFoQ2B09L. It’s fucking right next to wish and legends dude. It just opened !!! The hottest of takes . Me: I really need a hat for Arizona
This hat: “Arizona”
Me: well fuck can’t argue with that pic.twitter.com/klOrMCGE8x. me: better credit score than my mom
also me: never remembers what kind of credit card I have. i always feel personally offended when places i applied to extend their deadlines . SHD DJDJDNDFNFK I put them in the textile recycling pile so everyone can relax. Losing my mind over the same thing rn..I’ve had a couple people tell me they did better at Anime Boston and a few others tell me to bring 2-3 times what I have for AB so I’m just?! pic.twitter.com/6xh0YGzkFv. Right? I think my friend told me my spot was pretty good...but I’ve also had people say if I don’t have a big following or know what’s trendy on the west coast then I’ll crash and burn so . Yeah  I’m D58! It doesn’t look amazing but there’s worse spots. This man on the train is fighting w one of the train people like “why don’t u open more cars” “cause people would spread out too far..” “that’s the whole point!” “What’s the point of having all the cars then” 
He’s trying to get the man next to him to agree now Give it up bro. He ended with “this is why people hate the MBTA” like I’m sorry do you?? Think this woman runs the MBTA??? Clearly you barely ride the train so it doesn’t affect u so ?? Shut up . It’s even more laughable bc there’s lots of open seats right now ..like I easily found a place to sit alone . “Why can’t I have my own train car” - this guy probably. Aaa you too!! I hope we can meet!! Good!! You don’t owe them anything. Trying to get my own brain to get this too!! If I know the organziers/things seem reputable and organized, theme of the book, previews. I would assume fair-good quality of product anyways. If I see one artist I love is in there it’s not enough of a factor but if it’s like 5-10 then it’s more appealing obviously. Fhsbdjdjdh im sorry your going thru it right now friend . DSFGdfhh TT A TT Thank you Citra!! I'm glad she's so popular hehe. I WANNA SEE THEM ALL TOGETHER it's gonna look a m a z i n g. ?!?!
I hate that we’re in this club together ?? (Also had someone falsely accuse us of abuse..bc he wanted our dog..)
It is so upsetting bc of how much you love them! Hope this passes over soon. im so disappointed. 1st time ordering from @lazyoaf  + after technical issues on their site when ordering, I get an email saying they’re actually out of the thing I wanted most, so they refunded it but maybe charged me shipping since taking it off dips me below free ship threshold. I know shit happens, glad I ordered other things at least but I spent so long picking out what to get to get free shipping so if they did charge me I’ll be really frustrated cause I would’ve liked the option to replace it..10% off isn’t really helpful when shippings like $15. Sent! Thanks :). That’s rough, buddy pic.twitter.com/ieRfPNO8YP. AHENFKDMFND I LAUGHED SO LOUDLY DJNDBFNCMD. Follow up bumper sticker “I project my political views onto my pets”

Always question if my merch rep is ok this time of year.. she didnt add a fee or send me the paypal email - she asked how I wanted to pay?  What’s happening. Me, trying to go to bed at 2:37 AM:
My mom: (reminds me California has earthquakes
Me:. Oooh that’s true, my PS set up is tools left navigator, history, layers right..I’m a simple gal LMFAO. guys if i don't finish this no.6 print before AX please kick my ass,, I really wanna finish it. LMFAOO NOOOo DONT REMIND ME#flight anxiety. oof waitlisted for water park con //shakes them down. ahhaha I know what you meant~~ I'm just in denial..BC OF ARIZONA......THREE FLIGHTS TOTAL...
Ahh lucky, lucky~ my first one was early then they changed it to eVEN EARLIER. i'm not a water park person just seems like a fun concept. Eeep!! Yes, I hope you can keep your good timing!!

Nah, my mom also hates flying and "can't handle going up and down more than once" LMFAO so no stop overs, just one to AZ to meet my bro + grand canyon, one to LA, one home. YEAH..bc my bro has a conference in AZ it was good timing@A@.....................WELL, NOT FOR ME BUT--

oof i'm sorry you also experience it;; yeah my most precious stuffed animal goes through it with me..Some pilots land really smoothly and others BONKSDFBNFGD. live your best life. checked a few more things off ax/trip prep list....feeling.......NOT ANY BETTER. Piggybacking on this!! I once received manu photos (of enamel pins) and they looked SO, SO OFF —- and then they arrived and were exactly how I wanted??! So don’t worry just yet!! (Tbh they still look good to me - and the one with the transparent front is the most on brand thing I’ve ever seen!! ). Aaa yeah I figured that was the case!! Someday~~. Ohhh it’s so nice being able to go back and forth! Me: This dog is sooo cute what am I supposed to do?!
Me: Like picture this: I’m at the club, bring a guy home, he sees Cady and goes, “She’s way cuter than you, I have to go”
Mom: Jennie that would never happen
Me: You’re right..I’d never go to a club. Dhdjdjd I flew to a con a year ago and had no trouble but this time a whopping Zero checked bags are included on two of three flights and it’s making life Very Hard. reviewing the A**X packet......I don't understand why you're not allowed to roll a suitcase in when it's...in a parking garage......................?? am i losing it or? . pic.twitter.com/69lveuB3aF. Sndbdhhd but like. Am I gonna have to stop outside and unpack my suitcase and bring things in one at a time?! Literally can’t just carry everything..I’m so perplexed. $3-5, I do $4, 3 for $10. Woke up on the other side of the bed..odd. Me, all week: I’m gonna go swimming on Saturday!
My mom, just now: Jenn, it says thunderstorms, pea-sized hail, and 30 mph winds. Aa thank you! I knew most places meant that but I saw someone say luggage wasn’t ok so then I got really unsure . New biz cards for AX (feat. Cady’s foot) pic.twitter.com/wqmhPXD1Y3.

Make fanny packs. i'm sorry, i had to experience this and now we must all. AU where I sleep more than two hours at a time pic.twitter.com/PZaGzVXMWc. tweeted this before but my shoes have holes in the toes, soles are worn down completely so I slip on any amount of water..after 2 stores+prob 15 pairs of shoes I bought these and they’re the most boring things I’ve ever seen and they’re not comfy as much as they’re not painful pic.twitter.com/LakIWF2zM6. COULDN’T MAKE THIS UP IF I TRIED pic.twitter.com/Ogncqo20oP. @ grimmfirefly  is so fed up w my years of frayed edge table cloths that she’s voluntarily hemming this rn pic.twitter.com/gY4RguVgf3. I need one of those digitally painted hyper realistic interpretations of this. Me: take a photo!!
@grimmfirefly  : fucking this pic.twitter.com/aOVa2ubCmd. My mom got a tiny white noise machine for the couple nights we’re at a hotel and I went through listening to the nine sounds and anyway I’m ready to sleep now. SCREAMING HVVNHF pic.twitter.com/ARHghp0scy. I usually tell them to look around, ask other household members, neighbors, and their local USPS, then check back with me or follow up in a week or so. Sometimes it shows up. Otherwise it says on my site that I’m not responsible for third parties. damaging/losing it, but it happens fairly infrequently so I usually just replace it for them cause I’m weak   Could also ask them to repay shipping (I do when it’s international), offer discount code, or just say it’s out of your hands cause it is. all valid responses. Making merch is such a pain cause sometimes you have to decide whether to compromise your vision or just not make the thing at all   Sometimes it’s limited by what’s possible tech wise, other times by $$$, or high MOQ. My clothes don’t fit and it’s fucking depressing
I’m not so upset that I gained weight as I am that I just really love some of these clothes and now I can’t wear them. Me, packing my HALF A SUITCASE for Grand Canyon/AX: I should bring lightweight pieces which can easily mix and match 
Also me: pic.twitter.com/VMUfVF65KH. Also AX folks - what I’ve gathered is that the artist alley is Hot even when the AC is on ..so I should not bring my hoodie/shorts ? They’re kinda thick material..not terrycloth but similiarish. Oof Ok good to know!! It will save me some room in my suitcase at least   Thank you friend! Hnn im also pretty weak to heat and dehydration. we’re doing the Grand Canyon first where it’s gonna be like 95 so ill either be Completely Dead or somewhat adjusted by the time I get to AX - it’s anyone’s guess. Thank you. been so busy trying to balance life shit, con stuff, and yknow going outside and being a person that I've barely drawn lately u nu I have a few local shows but wanna mostly chill after AX............. IT LOOKS AMAZING THO..ALL THOSE COLORS IN THE WHIP CREAm..amazing. THANK U dying to wear it out but haven't had the opportunity....I nearly wore it to meet you but thought it was a bit much LMFAOO. aa yeah it's not the softest tho so if it's not gonna be for the con i'd rather bring another instead u nu. the key to being comfy on planes is layers bc sometimes it's been crazy warm and others ICE COLD. ROWDY BOYS!!!! When I had tododeku and kiribaku merch I named them soft boys and rowdy boys respectively. I’m sorry that fandom ruined kiribaku for you :( it’s a good pair! I’ve been lucky enough to not get involved in any fandom drama but sometimes it’s hard to avoid..bnha is the first fandom I’ve experienced this with, I understand how it’s impacted your enjoyment . Mm I understand. A lot of artists I follow have moved on from it, probably sick of dealing w the more obnoxious fans   It can be hard to curate your experience when a fandom has a bajillion people yelling a bajillion different things .. Ack!! Yeah esp with how twitter works now showing your replies, likes, etc to other people to your followers... it’s exhausting. Me, halfway through wrapping my charm box: ......is the TSA gonna wanna go through this. Is it obnoxious to leave a note in the suitcase I’m checking like hey this is shit I sell pls be careful thank u bc I’ve read a lot of people getting their con bags back w stuff spilled out everywhere.. Ohh ! Great minds think alike . Lmfao well I guess i May as well try!! Wow that must be nervewracking for people who put hours into handmaking their cosplays.. Omg...that’s one hell of a mental image . it’s my second time! Idk why it seemed way easier to pack the first time?? I think bc I had two suitcases then and I’m going for one and a half (carryon) this time bc none are included . I am also Very Scared. Pls buy my stuff at AX ...like money is cool but mostly I......I really don’t wanna figure out how to repack all this LMFAOO. Ngl I thought about this . My bro likes craft beer so I often end up rolling my clothes around beer bottles in my suitcase for him . Yeah I know the first year it was really bad, I heard it’s better now but still Very Hot and also was told they don’t AC during set up / break down . We’ll find out! . Blaze it. I keep taking breaks from packing to sit next to my dog and just . Suitcase currently: roughly 49 lbs
Things left to pack: roughly 9 lbs
Anxiety: intensifies

...
I have to mail one box still but if I sell enough then I don’t have to mail it back! Update: this suitcase is pretty comfortable to sit on?? pic.twitter.com/e28nVKmYXL. Me: ok that’s pretty much all the con stuff!
My badge and sellers permit: in a drawer somewhere 
Me: ...wait. ...EARLIER TODAY ME WAS WAY TOO AMBITIOUS nooooooo pic.twitter.com/RNRa6fPXvf. I AM ALWAYS SO BAFFLED by all the issues you have w your charm orders?!   I’m sorry stuff like this keeps happening! lrt literally what the fuck. Yeah I agree. Do I love when people resell my fan merch? No, but for all the reasons you said above it’s not like I’m mad at it. I personally feel awkward reselling fan merch from my friends/peers as an artist myself so I have taken to donating it to cons for staff prizes! I hate when a shipping company tells you you have a package coming and you're like absolutely what the fuck is this cause you can't remember ordering anything. me: ugh the hiking boots take up half the suitcase
bro: just wear them on the plane!
me: for siX HOURS?
bro: i always take my shoes off as soon as I sit down
me: oh, so you're /that guy/. agreed. math time! a word problem: 11 hours before we leave for our flight, multiplied by flight anxiety, raised to the AXth power - equals how many hours before i completely breakdown. Hi I suffer from pretty severe flight anxiety and I have!! THREE FLIGHTS TO TAKE! starting tomorrow!(MA>AZ>CA>MA), so please request things for me to draw! Can be characters, pairings, feel free to give expressions/prompts/situations for them -or your OCs or your dog -whatever !! pic.twitter.com/zfrmrOfFpc. Cute as hecc. Who. Sorry in advance for any butchered ocs
Also prob just pen/pencil doodles nothing fancy ! “SORRY FOR THE DEUAY?”   also big mood I’m making my dog walker/house sitter go to the post office.....also left some dishes orz sorry dude. Catch me getting 2.5 hours of sleep and that’s if the anxiety lets me sleep
Goodnight twitter thank you for the requests and well wishes I love y’all. Thank you . Yeah pic.twitter.com/BfjclGksRS. pic.twitter.com/0EPgb9bYQn. TSA next   pray for me and my plethora of keychains. Was doing ok being busy but delayed boarding and I’m . I’m losing my mind they delayed it an hour!! The flight was originally at 9:30, then a couple weeks ago they changed it to 8:30 so I’d get less sleep and now it’s!! DELAYED TO NINE THIRTY IM —. Dunks bagels are so chewy..I want the one from the Jewish deli . Delayed longer..”maintenance” is a good way to scare the fuck out of me. Picked up a lucky penny but then I dropped it and it landed tails so I thought, better to leave it . 2 hours later..they keep saying they’re gonna board in 20 minutes like every 20 minutes pic.twitter.com/VQWrBSg5XS. They just changed it to noon. We were supposed to board at quarter of eight and I’ve had an hour and a half of sleep fuuuuuckkkk!!! NOON NOW. It’s worth noting that we’re driving like six hours after we get in..most w my bro who’s there and well rested but still.. Looking up dimensions online of smth I own instead of going to measure myself is a thing I do. Someone open a capsule hotel at Logan. I wish these free goldfish made up for four hours of my life pic.twitter.com/Hx3wLj57tH. American. Oooh yeah they’re the one w Famous Amos maybe. **4 but now it’ll be rush hour so. 6. Shoutout to @AmericanAir  for delaying our flight every 20 min to an hour for four hours then cancelling it!! People have been waiting in line at the desk for hours. Worst experience. Wish I could tell my past self I wouldn’t be flying for so many more hours maybe I could’ve gotten some sleep . Mute me , I’m not gonna shut up about this sorry. Lmfao sitting here and they announce they oversold another flight. Wow. This whole thing is fucked now all our canyon reservations and shit goddamnit there’s only one with a 4 hour stopover on another airline we’ll pay a fuckton for and I feel so sick I’ve had no sleep. Best of luck friend.. We have Never flown with them before, and never will. Customer service rep refused to change our flight to the 1:00 and then the seats were gone before we could say fuck that and buy them. Just walking through the airport trying to find someone to help us after an employee gave my mom misinformation and had her leave the line. Unbefuckinglievable!! Since I’ve been wandering around literally three different flights they oversold. B y. E. They decided to send my luggage to LA. I’m going to AZ for a week so!!!!!!!! Hahahhaah. Update saved our bags from going to LA, heading to NY but on our flights were not seated together and ones an emergency row lmfao TSA again in a minute. It’s been a day. Mood. New York. Nauseous. Only (checks watch) 6 hours flying and 2 hours driving to go!! Also we’re out a few hundred bucks bc it’s “higher risk” to drive the way we need to at night apparently so we had to book another place last minute . Second flight here we go . Thank you! Yes ok good pic.twitter.com/V8lemVYdkz. Can’t believe the day I’m having. Just arrived in Phoenix, now have to drive two hours. And hey if someone says they need a break from all the stress you bring into their life and want some space to process maybe!! Don’t call and text them!!! Like they explicitly asked!Thanks!!! Big same (thanks friend  ). Mmm orz. In better news Cady got to go to my dog watcher’s friend’s lake house and had a much better day pic.twitter.com/un7zZCwk55.  aaa thank you friend!! I appreciate them. One of our bags is missing. I can’t can’t can’t can’t dndndnfndjdbdb. Found it. Jesus. I don’t think I’ve ever seen this many stars . I don’t even have my glasses on and it’s so beautiful. Sorry for all the negativity today guys thanks for all the positivity!! I drew some doodle requests but the WiFi didn’t work so I couldn’t access a lot of them! I’ll post the ones I did soon and do more on the other flights . Update we pulled over and I put on my glasses and. I can’t even tell you how many stars. And the Big Dipper looks HUGE?! Idk it’s just so open and clear it’s amazing. Finally arrived half an hour ago
For folks playing along at home that was 23 hours of travel!! Should’ve been 8
Goodnight. Lower Antelope Canyon
We missed our upper Canyon tour bc  of yesterday’s mess but this one was the longer and more interesting one to us  pic.twitter.com/pbYSVeiYuM. I keep forgetting AX is in like.’. A few days.

Feel free to keep requesting. Here’s some from insta pic.twitter.com/mxh5XlppS3. Feel kinda like I’m getting sick..I got 1 hour of sleep then was next to a sick person on a six hour flight so that could be it . Horseshoe bend! It was busy since we went at sunset instead of sunrise but so so beautiful pic.twitter.com/vJLXN6XhYg. Promise I’m working on my AX catalogue   not gonna be very cohesive or well organized just ..take it..please . I’m sick   just in time for the grand canyon and AX. YES, YES IT IS. It was a request bc they had a dream about it  
Bonus: pic.twitter.com/NqfqDvdxN2. Thank you!! Trying to sleep and drink water as much as possible! Download my weekly animes for my LA flight . Lrt gymnastics anime would be SOOO GOOD. I love how clean and compact this is!! As someone who is also like that but plans to throw mine together poorly, I really appreciate the effort you went to . Oof this gas station had not only Trump merch but confederate merch   goodbye. Omg it was a hat but similar in ...style .

My mom said there’s a 60-something percent chance our flight to LA will be cancelled..Amer*can Airlines is insane. after the nightmare last week we're just preparing a list of other flights we can try to get on if it's cancelled.. worst case scenario we'll drive but it's like 6 hours sfdgdfhr the delay/cancel statistics are startlingly bad tho... never again.. # AX  Catalogue (1/2)

#animeexpo  #AXartistalley2019 pic.twitter.com/v47YGp1PH4. Didn't know whether to sort by item type or fandom so I did a bit of both!!! HOPEFULLY IT's NOT INCOMPREHENSIBle....my brain has melted in Arizona. pic.twitter.com/ckUolCCJRi. Eggy . Aaa that’s so sweet!   I’m glad you enjoyed it!! I hope i can vend at AAC again this year!

We had a bit of downtime on vacation but I wanted to spend it with my family esp my brother since he’s not home a lot, so I didn’t finish my No. 6 print orz Should be able to finish print catalogue + map tonight, got the minis done on the plane   last minute.. My hair is so faded already   so much for looking hip in LA.. I think it’ll normally last longer if I’m not in the AZ sun every day and washing sand and sweat out of my hair every few days. Wheeze taxi driver seems nice but we really can’t understand each other  so we’ll see ! . Gosh yeah ok pls buy from me I have so much stuff in LA . Probably should’ve asked earlier but any good food/dessert/shopping/cool sight recommendations near the convention center or echo park area..HMU . Ashdjdndlf well it was like 90-100+ where we were in Arizona and everyone says “oh dry heat is better” and like yeah kind of except you get chapped lips and your skin is just like paper   it even feels weird just rubbing your fingers together..LA is surprisingly cool. I hope you can cool down soon!!! Stay hydrated! Back to grab the bags, then to set up we go! . It’s day 0 and things went smoothly so far but Im already wiped out from hiking/driving/flying etc all over the place. I left my mom unattended in target and she bought a small canvas and painted it bc I had nothing to display my enamel pins on and no table space  pic.twitter.com/hOOPv5kVfk. Idk if there’s ever been a bigger mood.

Fuck y’all stress and sleep deprivation Got Me my nose won’t stop running I’m gonna lose my mind. I’m saying screw everything and going to bed cause at this point I am mouth breathing and cannot function. Be gentle w me tomorrow if I’m slow, or missing stuff I didn’t get to prepare, or if my mom’s helping you while I blow my nose in the bathroom. She’s truly something . [magically thanks you  ].

Only ran by earlier but didn’t see. Yeah I felt weird for a while after too   feel better! I want to buy so much bc I’ve never encountered a lot of west coast artists !! SAME . I did an errand for a friend and I wanted like $60 worth of stuff there   can’t commit yet tho.. Too busy to take a whole photo but here’s some sections of my booth!!

There’s a huge clump in front of your table every time I peek! I will eventually make it there . It was $12 each so $24! I love her   I saw a cosplayer! Omg..one...did y’all want..a second set ?  they’re near so..! Sure! Lmfaoo no worries! I didn’t get two sets so if your friends getting them that’s great but if not lemme know and I’ll get them! No! :( they walked by on the other side and I yelled Amu but they didn’t hear. It was one of my first too!! A soft spot for it.  they may as well go to a good home. I’ve done this before 100% and always appreciate it so much when people give ME their art as a gift, but when I wanna give my art as a gift to someone I admire I’m always like “do they even want this? Is this pretentious?”. Can you believe I have a cold and now my period on the first day of the biggest con in the country..curse this fleshy prison. Bank twitter how much of a bill has to be missing for it to be invalid pic.twitter.com/E487Fb2CZT. YEAH IDK I accepted it without realizing bc I’m half here apparently . ALSO IM COMING BY TODAY OR TOMORROW FOR THINGS. Classic artist alley. IVE ONLY GIVEN AWAY TWO please help ...also omg u can tell when I started feeling worse they started getting more crooked  pic.twitter.com/2fJ8bjzuQg. Aa that’s good to know!! Ahahah yeah I accepted it without realizing..and just now I have it as change without realizing before it was in his hands....  best of luck my dude. The earth is quaking but at least it’s cool in here! Still know a lot of artists who waited in an hour line at a different entrance tho. Yes!! Amu and ichigo :). The only possible conclusion. They went for it . Yep! Picked up takeout, gonna eat and sleep!! ALSO I SAW YOUR TABLE AFTER CLOSING hope today went well! me: I want to get over this cold more quickly, I'm going to pick up food, go straight back and rest!
the calendar: bitch u thought. it was cool seeing the fireworks happening all over the skyline!! I sat and watched for a while but uhh they've been going since before it was even sunset and i'm....want slepp. DSAFSRGDHFH DANI!!!!!!
She is so PRECIOUS in your style!!   I love how colorful and sparkly they all look together too!

Yeah!! pretty good, esp for the first of four days! ready to do it again tomorrow LMFAO. (gazes into the distance)
we may never know. the people across the street have been setting them off it's easily the best view but uh they have set one or two off every 5-20 minutes for (checks non-existent watch) over three hours .... Part 2 of 2! Nothing fancy and late as heck but here are (most of) my prints!

It’s almost midnight pls stop fireworking, neighbor directly behind the bedrooms   YOURS HVENT EVEN BEEN GOOD LOOKING damn..they’re the last people. I’ve been away and therefore not online as much and checking TINF but my god was reading the last like four pages rewarding as hell. I’ve seen a million people w that print today   glad it’s going well!! It’s that time of the month where I have to ration my lack of pain bc of 8 hour lasting pills that I can only take twice in 24 hours . Huge shoutout to anyone who introduced themselves to me yesterday and I just smiled and nodded bc my brain doesn’t work!! YOURE IMPORTANT AND IM SORRY. Also I’m kind of a dumbass I’ll trade merch or money for some 6 mm-ish silver color jump rings!!! Idk how many maybe like 20-50 for now  #ax  #animeexpo. This is a horrifying concept. Just imagine having a hamster and a guinea pig and you leave the room and come back to THIS. # ax  #animeexpo  artists!! May open 10-15 min early bc people in hall is fire hazard. Hello if my eyes start watering pls know that I’m ok I’m just holding back a sneeze. Virtual table tour!! #animeexpo  #ax  #AXArtistAlley2019 pic.twitter.com/FIoUyO1QTN. “That’s a little gay” - presumably straight male at my table.

Please bring me sticky notes my crops are dying #animeexpo  #ax  #ax2019  #animeexpo2019 pic.twitter.com/NGjcuOL2qm. Between vacation and con I am like??? Where am I?? What time of day is it?? What day of the week is it? What month is it—-. Oh . My . God . I..want to preface this by saying I love my customers and thank you for the laughs but -

I thought I had heard every version of Eiji -
“Eiji”
“Edgy”
“A.J.”
Now
Get ready for:
E L I. SHDBDHDNDJ ANDY HOW LONG DID U SPEND ON THIS CAUSE ITS PURE GOLD!!! I LAUGHED SO LOSULY DJDNFNC. Today is almost done! Here’s my prediction for what won’t last the day tomorrow! I’ll try to update as I get low on things but I’m guessing it’ll be pretty hectic  #ax  #animeexpo  #animeexpo2019  #ax2019  #animeexpoartistalley2019 pic.twitter.com/fBkqURggHY. Shoutout to everyone not at AX who has been dealing with all of my tweeting - it’s so hard to move in here that advertising on social media is important so I appreciate y’all coming along for the ride. Oof the number of times I’ve relied on a hotel desk for con change is Many. I think only once have they gave me trouble but in general a good plan!! @ CA CAN U STOP HAVING EARTHQUAKES I’m gonna Panic. Feeling good about restaurant choice not bc of the food but bc of the inset lighting. Actual event at the table next to me

Waitress: are you ready to order?
Guy: is that an earthquake?? Do you feel that?
Waitress: Oh, yesterday?
Guy: no, like RIGHT NOW
Guy: (looks at me for validation)
Me: (nods aggressively). A little shakey (pun not intended) but fine!! Idk why I wasn’t upset last time but this time was like JDNDKEKDN
Thank you for the concern tho. It’s Lit. That person didn’t stop shooting off fireworks until 2 AM last night and now it’s almost 11 ON THE FIFTH OF JULY and they just started again pls I’m tired. Seriously ..last night was rude to go that late but tonight is just like what are you doing my dude. Aaa thank you for letting me thank you for keeping all us banana fishers well-fed with your content   I’m so glad I was able to grab stuff before it sold out - I hope the rest of the con treats you well!! You thought heat exhaustion was bad? Get ready for MULTIPLE EARTHQUAKES. HARD PASS, THANKS. Uh I made the mistake of reading about earthquakes and idk how much sleep I’ll get tonight. Anyway I haven’t been in CA until now so we can’t rule out that my presence alone is causing the earthquakes. Fell asleep after turning off my alarm but only for 6 mins dhdbdn. I’m usually late on Sunday’s but since this con is four days today is That Day butnillntry to move faster fkdnfj fatigue setting in and still a bit sick. If you’re looking for an evaluation of how on my game I am today I’m letting you know that I sat down too far to one side and almost fell off the toilet then spit onto my own arm while brushing my teeth thank you. Ok apparently can’t go in the door I’ve gone in the past two days all of a sudden so fuck me I guess. Made it! I’d say AX and Ota compete for most disorganized con. Please come by my table and tell me about the BNHA premiere. It’s been so slow? I think everyone’s hung over, in line, at the BNHA premiere, or still getting in their most intense cosplay of the weekend . Omg what?! Does that happen to people ?! “We open whenever and no, you can’t come in”. Only two kyos left!!! I ordered more of him than the others and yet here we are  pic.twitter.com/CoB9XGBr8Z. I’m crying why have three people paid with hundreds today . Haha I don’t mind the occasional one but three in a row was rough, had to ask friends for help . Aaa if anyone knows who the artist with Banana fish charms at AX is - I don’t have a photo but the person said they have an ash Eiji one but also a yut-lung and sing charm too! #AX  #ANImeexpo. I’m so surprised and happy that the bandanas have been so popular! I only have a few misprinted ones left. I’m excited to use a little chunk of my AX money to get a bigger screen so I can print them with less hiccups sometime!! Not sure if it’s the same cosplayers as the other day or not but I got a pic!! pic.twitter.com/oRIRCoCfYC. Suddenly I wanna draw Shugo chara . If anyone needs $1 bills for change I will deliver bc I am OVERWHELMED with them   #ax  #animeexpo. UM SINCE WHEN AND ALSO NO. Kiri has been well-fed today  pic.twitter.com/4vi3BaE3VI. I was going to do a sale at the end of the dimmer w overstock but now I have a couple fall cons so . Today really did fly by!! Also omg poor Kermit being sacrificed. Other things I’m low on:

Buttons: Fruits Basket, Eiji (thank you CA for keeping them together but normally Ash is more popular!!), Ichigo

Acrylics: NO.6, big 3 pin

Prints: Miraculous, Oofuri 

And bandanas! OH SHIT DO U WANT THEM NOW. I decided to go out tonight since I don’t have much time to explore but I’m,,,, exhausted and still waiting on dinner   y’all have so much stamina!!! Tomorrow is the last day!! Be sure to come early because we close at 3:00!!! Please help me empty more space in my suitcases bc I...shopped https:// twitter.com/cambrasine/sta tus/1145826083251486721   …. Thank you so much for stopping by and supporting us!! Aaa I just hit the goal I made in my head for AX sales and it feels good!! I spent sooo much to be here (flights, dog sitting, Airbnb, SO MUCH STOCK, etc) so I can’t say I made a huge profit by any means but I feel kind of accomplished still!! 100% of the time. GOOD!!!! I’m glad to hear it’s going well for ya!! Also I’ve seen u several times and haven’t seen Haruka yet tell her hi . I’m leaving CA immediately. Shshshsh im so sorry you had bad experiences!! The staff here is....... . I’ll just say it’s certainly been a time.. I hope the rest of the weekend serves you nothing but good vibes . AX staff is wild. This guy this morning was like shocked that I thought I could just walk in without going bag check like I did the last THREE days and it’s like dude that’s on you guys for not checking before and being inconsistent af don’t get mad at me?! Every day my body begs me more and more to please just stay in bed 
and break down is today too ....... 10 but maybe earlier if people in hall is fire hazard. I am coming for this cutie  pic.twitter.com/2lTjqvBvLc. It’s a selling the top-most display copy kind of day. OH DAMN I didn’t bring money on this bathroom run I’ll get it on the next one . Last day!!! Help me not go over the weight limit at the airport!!!!  https:// twitter.com/cambrasine/sta tus/1146878899147558912   …. Just two hours left!!!! 
Last two Victuuri and Miraculous posters, last ichigo heart button, etc. so come soon!! Anyway I’m never buying anything ever again Ohmygod. Omg the world is small.. I haven’t even Tried to go to dealers but I hope y’all are doin ok. Stupid shit I’ve heard walking around in the AA today
“Can I hang out back there (behind your table)? I’m hot”
“So this is the original? And it’s $300?!”
“I can’t believe they wouldn’t let us in early to look around”. Yes please!! aaa thank u!! I didn’t really have time to count stock and I need more buttons and crap too so I think I’m just gonna wait and order later orz. There was no place to tap...trapped eternally. Y’all taking haul photos how the heck do u have em the enfngjefngbenergy. My least favorite thing about CA (if we just go ahead and pretend earthquakes aren’t a thing) is how impossible it is to find a regular ice cream place! Every place is soft serve, gelato, froyo, etc :( And no Baskin R*bbins and C*ldstone don’t count cause we have that at home. On a more serious note I’d really like to say THANK YOU for AX! Buckle up, cause this is a long one! 

While the organization leaves much to be desired and cons in general are tiring, I overall had a really lovely time. If you’ve been following me then you’ll know just how many. stress tweets I made leading up to it, but the last couple days especially I genuinely just felt really happy and had fun vending! There were times I spaced out but other times I would realize I was just sitting there smiling or when I wanted to stop assembling charms and was. eager to get back to interacting with y’all. I got to meet lots of new attendees and artists on this coast too, which is always exciting! So thank you to everyone who came by - to those who supported me and made this my highest sales con ever when you had so many amazing artists. to choose from, to my followers (who both were + weren’t@AX) who survived all my tweeting both before, during and now after the con-and especially to my AA friends who answered my questions and helped me better prepare for this weekend!  I appreciate you all, and goodnight! . I don’t do tea :(. I’m feeling so mushy rn between the relief of AX being over and seeing my good friend for the first time in like a year hdhdhdhd . AX + Little Tokyo Haul 
part 1 of..many pic.twitter.com/HxhryKL8Tq. Right?? It was really cute and unexpected!! The company is Oriental Berry Inc and I got it at the Kinokuniya here. Think I lost a little weight on vacation so now this swim suit is too big and I left my favorite one at the Airbnb :(. Wow!! Ya can’t really swim here huh!!   I had fun getting tripped and pummeled by waves tho!!  Nice to be in the sun after 5 days inside!! pic.twitter.com/lf72B7rVyc. Galleries in Laguna pic.twitter.com/6k8G1SQn94. Literally what is happening to you I’m so sorry. Heya!! So I know there’s like two different AX sign ups - is there a certain number of tables slotted for each or how does it work? Sorry if it’s in my face somewhere but I wasn’t able to find the info. MA: two to three lanes, left is fast, right is slow
CA: six lanes, all fast. I have come to the conclusion that the highways here are worse than any part of NY. Our driver is deadass driving w his phone in his hand on this same insane highway . I hope you survived this. Yeah... we had someone flash their lights at us bc we slowed down bc an oil tanker swerved into our lane . ITS REALLY BAd.. and they drive so fast then slam on the brakes like damn just ?? Drive slower??
We had not one but two different single men in trucks in the carpool lane driving up our butt at 80 mph. I LITERALLY SAW A GROUP OF LIKE FIVE DUDES BIKING DOWN A MAJOR ROAD TONIGHT AND ONE WAS SITTING ON HIS BIKE BAckwards AND ANOTHER WAS SITTING CORRECTLY BUT PEDDLING/MOVING BACKWARDS.. I’m flying again tomorrow 
I am scareb . Flying again today! Go for it https:// twitter.com/cambrasine/sta tus/1144024715746582530   …. You’re the strongest. A lady dropped her bag on me on the escalator but otherwise going smoothly   it’s bizarrely quiet here??? Like traffic was insane but there was no line to drop bags and thru TSA in probably 15 mins.. Pros of going home: 
  MY DOOOGGGG AND BUNBUN
  Swimming in the pond
  Spider-Man?????
  Breathe for 5 mins?? Make art?
Cons of going home: 
 All the problems I’m returning to . scREAM !!! pic.twitter.com/rR1Pl6dI2e. ANDNDJDNDNS AAA SHES SO FREQKING CUTEEE. I love how she looks in your style, thank you soooo much!! 
Can I put it on my ref page with credit?? I usually get painful stomach aches but this time I’m nauseous shdbdhdh send no-turbulence vibes. No . Eep too late now but yeah that’s a good idea. Good news there’s a kid kicking my seat on a 6 hour flight. Landed!! Also our pilot sounds half asleep . Also it was funny it was pretty easy to identify people from AX on my flight - I’m wearing omocat, another person was wearing meyoco, another had dozens of enamel pins on their bag . They moved our baggage carousel, snack time pic.twitter.com/13uI6h3EVw. OOF I think one set was broken or smth cause none of the ones there were moving and the guy kept aggressively pressing the button lmfaoo. SNNDJDND THE ABSOLUTE STRENGTH how do people fly in anything that’s not sweatpants. After a weekend cady is ecstatic to see us - after three weeks that one time she refused to look at us - so I’m curious to see what happens tonight. Literally what is this 100% sure I did not order pic.twitter.com/VDH0971che. Anyone else get a giant sample packet out of nowhere. I think they just decided I’ve given them so much of my $ over the years that they could get more if they sent me new stuff . The water bottle is pretty nice actually. Walk into my room for the first time in two weeks and pic.twitter.com/rG7bRmJCKi. I ordered two things from the same company in the same size and one barely fits and the other is huge..l*zy o*f disappointed me so hard thru this whole process :(. We kinda match pic.twitter.com/RIZVJ61o2Z. AHAHDH AND THATS REALLY SAYING SMTH considering what a feat it is to move around in there  I’m glad we could meet even briefly and thank you again for the super cute stickers   I had a great time and def made back the $ I put out and then some. I bought things for five friends and idk where any of them are   best of luck y’all ———- LMFAOO NO SORRY ILL FIND THEM TOMORROW PROBABLY. Big shoutout to myself for remembering @ginkohs  was gonna be at AX before they sold out of things  
Ps sorry this was a nice post til the last photo pic.twitter.com/bDg9QVukZ8. Ouch. Yeah I noticed it’s more expensive lately .. AU where I own a four color press. Shdbdhdh fuck . I sleep so well on vacation then the second I get home it’s back to restless nightmares. Find someone who loves you like I love Kirishima Eijirou. I was on a good schedule for those two weeks but it’s three hours later here so it completely undoes it lmfaoo. (checks wrist) time to do inventory. if you can identify the song that begins around 2:00 I will give you my undying gratitude.. https://www. youtube.com/watch?v=WI0a6x X-fKA   …. She is so beauty pic.twitter.com/fRcBShA5d2. Missed the guy who watches Cady cause we were out on a walk but caught him driving out and Cady put her paws up on the car and kissed his dogs face and it was ADORABLE. Lrt a counterfeit...$20..... found the rest of the stuff for friends from AX!! @spittinglizards  @vicunad  @egoisticartist  @grimmfirefly  \o/ I send/give soon. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,wait am i ...forgetting someone. @ Flowerrwolf  SDGRDTFH SORRY i haven't found him yet. it was five i didnt find one of the items yet;;;. More AX + Little Tokyo Haul!! Feel free to ask for artists since some couldn’t be tagged/aren’t on twitter/etc pic.twitter.com/K0Rw9PqqHQ. It’s @ginkohs    I missed their asheiji zine a little while ago so I was so happy to grab this and a poster. Aa yeah I either got it Friday or early Saturday but I think it did sell out   glad you got the poster too tho, it’s sooo gorgeous . Aggressively mistags post I’m so sorry. Pouch is @wwileyy  and button may be @elvisclt  unless they were sharing or I got the table#wrong . Oh shit I saw someone wearing one of those...I wonder. Oh no. IS THAT THE THING IDK ITS FROM MY NEIGHBOR I thought it looked cool !! AAa thank you! I didn’t think it looked like your work but I was at a loss haha. It’s gonna be hot forever..I could swim,,, every day. eeep!! I actually..don't think I got their card/name?! there were  a few people there.. I used twitter search to find -- @Nahtanddo  @BottomiestDylan  can u help ? ; u;. thank u for recognizing her beauty
i love seeing pics of your pup too!! I figured!! it was unexpected though haha  I didn't even know they had all that stuff until I happened upon their twitter a few weeks ago  .. I feel like no one will buy a puzzle tho;;. i ate too much food
and also
too much cake. lrt AA I should keep reading this now that i'm not con crunchin'!!! I started on a whim one day. lrt seven year old Jennie bawled her eyes out when her petpets ran away, I think my mom may have even written to support. i looked at my computer clock and it says 6:48 and I thought "that's late" then I looked to the side and the clock on the oven says 9:48 and i went "fuck"
I'm gonna
fix that. aaa at AX I sold all my remaining bandanas (even misprints) and more  of my original charms, enamel pins, and sticker sheets than usual! I love yelling about fandoms but it feels good to sell original stuff too u vu. manus giving more merch than you order is cool but also if you don't count how much you actually receive u end up w ridiculous numbers,
for example I have 18 unaccounted for mini prints that I sold and like I remember handing several people a print I supposedly sold 0 of. sfdgdh THANK YOU!! I'm so glad you like it!!

Also I'm p sure I told everyone but just in case - if it's the 22" be sure to iron it 3 mins each side before washing for the first time! (Sorry my airbnb was supposed to have an iron but it did Not!!). me: I really can't buy a switch just to play the new pokémon game...
nintendo: switch lite
me: (sweating). was talking to manus about new products then low-key disappeared for two weeks and now i prob have 1000 messages. if I could not care about strap color this could cost half as much to produce but u know i care A Lot adfgdhgh. oh no!! i'll dm you! me: are you sleeping
@grimmfirefly  : no
me: (sends long paragraphs of a problem that's too complex for me to figure out and definitely too complex for someone trying to sleep to figure out). my mom specifically told my dog watcher to just put the linens in the washer and not run it and anyway you can guess what happened
end result is a lot of now-gray previously-white-and-light-pink towels. I thought she was crazy for hiding the good (newer) towels but..she is genius. Did I ghost write this. Where can I purchase “how to relax for dummies”. Ok did inventory today and half unpacked, tomorrow I will start if not finish unpacking + packages. gonna bite the bullet and get a sample from the most expensive manu cause they're the only ones willing to customize the way I want TT A TT. manu: 100 pieces is too small.. but we could make 20-30 as a sample
me: ???????????????????????????????? TWO THINGS..this is about water bottles .... I wanted to do transparent ones but I may cave and do the metal ones bc this is Impossible
the other post is about fanny packs  ; o; ... I want a cute one LMFAOO. Aa me too!!.... but in the end everyone just wants keychains . LMFAOOO MYSELF TOO THO shdbdjd I’ve been trying to be better about restraining myself. I got lost reading neopets lore last night and now I wanna draw neopets. I sketched out designs for a neopets sticker sheet in a past sketchbook...wonder which one.. The ice cream shop employee and I could not come to an understanding. Me: that’s a PB base right 
Employee: no it’s vanilla
Me: isn’t it PB tho
Employee: well it’s vanilla mixed with a lot of PB
me, internally: so it’s PB.. No, just a peanut butter enthusiast   They have two different PB flavors so I was trying to confirm it was the right one but she kept insisting it was just vanilla. Thank u for the validation twitter. P*shmark is such a nightmare I just signed up and listed like two things and it’s like BITCH U FOLLOW 150 PEOPLE like what is going on w this app. fsdgsdh lewd things keep popping up on my TL today  
 I see why people have NSFW accounts. Thursday is now music anime day!!! ok i'm sorry but how high were the writers on Party Crasher (Miraculous) 
literally what did i just watch. ah I see people saying there are clearly episodes which come before it and the station is airing it in whatever order they wish as usual which makes sense bc they just glanced right over two major things like 'yeah u guys know this already no worries'. [Miraculous spoilers???? the pic I'm referencing has been out for so long]

the real question is where is mouse!marinette episode her hair is so cute I wanna see it. Cady looks like she lost a fight but really she just licked her arm pit until it was bright red   how did the dog watcher not notice, it looked so ouch!! pic.twitter.com/eJlHoOtlwn. eeep!! I downloaded but didn't watch it yet!! I'm excited!! ONE MINUTE FIFTEEN SECONDS INTO GIVEN AND MY MOM GOES "wait...so what happened"
jesus lady WATCH THE DAMN SHOOOWWWW.  aaa I totally feel this! And sometimes it’s still hard to identify the artist bc not everyone keeps up with their online accounts or sometimes it’ll be a whole table of one persons work except for one board which is their friends, etc . Mmmmmmmmmm
Bear. It is open to interpretation. aa I hope the sample comes out cute so I can show y'all /rolls around
now is..the waITING. im drawing neopets and honestly it's really fun just dont ask me to draw half of them. Love having to call the government to ask if my school can really not accept $4k in financial aid that I qualify and met the deadline for bc they arbitrarily decided that they wanted it by the last day of class??? gov said apply by this date for $ for the 18-19 year, so we did. and now my school says since class ended in May they don’t wanna process it Even tho the government deadline was in June?? I’m not asking u fuckers for money just take it from the government cause I don’t have it. She’s gonna escalate the case ..10 to 20 business days before I find out if I need to come up w 4k to return to school in fall .. This is why my school has a 56% graduation rate . Yeah...slash like don’t make random arbitrary deadlines that are posted absolutely nowhere?? Like they could just..take the money from the grant I got...but they?? Won’t??? What’s even more confusing is they just GAVE ME two other federal grants without me having submitted ANYTHING which wasn’t right, yet now that I actually applied for them all they don’t wanna let me use the third one?? Shipped out all orders today, except for the couple with matsuri charms bc I ran out of fancy straps!! Should arrive in the next few days! trying to get some collaborators for this too   .....i hope people are interested after all this LMFAO. This is usually what I say . aaa i already watched this weeks anime so I started Good Omens so I know what the Cool Kids are talking about. me: wow so many projects I can get back to now that i'm free
my brain: neopets !!! STICKERS!!! N O W !!!! the only answer is that they want to make my life as difficult as possible??

not to mention the time they literally kicked me out for dropping too many classes (even tho I told them I was attending half time?!) and i had to write them a fucking appeal letter. aaa so much good stuff! 
PS Cleffa and the wave girl are mine too~   Thank you so much for your support!! ahaha no worries - just letting ya know! I got less than this and I had a hard time trying to track everyone down too so I totally get it ! OH AND THANKYOU!!<3. preview ;) 
don't rt obviously, i cropped it hard on purpose lmfao pic.twitter.com/boFUb2mqDw. My level of organization is having not one, two, nor three but FOUR empty toothpaste tubes in my drawer pic.twitter.com/nfONWFeJvJ. Good luck!! Oh good, that box will be perfect storage for even more empty tubes. I still don’t really know what artfight is but I will support you. Lmfaoo I feel like the only one that’s completely unmanageable is a drum set like hELL NO. HES SO PRETTY. Cady has been cuddling sooo much since we got home   every time she’s sleeping on the couch and I’m sitting shell scootch closer and closer until her head is against my leg it’s super cuuuute!! AX is known for totally nailing it this is 200% on brand. LRT I’m weak for kiribaku so I ended up buying those books instead but I got to see this at AX and it was full of gorgeous artwork!! Noooooooooo :(. Bunny suits are peak cuteness, change my mind. This is also very valid 
I like with bunny ears tho when one is up and the other is flopped over I think it’s super cute . ENDBDUD IM SORRY THATS THE WORST. Lrt this whole thing is absurd pls go support the artists there then give the organization a piece of your mind. As usual may ignore the results but curious abt preferences for neopets stickers. my mom to the dishwasher: are you still going over there? I thought you finished?
me: thAT'S W h AT ShE SAiD. i'm sorry this poll was pointless bc i think i can fit them all on one 5x7 LMFAO..thank you for trying to help me tho I appreciate u (and its good to know for future things). THIS REMINDS ME I NEED TO SEND YOUR STUFF. I could've done a theme like baby neopets or fairy neopets but instead I just went for a more classic look, lots of primary+secondary colors, etc. a couple of items,
IS THERE ANYTHING YOU'D LIKE TO SEE IF I HAVE ROOM..................
I tried to draw jelly but it was impossible. I have a lil nova on there!! 
UGH I’ve been wrestling w myself about including a Chia  pic.twitter.com/N2yH9XEnXI. Ohmygod they demolished the bathroom in December and my mom finally bought mirrors so I can see what i goddamn look like. Haha they feel sort of important tho.. I think the problem is like there’s so many different pets that I hope I chose a good selection  I kinda just did whatever I wanted tho haha 
I hope you’ll like it!! (Softly) I chose simple shape ones w no structure . oof gonna repost the quality was abysmal?! Guess who fell down a virtual pet lore rabbit hole the other day and came out with this sticker sheet?  Preorder@ http:// cambrasine.art/shop-all     or I'll have it at future cons!

  Remember to use the code FLATSHIP on orders of *only* prints + stickers for free shipping!  pic.twitter.com/g6Q6HDbmnU. Ok it’s still bad idk whatever. Me: her email address was about BTS
@grimmfirefly , completely serious: what’s BTS? I heard it was a dumpster fire this year and when I told someone who went that my friend from NY was gonna do it bc they were local they were like ITS SO BAD THEY STILL SHOULDNT DO IT. Lrt you can just say cool thanks if ya want but yelling is good too   I’m not always good at showing my excitement IRL so I feel ya either way. Close but not quite . My super religious trump supporting mom’s birth mom just fb friend requested me...bruh u don’t wanna do that . I really love
Dalmatians. THESE ARE SO PRECIOUS I’ve been quietly oohing and ahhing when you’ve posted them. Lrt I 100% did this at AX. Aaaa I’m so glad things fell into place for you this year!!  I hope you’re having a lovely day~~. I haven’t had a manicure since PROM  pic.twitter.com/NtEo8FxsDL. Yeah!! I always default to regular French so this was fun! Aa thank you . Thank you!! I’m digging it too! HESNJDSNJDDBS I SAW SPIDER-MAN. Patterned button down collection - small but growing!! pic.twitter.com/Jx1LKXlrMu. Left to right @UchuuSummer , Marshall’s courtesy of @grimmfirefly  , vintage/thrifted. OHHH!! Lrt pls support them!!! I really want to see what they create . pic.twitter.com/1XCvkUP7Vy. rip corgi. Last time I painted my nails myself I cried. How do some people do this witchcraft?? I hope you were able to save your manicure . Lrt pour one out for every sorry SOB that thought that  
It’s so funny how like 80% of fan art for BF is fun and tropical . Shflfndnc Ohmygod. I thought AB was the most insane until I went to ota who the fuck is shopping at 11 pm. DHDBSISNS HOLY SHIT THts PRETTY IMPORTANT Dnfnfj I haven’t started the manga yet but..thank u for making me aware..... lmfaoo I appreciate them confirming the size of the pattern w me but also they just deadass sent me a rectangle and i'm like uh could i have the actual size so I can look at it and tell bc this is nothing. Aaaa Happy anniversary!! . My school sent me a letter saying they’re gonna send it to a debt collection agency even tho it’s being investigated rn ..and again the government will literally give them the money if they would just TAKE IT. That’s so inconvenient. HDBDJDNKSDN OHmygod. Yeah why is this a theme lately. it's a heated pillow !! i think it's got some herbs and stuff in it too.. I wanna try the sinus one sometime  https://www. motherearthpillows.com /  . you ever just living your life, minding your business on twitter and some account feels the need to show you the penis of an obscure animal. Today’s the day I actually look up what the fuck art fight is, halfway through the month. VERY LATE BUT hope it went well! Oh really! I thought it was August 1st but again I know nothing so I’m gonna go read haha. Me before my post-AX massage: angry crying abt my school 
Me post-massage: nothing even matters (in a good way). OH NOO   I’m sorry to hear that but like you said you never know! Sometimes you think you did poorly then you get it, sometimes you think you nailed it and don’t get a call back so only time will tell!! Full tummies and relaxed brains and muscles make such a difference! I just wore denim two days in a row 
Who am I. spent so long uploading my characters to art fight that I lost my motivation to draw LMFAOO. also i'm on team nightmare apparently which feels really off-vibe for my art but also everyone i've seen is on that team so uhh let's go lesbians?? I feel like everyone I know is this team which is...cool but also..now i can't draw your kids????? Aaa thank you for the support!! Ps good taste in OTPs . Your phone...the camera must be on . Electric company: we’re gonna work on your street (again) this week

Feel like I should draw her gf to match bc that’ll be the first finished color ref of her too oops . A summary of what I’m currently dealing with pic.twitter.com/zA8S7ZYiyM.

I just backed Lucky Pocket Press - Artist Collective and Risograph Press! on @Kickstarter https://www. kickstarter.com/projects/lucky pocketpress/lucky-pocket-press-artist-collective-and-risograph-press?ref=thanks-tweet   …. “Are you sure? I don’t wanna lose it towards the house..”
“Yeah, yeah”
A conversation I just heard from electric workers that inspired much confidence pic.twitter.com/7708mcMvSK. They also gave less than 24 hours notice (previously gave NO notice), told to park cars somewhere else if we needed to go out but now I literally can’t even walk down the street so ??? 
Also using my neighbors driveway for lumber w/o permission, parked on  our lawn, etc. I thought if I can’t walk down the street at least I can kayak but the dock is right in front of that house so now I’m like MMMMMMMM. Oi they’re doing the one next to my house now, pray this isn’t my last tweet LMFAOO. lmfao artfight is amazing cause people are like THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ATTACKING ME!! <3 <3 <3. also I was trying to find a file and I was like 'didn't i name it lesbians or smth' but couldn't find it that way, so I searched by date and pic.twitter.com/VVuKwL31ME. Also here's another #artfight2019  I did last night but I got less and less sure as time went on   The creator @Barnielz drew a really cute drawing of my Marceau so I was intimidated LMFAOO pic.twitter.com/qlVSiNmgeI. Here’s a profile for my dog pic.twitter.com/LmGY8lD73q. Drawing furries is so hard. (?? Like anthro ocs?) pic.twitter.com/rqULAXjC0u. (Did I use the wrong words? I don’t go here LMFAO). Haha you’re not losing it - Since now   They’re just not my thing so I’ve never really draw them but for artfight people have all kinds of humans and humanoids and animals and creatures for OCs so I’m trying to expand my horizons a bit and practice new things~. It’s hard to imagine being this Not Horny 
Reverse kink shaming. i wanna watch stranger things so badly dfhggdh waiting for my bro who is home in a couple days but then i realized..is he gonna wanna wait for his gf bc-------. I've watched s1+2 with them! throwback to when i drew the kids https:// twitter.com/cambrasine/sta tus/946280557884923904   …. pic.twitter.com/zERIHZFzBG. Lrt kiribaku.. GUHh please be proud of me I finally tried on the last remaining box of undergarments my mom saved from when she was around my size. trying on lingerie is the worst bc i always wanna keep the pretty frilly things yet i bother to wear even the comfiest bra probably 2 wks of the yr. called my bro to try to get my mom to calm down and all it did was make me more stressed sedrfghbjnkml,. guess i'm literally gonna go into my school and try to talk to a human person and try not to cry this is one of my least favorite things. can't believe i now "owe" even more money than when this ordeal began bc apparently it costs $1600 for a collections agent to make a phone call. LMFAOO I DONT THINK I HAVE A CHOICE it's probably gonna happen before i even get in the door..but first i have to make sure there even is a human to see bc i'm not going an hour into town for nothin'. Just found a small collection of stuff I bought for magical girl cosplay café...someday that’ll happen.... Cursed first edition Born to Make History zines circa 2016 .... just found these in a random box whole cleaning  pic.twitter.com/emF3bsna7f. Bro: go to bed early, don’t worry about cleaning 
Me: suddenly motivated to clean til 2 AM. Frustrated at my mom for depriving herself of sleep to help this manipulative asshole again and she texts me like ohh why did the call come thru and I’m like hey!! You still didn’t have to answer it even if it came thru!!! I think it said you can add characters year round so maybe it’s accessible then but just not a game? I’m new so don’t quote me. Instagram just showed me This ad pic.twitter.com/aK5OFK2xLU. My mom: He has 8 legs does that make him an ant?
Also my mom: His body is segregated
Me: mom u need to eat buddy. The electric guy said he needed to turn off the power for 15 mins and we were like are u sure just 15 cause we were literally about to cook lunch and he said yeah 
It’s been 45 mins so far. Over a full hour so far I’ve given up and eaten deli. Some more doodles for #artfight2019  ! 
Characters belong to liina-puff on dA and savior-of-the-dreaming-dead on tumblr pic.twitter.com/CaRJQXLWYA. Artfight is really like Gaia bc I go to all these artists profiles and they’re like fucking 14   so skilled! It’s pretty amazing. Idk why I always forget how much I love young the giant https:// m.youtube.com/watch?v=GehRsH pg84c   …. Rip. THEY LOOK SUPER CUTE. The most cursed image on my TL today . ((Sorry)). Spiderbby . Andbdhfndns imagine if in the game ... AAA I just saw it a couple days ago!! I really enjoyed it but also I’m soft for him anyway so I’m pretty biased! I hope you like it when you do see it !! . Eep!! I hope you can make it without getting spoiled . SHDBDUDNNS it’s so hard to avoid spoilers honestly   I’m rooting for you!! Halfway thru!! Good omens is so wild. I don’t know that I’ll have time to finish before my bro comes home tho . Took me a minute to get into it but yeah it’s wild but v exciting . AshdbdjWorking on organizing the art room so maybe eventually it can become a screen printing studio but it’s just insane bc all my con stuff + years of arts and crafts stuff + just like other people’s random shit like my bro’s poker stuff and my moms photos and broken stereo and. HDNDHDBDH THE OTHER DAY  I WAS THINKING BABY ME MUST HAVE POORLY DRAWN SOME NEOPETS AND I JUST FOUND THEM can u guess my favorite Neopet  pic.twitter.com/9ED2zELzEr. # Improvemenmeme  ?   I’m gonna guess age 8 -> 23 pic.twitter.com/YX0mGULdv3. Baby me could write in Hebrew   oops.. pic.twitter.com/qSNtvss6rx. Oof I left out a t in the tag welp. LMFAOO RIA THIS IS  GOLD. Wtf that’s WILD. I’ve gotten a couple strikes over the years but my shop is still up it’s crazy that they’d take such extreme action in one fell swoop and then prevent you from fulfilling orders?! Ugh I’m so sorry this is happening to y’all. Lrt the new is really miserable lately. I know it’s a privilege to be able to take a break from it but..do what you gotta do . Andy that’s a really beautiful gesture . had a dream where I made a Twitter poll abt whether Nezuko ends up being in the same box forever, getting a new box, not needing a box, etc. - which I can’t do bc spoilers- but the 4th poll option was “Schrodinger’s Nezuko” AND AWAKE ME THOUGHT THAT WAS HILARIOUS SO IM POSTING IT. Been getting a bit bleh about some of the new miraculous eps but I started watching the latest one and it’s lookin p good . Y’all how am I gonna watch eps 5+6 of good omens, miraculous, given, and Carole & Tuesday and also clean the whole house before my brother gets home tonight    help idk which to prioritize..I wanna watch good omens but it’s an hour so it’s a bad idea,others feel more bite sized. I think I only winked unironically one time ever in my life. Yeah I think Friday is more like whoever still has energy and date night but Saturday will be Everyone and families w little kids and big groups of friend. Always almost taking commmissions and then not shdbdn I’m so slow at drawing and time is so valuable...but also  $ . Hair color is a mysterious science and I know it can be disappointing when it’s not what ya wanted but just need u to know IT LOOKS REALLY COOL. sdfgdsg The Puppeteer 2 was some classic Miraculous!! . i'm having them arrested
and kink-shamed. HEBDHDBD. MY SURFACE DESIGN PROF just asked if I wanna TA her class aaaaa
BUT I CANT EVEN RE-ENROLL RN what fresh hell is this..meeting w financial aid guy Monday grr. Agree 100% . Even if I ignore all the other places they messed up - to tell me I need to pay x money then send it to collections LITERALLY THE NEXT DAY without giving me a chance to pay or get a loan or whatever is objectively terrible and not how anything should be run. It’s more complex and worse beyond that but . Agsbdjd thank you friend  . trying to pen a response to my prof that doesn't include blatant disdain for this establishment. dog in the distance: barking
cady: barking back
my mom: imitating barking 
me: eVERyonE sTOP. well I'm asking for more deets for now + when she needs an answer. it's exciting but also a responsibility..it's looking like I have to take out thousands in loans bc the school didn't post *their* date anywhere like they're supposed to + it's my fault for not magically knowing. There’s only one truth in this world and that truth is that the art room will never be clean. One day I will post a before (the chaos of several people), middle (my organized chaos), and after (functional space) photos of the art room .. but today is not that day . Hnn was thinking about it when going to Japan was on the table for the fall but it’s not anymore so  hate to give in and give them more money but don’t wanna delay my already slow progress thru school either. Aa thank you so much for stopping by and giving Teru a home . crowley tattoo - kirishima scar forgetting solidarity. scREAM only one ep left of good omens but...gotta..g.et bro from airport............................ My prof also told me she thinks I have a good chance at a contest I haven’t even entered bc it feels too off-brand which is v sweet but... Diane no . Savers or Michaels!! I hate when people write to tell you they’re /going/ to write to you later but I also hate people not writing anything. In conclusion, I -. Recently back in touch w someone I haven’t talked to since high school and turns out I update my contacts never so I was slapped in the face with this weaboo crime pic.twitter.com/mRYQHbIUQK. mmmmmmmmm turns out the only charm i really need more of is matsuri todoroki but I can't just order him so I guess..no matsuri todo??????...............D: i've never had this situation before..huh. ehh yeah but I don't think it'd come for my next con in two weeks if I order with a bajillion people so I may as well just .....wait I guess? :| hm. Ouch I .......didn’t get into AAC this year ... I do have several smaller local shows this summer/fall though, so I hope to see y’all there!!   Still waiting on An*meNYC results too but that’s a reach   https:// twitter.com/cambrasine/sta tus/1152310901837639681   … pic.twitter.com/tH6n6cp7yQ. Aaa yeah same!! I didn’t realize it would be so much smaller this year so I wasn’t super worried.. . Cade and I after walking in the “feels like 99 degrees” heat pic.twitter.com/MhejoYuYBE. Popcult you need a badge, Ladies Con and MICE are free! . Ugh heat in a city envrionment seems a lot worse somehow. Is it bad manners not to retaliate on artfight? I feel like it is but also the point is kind of to find inspiration so if their characters don’t do it for you or are outside of your comfort zone then..? Idk :(. When I draw for it I’m just looking for designs I like, not paying attention to the art of the person or expecting anything back but idk if that’s how the majority approach it or not? Omg!! Thank you all and also hello  . My mom: I remember all the details of stranger things
Also my mom: (describes p much episode one) 
Also her: wasn’t there only one season? Help my bro went to bed and I wanna watch an episode of smth 
(I’d finish good omens but that sounds like A Lot before bed). Oh she put her head on me pic.twitter.com/bSh0yTjlhO. I guess no anime now pic.twitter.com/E6LJnyvwHV. If you wanna know what Gay Panic TM looks like it is this pic.twitter.com/NJTYU7lreI. Given!! Its airing this season . I really wanna rewatch Hyouka. Aaa the OP is really good huh!! I started reading the manga but I have to get back to it - I’m guessing I prob read to what’ll be like episode 4 or so! New merch art w asheiji summer outfits makes me wanna draw summery art of them . Djdjdhdn I felt so so off yesterday,’ I’m feeling better atm which is good but I think I just overdid it with cleaning..I couldn’t get rid of my headache at all even with medicine and was nauseous all day and had a lot of moments where I got dizzy  gonna rest a bit longer now zz. wHAT. Aaa I only got spoiled for one thing bc of an anti-Given post  
But I’m looking forward to learning more of the story! The biggest of yikeses. Aaa ok!!! I think so too!! Maybe I’ll add to my bio “I don’t always attack back” . Yess!! I’m behind on that but I’m sure to do it !! Aaa yeah me too!  I also wanna get better at drawing other things so I have some anthro are animal creatures in there too ! Wish I could go back to that mild LA weather right about now . pic.twitter.com/X51y4gRBMj. my bro said not to stress about cleaning but I knew he’d freak anyway so I overdid it and felt shit yesterday and super tired today and now he’s complaining that I slept too late and asking me to clean more and like I can just feel my back and shoulders tense when he’s talking. pic.twitter.com/K2NmRqYL1S. Holy shit. pic.twitter.com/aHRn4x3V9v. Pretty good . W h at in the world
It’s 
It’s a drawing of two animals and they aren’t even touching ??? I don’t ???? I. Got so anxious/obsessive about organizing/cleaning that I couldn’t sleep the other night and yet here I am doing it again bc my bro can’t handle “not having a place to stretch” and my fucking back hurts ugh. It’s bc I didn’t repack my con stuff but I don’t just wanna throw things wherever when I have a con in 2 wks but in order to put those things on the table I have to clear the table but the things on the table go into bins which I need to get rid of things out of -thus The Problem. He could use the living room or his room or my room or go outside or—   like i wanna get this done too but I can’t do it all in a row. Ah yes Bc being horny for furries is definitely the same as actually wanting to fuck/abuse a real animal ok twitter . Sbdbhsbd yeah still this example is more than a stretch . Happy #cutiesaturday  !   Here is @sa9wa  's cutie Faya for #artfight2019  (Designed by pugsnot)

I'm not used to draw non-humans, so I hope I did ok! 

(Also asdfghjkl i'm sorry the crop is on her crotch i'm so sorry twitter is so cursed ...) pic.twitter.com/dZ0tsHyqEz. bro: since there's three of us, I cut it into eight pieces
me: pic.twitter.com/mxlO4wUtNc. FDGXHDFH TWITTER SHOWED ME IT WAS GONNA CROP THERE THEN IT DIDNT now i awkwardly wrote that omg. asdfghjkl RIP me. Eeeeeep!! I’m so glad you like it!!   I was nervous since it’s out of my comfort zone!! Also I didn’t even realize she was yours until I went to tag the creator and I was like HOLD UP— . Also omg the refs of her are the cutest things I’ve ever seen I was so inspired . SDCC is really ?? Not on my timeline that much? I keep forgetting it’s happening :O. Sleep blep pic.twitter.com/DdJ7Bqymhq. I’m yelling I literally looked at the overlay and said aloud “they’re different” bc 
they’re 
Different ????
How they think that’s ~evidence~ is kinda beyond me,  It’s literally just the same animal w a knife, chill. People are whack as hell man. what’s seriously confusing me is that they want them to change the design that’s clearly already not the same+they’re like here are examples of other ways it could be which would be ACTUALLY copying their art..which is what they’re falsely accusing them on in the 1st place?? I’m. Me@all of humanity all the time: /chill/. Twitter sure is full of shit this morning I’m done blocking people, going back to bed . Yeah esp the parts where they’re talking about fanart and also the part where they’re like ohh I wish this could’ve been avoided like literally you didn’t have to post that u fool. A mess. pic.twitter.com/Ershn0faGB. Someone pls give me this level of blind confidence. Walks into AA well guess this is hell full of morally dubious sinners. !! I know you’ve had a lot of crap lately and this was just the cherry on top but just wanna say I hope things improve for you soon!! My sales rep hasn’t replied and Popcult is less than 2 weeks away now . Aaa thank you so much for your support!! I hope you enjoyed the con! I’m loving all this bee solidarity..making good things out of something bad is so uplifting. I was about to comment this but I was like there’s no way someone hasn’t already said it - fancy seeing you here . THANK YOU   Such good timing finding these old drawings haha. yes!! I was hardcore into neopets back in the day.. I ran an absurd guild where we "rescued" neopets by adopting "undesirable" pets from the pound, using potions/brushes on them, and finding them new homes . Aaa thank you so much for the sweet words!!  I’m glad it arrived safely!! Good luck friend!! Ok so summary of meeting - part 1 guy was useless and indifferent and when I told him they should clarify on their website he went “yeah yeah yeah”. Part 2 Fin. aid lady was nice, switched her vaycay day to meet us, taking it back from collections so  $1600 in fees gone, lifting hold so can register for class but I’m still fucked for $4k +need to get a private loan bc they didn’t post their secret earlier deadline anywhere . Also apparently TAing for the arts college only gets you half the credit as the regular college get fucking wrecked.  almost almost almost done with this!!! ...but I’m also trying to spend time w my bro rn so not sure if an exact date pic.twitter.com/dcuR2zjJx3. Aaa thank you Jess!! I put a lot of care into it! . you ever almost forget smth but remember at the last second and you're like fucK YEAH. still don't want a pop funko but omg they even did kirishima's lil pointy cat eye i'm dyin.

Time to absolutely destroy my good credit score with student loan inquiries . If anyone has had a particularly good or particularly bad experience w a private student loan company lemme know.. https:// twitter.com/cambrasine/sta tus/1153747704419356674   …. uhhhhhhh I tried to scan this screen print not realizing that using blacklight inks would be a problem..u fool. me: let me tell you the situation I'm dealing with

Spider-Man: 3 - Spider-Man Gets Doxxed. Not a spoiler!
Walking out after the film and this guy behind us goes “so Peter Parker and Nick Fury are the same guy?” and the woman with him goes, “yeah, pretty much” and I ???????? Hello did we watch the same film. Shdbdkdnd maybe . ( Spider-Man spoiler)

I think maybe they didn’t get the whole Kree thing but I still don’t know how they got THERE. The human mind is a mystery. Just a heads up that I've moved over the Birthday Club stuff to my own form! Now no BS third party company will be collecting your email and also ASKING YOUR GENDER?? which was really bothering me!!

Any existing B-Day Club members have been transferred over so no worries! . No spoilers but damn the duffer brothers really don’t know when to quit huh. gwahh I still haven't accepted the TA offer...no money and /one and a half credits/ is pretty sad, but it'd be good for my resume which is currently practically nothing and I don't mind taking attendance, sending emails, etc. A bit worried about leading crit tho..In classes w. younger students like that I end up talking quite a bit bc I cANT STAND THE SILENCE but I still choke on my words a bit and have off days so setting a standard is stressful.. our TA was really quiet tho so maybe it's fine..HNNN idk. TT A TT aa everyone writing reviews is always so sweet...
also sorry if you ordered april/may I didn't send you a form bc I thought IT'S BEEN TOO LONG;; I usually send more frequently but yknow school, cons, etc.. Everything is so so convoluted. I just need one (1) loan why is this such a pain! Like!! You can’t get a LOAN at a BANK what is even happening ?? (They were like oh we can’t do that here u have to go online). whole thing is a mess!
Even tho my credit score is good I’m just a baby so it’s not long enough that anyone wants to give me a loan without a co-signer but they just recently told my mom she could get a part-time job (after the accident) so even together we can’t get approved. Am I gonna have to 
Put this on a credit card 
(Screaming). My mom is being annoying about it. Idk I just looked at it and bothered her and she said she’ll look at it. Hnn I feel this!! Sometimes you gotta just stop and do something that brings you peace or happiness!! Treat yourself!! I WONDER IF THIS WAS MY TABLE HOLY SHIT. I told them by June 30th so I could get some $ back and they just finally wrote me back today .. If only they had written to us both back then (stares into the distance). Omg that looks rad. More photos cause I have them! Info in original post, videos next! pic.twitter.com/Q2SkPnmPR7. Truck turnaround! Redesigned from the original to be a box~ pic.twitter.com/lEJMrdmy24. AA THANK U FRIEND . SERENA   YOU ALWAYS WRITE THE SWEETEST THINGS... Thank you so much!! Aaa I agree - I think whether this is popular or not it was a good exercise and I’m proud of it! Another thing to slap on the portfolio amirite . I am craving Reese’s sticks to the point of?? Insanity?? I want them so badly ohmyogdnfndjfn I don’t know the last craving I had so intense.. I think today was just ..a lot. My mom and I were both crying at points and hours in banks and staring at screens for nothing so. My body is like pls Jennie give me something immediately satisfying and fulfilling ..and that thing is.. Reese’s sticks. Anjdhsjd I feel like this is a perfect example of what it’s like looking for reference photos. omg.. haha less relief but more satisfaction   They’re so?? Hearty??  Like KitKats are good too but they are twigs compared to Reese’s sticks . Thank you! . I’ll never be over this pic.twitter.com/GbVjnkKmyk. Omg good luck friend. It’s a premonition. SPAM / SECURITY WARNING FOR ARTIST ALLEY/EXHIBITORS  

I’ve been getting these BS emails lately for multiple cons - even small ones! They’re spam, and *as far as I can tell* are getting contact info from following links on the site - NOT the fault of any con or data breach. pic.twitter.com/CaHewpXUgM. Can’t believe I got one for Popcult - it’s so small!! It literally doesn’t even have that many attendees as in the email.. NOWHERE IS SAFE . AA THANK U HARU you’re so sweet . Thank you friend!! I made it clear how many times the school has failed me and explained why we’re unable to get a loan and the financial aid lady was v understanding so she’s gonna work on a payment plan even though it’s normally way too late for that for the past semester   hnn. Aaah thank you so much!! Yeah all the problems are interconnected so it’s hard to solve but I gotta do smth or else I can’t go to school so . Aaa thank you so much!!   It was my first time doing clear stickers/white ink and it came out so well!! AGSBDJDJ THANK U SO MUCH AND LOTS OF HARD WORK .  eeeeep THANK YOU!! Lmfaoo watch the “payment plan” be like 1k a month .

LMFAOO 

...maybe they just have different vibes too or feel like different times of day?? 

(sept -> july) pic.twitter.com/bEWgtZX7CP. actually not sure how many of y'all will see this since I didn't mention a poll but -- i'm pretty curious of your personal color preferences in case I do smth w it? pics in OP. also definitely asking for no reason--

water - or whatever you like to drink - bottle preference? guhh should probably try on lolita dresses + cosplay and see what doesn't fit anymore and sell it ; n;. current mood: having this tab open for two weeks and counting pic.twitter.com/3ozS6Yai5Z. YALL IM CRYING —- I had a sample made and it looks exactly how I imagined its sooooo cute —- BUT THE PATTERN IS UPSIDE DOWN. I like - I was so elated I SQUEALED and then I was like “....wait” . Update: caught em before they shipped it and they’ll remake   It’s just funny bc I sent it to them the right way, and they mocked it up correctly too, so just some miscommunication..hopefully I can show y’all soon, but it’s something I’ll need your help to actually get made! Aaa thank you Belén!  I think I know what you mean!! One of the changes was making the water a greener blue and I think that moving it closer on the color wheel to the rest gives it a more harmonious feeling!!  thank you Dani!!! Eeep!! Thank you!! I’m glad you like it, my hard work paid off! OH NO that is surprising...new or used? maybe you can complain to whoever and get some $ back;;. Oof my m*ce table is free thru the school but you only get 2 ft of space ouch. This email is really like “baby’s first table” guidelines heh. Photo of me trying to fit enamel pins, zines, stickers, prints, screen prints, totes, bandanas, and also ME in two feet of space pic.twitter.com/xyOKoq4GeW. Oof that’s rough buddy. dsfgdfgfh i'm torn about how much of what to bring bc i was like yay my screen prints will be valued but my brain is also like....people still like some fan art right?? i saw some at MICE I think.. asdfghjkl anyone who has exhibited at #MICE  #MassMICE  wanna give me protips on how much original vs fan art to bring? Torn because I think it'll be more like Flamecon where original and handmade is valued more but also big fandoms are big... dfgsijgfdh /rolls around
I have like
3 months to figure this out but of course i'm already losing my mind. Was this like a blind bag or smth ?? Yeah holy shit there’s so many big ticket items in this wow. Wonder if the name of this company has anything to do with why it’s on sale ... pic.twitter.com/kJs5MmdLHL. Makes sense! That p much checks out with what I saw when attending the last couple years. I’m just used to doing anime cons where everyone’s dying for keychains of their fave characters   Excited to try a show where people will care about screen prints!!! thank you so much! Particularly disgusted with the news today. mom: my information was compromised in the equifax breach
me: COOL SO WE GET A HUNDRED BUCKS
mom: ...yeah but some motherfucker has my information!
me: ...but we could really use that hundo--. mom: you were not impacted
me: son of a bi----I mean uh..great. sorry and also congrats. the kids from the family that moved in last fall are obsessed with their giant water trampoline ........ i can hear them right now, which seems crazy bc yknow it's pitch black outside and a cool 74 but they were out the other day when it was getting dark, 68, and RAINING. me: I want to support all my creator friends!
me, suddenly not having enough money to fund my own projects: fuck. MANY YEARS LATER I FINISHED GOOD OMENS. IT WAS VERY GOOD. sorry I'm not an analytical person but I really really enjoyed it and I'm happy to look at fan works without worrying for spoilers noW!!! * U*. omg this is so precious. i felt pretty crappy since last night and after a nap I feel a lot better but yknow it's late already so i didn't accomplish much today ; n;. Just made some of my kids~
It's honestly soo cute and I sometimes struggle with these but yours had so many solid options that I was able to make it work for them !! * U* Amazing job and perseverance!! pic.twitter.com/CC5akmipAX. Hnn mostly just having to safety pin closed the neckline of low cut shirts and dresses bc otherwise the cloth just flops around . OH NOOORNBFDJSBDBXB. Huh. A recurring theme in my dreams for years and years is I can never dial 9-1-1 — my phone will break or I’ll hit the wrong buttons over and over — but I just realized I was able to in my dream last night..but it was for someone else in trouble, not myself.

either Kirishima or my OC meru..she's an ice cream magical girl mermaid ...girl..LMFAOO!! It'd be the hardest decision :O. I thought everyone had finally shtopped yelling at each other and then turns out what actually happened was my 30 day mute of 10094848 words had expired . It’s really stressful/frustrating too when you see people you follow or look up to or are friends w saying extreme things and you’re like oh gotta make a mental note of that . SHSHDHNDB YES holy shit I have friends like that too...well maybe not  d*ath threat level but p extreme . Ugh it’s the worst when you know you need to stop but you can’t stop funneling energy into something negative / unproductive :( Usually I try deep breathing/progressive muscle relaxation to calm and going outside to distract!! Hope you feel better soon. Yeah and it fucking hurts too when you think you’re buddy buddy w someone and see them saying really disgusting things that apply to you and you’re like “so that’s what they really think of me” on some level yknow. I heard mini backpacks are in pic.twitter.com/a6Ny5oWZ1I. Losing my mind bc my mom told the storage unit people we were going to try to clean it out this weekend - not that we WOULD finish and they were like ok clear it by Monday morning so now we’re on a deadline and Adams coming home tonight and he’s gonna freak if there’s stuff. everywhere but the donation places are all far away and there’ll be traffic and I’m dyING. LITERALLY WHAT THEUFCKDfgdg. I don't even know how I would respond to this I'd probably just sit there with my mouth open.. shocked pikachu . jpeg. Ahaha damn we could’ve matched  
Still can’t find my pochacco bag tho . Literally what is happening to you this weekend. Don’t have to apologize for using your accounts how you want!  sorry you’ve been having family stress > n<. OH NOOO.. I've been going through storage units and finding MLP stuff and like..am I going to have a children's vintage MLP party?? NO BUT I CANT LET IT GOOOO TT A TT Good luck friend...I'd give u strength to resist if I had it. Now *this* is the kind of content I signed up for. Tw suicide//

Tfw your previously suicidal friend starts posting dozens of suicidal memes   help. Other coast :( talked to him for a bit and put him in my favorites so it’ll go through no matter what. Since she low key expects u to do all the assignments again too and I have a few small cons + flying out for my bro’s defense I was just going to TA + 1 class but TA is less credits so now I have to take another class too fjdndn.  (not pictured: like 20 freaking ponies) pic.twitter.com/F94obrN7bJ. OK! So looks like all the Kirishima Plush have been delivered properly so now there are just *TWO LEFT* for forever.

Discount to $18 (+ shipping) due to clothing errors (poorly cut vest/bandana, double printed pockets, pant seam issue, etc.) They are still very lovable though! pic.twitter.com/QNssW6IJLv. IM GONNA SCREAM they told me I was denied a student loan bc of a collections account....which was..THE FUCKING SC/HOOL !! the school took it back but it still showed up ..the irony . i'm dead. me: how many should I order
mom: (long pause)
mom: ...might be good for soup
me: ?!? p*nimelt RT'd someone's post with a picture of the banana hat and I legit was like 'wait does this person have my hat' ... no jenn, other people also own this hat. looks like cady is eating gourmet tonight bc all three of us didn't realize we were running out of dog food. mom: cady, toot toot! move~
cady: (walks in a full circle around the island and stops in the exact same place). Me every time I open photoshop. Stan pic.twitter.com/Sc6rgTQp3J. Sorry I know nothing abt kpop but I saw a joke opportunity and I took it 

Also go support@j*nnyknits who created this beautiful creature and many more. Wehhh I wanna pack for Popcult but my prints aren’t coming til tomorrow. big same. I've got sooooo many stuffed animals to donate but nowhere freaking takes them!!!!!! It's so frustrating! Places that do take stuffed animals only take new ones, too. They're all clean and nice and need homes TT A TT. literally the only place that'll take them is Savers and idk Savers is...fine.  but i'd rather they go directly to somewhere. ABSBDHDBDJ It doesn’t help when you know what’s best for you but don’t want it to be that way hnn. I am soooo impatient to see my sample w the fabric printed right-side up i've been absolutely losing my mind abt it sdfgfdg. yesterday was the last day for a discount but my contact replied late (even apologized for the delay) so I gave up and went to sleep..I hope she still honors the coupon. Just got up from sitting at a table and said “I need to move around” then went and sat on the couch

Sleepy day zz. I did get orders done tho!!! So if you preordered buttons/charms at AX or online that just came in it's headed to the post office~. Finally bought clamps for screen printing!! It’s only $10 but still being a little idealistic considering there’s still a lot of cleaning, sorting, and figuring to be done before that room resembles a studio like it should. Still I want to make more totes and bandanas for Ladies Con and MICE and I left some stuff burned into my screens so maybe I can figure that much..don’t really have $150 to give my school for studio fees . Going to try to salvage some totes from a while ago by hand painting! I was impatient and burned the image too close to the edge which caused Problems lmfaO wish me luck!! Hnn that’s as good as it gets, folks. I experimented filling in the inconsistent white on a worse mess up but it looked..bad so. I think the gradient is more charming than that pic.twitter.com/SI2w6DzqoD. Someday I will reprint these and they will be GLORIOUS. Lmfao 
Me: I’ll charge less for these bc they’re imperfect
Me: (spends a couple hours hand painting them). Someone give me hundreds of dollars to join a makerspace. Slime time   it’s art experiment day apparently bc my brain may melt if I spent a sixth consecutive day cleaning. Sorry if I RT kiri plush post a lot I’m just trying to avoid the inevitable “oh no I missed him :(“ after like a year and a half of him being around . Body is failing I think I just need more water. W a t e r. Doesn’t it tho. Tomorrow will be one whole week since my school told me we could do a payment plan and then didn’t provide me with the payment plan to see if it’s even really a possibility. Don’t ask me if I followed up with them already cause u know i tried. Ohh the AA is on the main floor this year instead of the basement . Aaaa thank you Dani   unintentional but I kind of dig it too! @ riasaur  almost definitely ? ? pic.twitter.com/O9xhprdg8W. No prob!! Seems like their store is closed for the moment tho. <3 <3 <3 
PS happy to see you got into ladies con!! I had a feeling you would so I waited to ask you to share (eyes emoji) now we can request to be next to each other tho if ya want ~. LRT HEARING BAKUGOU SAY “TO WIN AND SAVE” MADE MY HEART GO . If you ever wanna feel fucked up just watch a PBS special about space. /space/ . RIP it's not happening :( I was so excited.. LMFAOO MY REP. pic.twitter.com/UeNZ6jvEmp. "yeah i also wouldn't pay that much" - shit you prob shouldn't say at work. "Cool!! More money!!" - me, forgetting I had a refund in P*yPal. a true icon. While cleaning we donated three boxes of books - but here are some of the ones I kept - either bc I remembered them fondly or for the art  pic.twitter.com/X5fowbC1mB. Yess!!! I also kept Corduroy if you know that one too . Reproductive organs at it again this month with the stabby stabs . Pls buy from me at Popcult so I can tone my hair and also go to college. Otherwise I have to choose and one’s cheaper than the other but I won’t say which (it’s not college). Aaa I read it again just now and it’s such a simple and lovely story even now . Aaa I wonder when the new movie will come out here.. last time it was July in japan and September in the US or something like that? So maybe February or March .. EVERY TIME I HEAR THIS IT TAKES FIVE YEARS OFF MY LIFE Idk why I thought we were past this (gazes longingly into distance). Monday the latest since I have a con this weekend but I’m going to try for Saturday :). ....I’m going back to bed pic.twitter.com/tYS1Vi4eNe. This headache go away but I can’t find my bag which is where meds are..usually have another bottle around but no luck and I can’t focus well to continue so gonna sleep and hoped for best. LRT also good news!! you can have meaningful platonic relationships!!!!!

Lrt NSBSHDBD. I feel this on a spiritual level cause my bun hates his nails cut we gotta do em like one at a time 

Also reminder not to flip your bun over to clip their nails bc I don’t remember exactly you look it up but it puts them in this bad stressful state. Beauty pic.twitter.com/5bk4E27is7.

“Yeah I haven’t eaten today..I probably should”
“Yeah you better or else I will literally obliterate you, Catherine”. It’s really funny bc PopCult is aggressively beach themed and yet this morning was overcast and raining . Why can’t I RT this. Omg my brain did smth bad reading this (like implying that the good people and good pets were going to become the good meat..). Still thinking about the girl at the airport yesterday whose t-shirt declared, “VIRGINITY ROCKS”. I have never seen a whiter, bleach blonde, blue-eyed family in my entire life. Do what you want it just seems like a really uncomfortable thing to loudly declare to the world and it just prompts you to think of sex?? hnn yeah I agree like never would i look at someone think 'are they a virgin' unless their shirt stated one way or the other dsfgdfh. LMFAOO RUDE . I'll have u know i was set up on time for AX................we're just. tired.
also I was only done like 15 mins late it was fine and i would've been better off if they didn't switch rooms cause I had to find it and we didn't know what door to park at.

zzzz. it's not a competition but if it makes u feel better they absolutely m*rdered my ass two days ago bc my mom lost her glasses in the woods and i had to look for them (and her) for like an hour and a half while wearing a tank top. hydrocortisone that shit. lrt me after excitedly chatting with customers at cons
i'm not faking having fun talking to you, i just go immediately into power-saver mode. it was D:

omg really? I thought it was popular but maybe not!
huh!! Coolburn sensation sounds interesting..maybe I'll try it next time I get chowed on!! 

Another is wetting a facecloth/running bite under  hot water for a few seconds and it hurts like a b*tch then feels fine. I went to sleep really early and woke up too early ..this happens exactly never of the time. Sometimes I wake up and look at twitter and get immediately frustrated but sometimes I feel so calm and I’m just like you fools,, you could take a nap instead of yelling at each other on the Internet. I’m in a particularly good mood but also suddenly a lot of pain today but I’ll try to take breaks and stay upbeat!! Hopefully meds help some. I’m pretty sure we’re not legally allowed to call it an anime convention unless I get my period. “It’s funny how much you notice going through a second time” - guy looking at the sale bin I put out one minute ago .

Ehh I’d lewd my own ocs but. I think there was a second half to this sentence but i forgot it i'm sorry. Thank y'all for stopping by at #PopCultAnimeCon  ! I

had a very chill weekend and I'm very thankful to be able to put another little chunk towards tuition!

If you post haul photos please feel free to tag me!! . post-con brain LMFAO. YESS omg I'm excited to see her!! Lrt omg today this kid was shaming their dad about not knowing the big 3 and I went “oooh is he an anime only” jokingly then realized you prob shouldn’t do that to the person who gave you their credit card . T.V.: NEWS TIME!!
Me, scrambling for the remote: oh god oh god 
T.V.: WEEKEND OF TERROR 
Me: nnnnNNNNNNNNNNNN. I was cramping and sweating all night in my 66 degree room so I’m about to go eat tiny donuts and I don’t fucking care. OHCRAP I was busy w my bro leaving and the con I will do kiri lottery by tonight. Lrt woah. Bad relatable feeling: jumping out of bed and running to the door for a package you thought you had to sign for. Outcomes: 
> You get it - succeed but feel sick
> You get it - but you didn’t need to sign so you’re sick and annoyed 
> You watch as they pull away with your package still in the truck 
> You rip open the door only to find the package is already at your feet. I was the fourth one but to be fair FedE* almost always leaves without delivering my package even when I leave a properly filled out special f*dex slip (that you have to like *get* not print out) which I did thank you very much. When watching the PBS special about Voyager there was a phrase I really liked and it’s not like it’s original or hasn’t been used for something but I just enjoy it and I’m holding onto it for something some day that suits it. Aaa wanna get back to artfight or doggust or smth and be productive this month !! Feel like I haven’t drawn much lately..Maybe just havent finished big things. I’ll DM ! Someone at PopCult this weekend: well they left (the Banana Fish manga ending) open-ended
Me: yeah
Me, internally: no. I was like “uh haha yeah just don’t read the epilogues..”   If they had said anime I would’ve said ok believe what you want but the manga is .. “I’m sorry was I not CLEAR?”. I’m sorry Reese’s sticks are just the best candy (citation: my taste buds). YOU AND THESE PHOTOS LOOK SO GOOD I’ll never get over it . why do people keep buying my shit on ebay then not..paying for it.........................not helpful u nu. Whoo!! I did the Kiri plush lottery via random number generator and congrats to Ozzy and Ariel! I'll be e-mailing you later today!!

(PS I took video proof but I didn't realize some people had their full names visible so I won't post, DM me if you've got an issue :P). :D pic.twitter.com/1A0Okc4Wuy. pic.twitter.com/SrghnOYbuK. Fun message from a relative. Literally what prompted this, it better be spam pic.twitter.com/hn6dnHzjWc. Oh god am I really gonna get into this w him. A quick google search shows that a judge will make a decision based on your actions not your Facebook friends or the police please stop pic.twitter.com/rZSOe96ByA. “Just spreading misinformation and propaganda to my friends and family”. Like yeah if u post on Facebook “I’m gonna shoot some people” I think a judge should be able to take away your gun u absolute fool. i didn't realize how much of a younger crowd popcult was until i was there again  - and now I'm counting inventory and I barely sold any banana fish (mature) and tokyo mew mew (older) and i'm like shockedpikachu.jpeg. casually throws like 20 charms@u LMFAOO. TBH if I had a ton of 12-16 year olds asking me for BF merch I would be pretty concerned awesdrfcgvhbjnk. not sure how i ended up packing orders on a monday... (since I usually ship weekly on saturday). (((probably by avoiding other responsibilities like cleaning))). I had just been adding and checking things off on my to do list for a few weeks so it got longer than my laptop screen lmfao I just cleaned it up tho............theres always more things to do..life. my - NOW EX-FRIEND - when I pointed out that one of my customers has technically ordered more Kirishima plushes than I kept for myself: pic.twitter.com/6C7W0swPJh. how dare u look down on my love for him. hmmmmmmmmmmm. before i looked it up 20 seconds ago I thought any feral hog reference would surely be related to inosuke... going through and deleting notes bc thats the level of energy i have remaining and it's a nightmare bc they're all mish-mashes of random crap like this one from a year and a half ago is suggestions my screen prof gave me for where to buy supplies and also my chinese food order. My mom decided to clean the bathroom really well which is uh great but (gestures to the living room which still has several piles of things from the storage unit to deal with). We decided to take today off but my brain doesn’t let me do that so I ended up working on stuff anyway so I guess it was a more productive day than planned. y'all I just bought AGAIN this dress that a couple months ago they oversold+refunded and i won't believe it til its here?? I just looked it up for the first time since that debacle on a whim and although previously completely removed from the site it is now back up in my size. I'VE BEEN GOOD ABOUT NOT BUYING THINGS ever since The Financial Aid Incident and i had a stupid coupon code from them fucking up so i'm trying not to feel bad about it. also just generally really digging blue/pink combos lately - particularly light pink-peach w electric blue-indigo. Um so it’s an elitist comic con or   Also they titled this “URGENT” smh pic.twitter.com/VSsa1Roudq. It’s called D*stopia Sci-F* Con
I think the goal is really idealistic like “only people who will buy from you with less competition and no over-crowding” but that wording plus their URGENT TABLES ARE GOING FAST GET ONE NOW attitude ticked me off ..esp when this was unsolicited. Omg ok I caught up on the manga I didn’t even get spoiled that person was just saying unfounded stuff....you can’t call smth confirmed til it’s confirmed yknow !!! Also I Really don’t think he has amnesia.. This guy who did our bathroom messed up installing the drain back in December and we still haven’t been able to get him to come back. he was supposed to come today and why am I surprised. DFSGSFH CADY JUST PULLED DELI MEAT OFF THE TABLE when our backs were turned,,, the GALL!!! She's never done that before, though one time when she was a babe I looked back and she was licking my open face sandwich which I didn't appreciate. Ohmygod my mom just reminded me of the existence of Anberlin. HE IS VERY CUTE. Aw. One of our nice neighbors are leaving. Sucks :(. Hn I feel this so much friend. Traveling really provokes anxiety (for me at least) and can be stressful but  as soon as you get home you’re comfy but back to all the same problems, annoyances, responsibilities, etc.. that guy arrested in Harvard square today..they found him at the Ben & Jerry’s in that mall...... it's such a weird little mall.. since my bro is on another continent that doesn't really do addresses we can't do anything for his birthday and my mom has been torturing me w ecards for like 30 minutes please someone call the p*lice. (softly) boys 2 and 4 as a set. I can’t even imagine. I know you two are doing your best and that’s all you can do . A baby-faced alchoholic falls for a dumb good for nothing and they hate fucked at work 

I immediately lost it at “baby-faced alcoholic” and it was all downhill from there,, this is the most chaotic story I —  https:// twitter.com/Renta_Yaoi/sta tus/1158966632124780544   …. Y’all
Coffee shop AU but the barista mishears the customer the 1st time they come in and writes the wrong name on their cup. They don’t correct them bc they’re so lovestruck and the barista calls them the wrong name throughout their budding romance and several weeks into dating. Bonus points if it comes out when the barista finally meets the customers friends “so...why do you keep calling them ___?” “..cause that’s their name?” “?!” 
At this point the customer has gotten so used to it they reply to it as if it’s their name. THANK U asdfgh. I am not sure what’s going on w cady :( hopefully she’s just got a cold or smth.. Sketchbook chaos pic.twitter.com/YUhM1hP43o. I wanted to get a gift for my professor so I got two small things but now I can’t decide which to keep and which to give her . I think it kinda depends what kind of world the author built around it too! THEYRE BOTH CUTE THO  
Stock photos bc the lady at the shop folded them nicely so I don’t wanna undo  pic.twitter.com/KDO1JwdJFh. Yeah like some explore secondary gender inequality and others are like uh slavery and amputation and stuff. So. Can’t believe I’m writing this on main but - yeah for porn I think the desperation aspect is hot . My mom just found documentation of all my early art achievements  pic.twitter.com/ubYzmj4pdI. tw body horror?

anxiety + screen time = the kind of migraine where you're pretty sure your eye is just going to pop right out of the socket. Aaa this artist I’m collabing with (again after many years) is so sweet and gives me frequent updates so I’m never worried or ghosted its amazing. Meanwhile my school: says let’s make a payment plan but doesn’t send it to me, email twice and call once and get a response two weeks later w STILL NO PAYMENT PLAN asking “what classes did u want again I can’t find the email” . It’s causing me so much stress like I know we will make it work but I want to know how bad/immediate it is or not . I’ve been getting so many more migraines bc it’s subconsciously weighing on me even more. Last night I had a nasty migraine so I half watched kids shows in bed as one does when they are sick and in my dream the Disney actor who came out as bi tried to steal my con money but I caught him, but then he succeeded stealing my ita bag :( rude. Wanna draw...g1 ponies . Finally went back and finished a drawing of @pamyurin  I started a looong time ago (Think Fall....2017..)  

I'm glad at least now I have the skills to get it closer to how I envisioned than I did back then!

Process gif attached!  pic.twitter.com/Z9BD5CvggD. Process! I did this chaotically by a combo of saving in new files and turning off layers but mostly accurate! She started off so crooked..  pic.twitter.com/HMt50ue1tL. I forget that I should post my illustrations here at night cause it’s dead during the day . AAA THANK U FRIEND!! LRT Holy shit   I wonder how long before someone shows Horikoshi and what he will think. someone pat me on the back for remembering to put merch on my 0% interest credit card and not straight outta the bank. literally the first time since I got it in March DFGTDHh. me: ugh what is the printing company's problem?
printing company: (two legitimate mistakes I made)
me: oh. Ironically I waited to today to send this in cause I make stupid mistakes when I have a headache but then I still made stupid mistakes   But we’re good now . LRT WOW THIS IS CUTE. OH it's Given day!!! dfsgfdg I went for walks but mostly was on screens way too long the last few days so I decided to get off my butt and clean today but I worked on my room instead of. yknow. getting my artist alley stuff out of the living room. oops.. spoilers w no context
WHAT A TERRIBLE SPOT TO END THE EPISODE
also omg what a terrible thing to say about someone that's. ignorant af. RLS bein' a real b*tch rn. I think my room is the cleanest (clutter wise) it’s been ..ever. (Like since we moved to this house almost two years ago)....Still a lot to go through and re-organize but like..oh shit . I don’t have experience with this but I’m guessing they should pay u out of pocket for the promo stuff for the Kickstarter and then if the project is successful then they give u the money they raised and u do the rest of the work? . It’s totally reasonable to not want to work unpaid or hard for a *maybe* yknow? unless you’re super passionate about it and are ok with that but from your post it sounds like it was someone else’s thing. Aaa good luck!! I hope it works out . SO HAPPY FOR YOU!!   Excited to see what awesome things you create! Oh gosh I have a bun and I can *hear* the wrattling in my head . GOOD ART GOOD REC THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. Stupid credits grrrr school is full of frustration!!! A few credits shy to take a class. If I’m paying I should get to choose how I spend my money and time . Sometimes I stop and wonder why I’m doing this then I remember that I don’t know what else to do for the moment. Neopets stickers arrived   
It’s hard to capture the color..
I’ll be shipping out preorders soon!

They’re in my shop@ http:// cambrasine.art/shop-all    and I’ll have them at local shows Ladies Con and MICE this fall! pic.twitter.com/ZOVMQeEk9o. Ohhh!! While cleaning I found a water bottle I thought I lost and my favorite glasses . Hope you feel better soon!! pic.twitter.com/fBlM9L0jeM. Omg     That’s so precious!! I kept a few for myself and one of mine also loses his pants . Also I have to know if you just love Kirishima or if you’re building a small army. Waitlisted again for An*meNYC  I know a lot of friends got in last year — sending y’all good luck vibes to y’all! Also I hit my head while cleaning I can feel the bump already . And my credit report went down /fifty-eight points/ bc I got a new card in case I have to pay for school that way.. I’m only using 4% of my credit limit rn and I haven’t even charged anything yet that seems so harsh  trying to have a peaceful day.. Their loss tbh . I took a 2nd year course and two 3rd year courses while credit-wise a freshman but now I can’t as a halfway through sophomore ?? why are u being difficult all of a sudden . More of a “disappointed but not surprised” kinda mood . Ahbshdbd you’re too sweet   Last year I felt like the only one who didn’t get in but this year I’ve seen a lot of my skilled friends get rejected too, 1500 apps is so intense . Holy shit GOOD JOB!! Also in my experience it’s *pretty good* - not amazing bc since it’s juried there’s tons of super skilled people and it costs soo much to stay in the city, but I’d say do it!!! the furuba ED gets me every time!! the style is so round and fuzzy I can't handle it!! * U*. Just looked at my arms and thought “wow I got really tan” then remembered I’m wearing sunglasses. Fat Pikachu orb is my new religion pic.twitter.com/SVZK4ZkVOx. Also this muffin is why I had chocolate under my thumb nail  pic.twitter.com/UkC2b4fMao. I love . Old Pokémon merch . The orb is what sustains him. Aaa I found some of those too!! Like Mew!! If you destroy his orb...he destroys everything else. Yeah   Airbnb’s and hotels are crazy expensive so if you don’t know anyone in the area I’d suggest splitting with someone else who’s going. Seriously it’s been almost every other YouTube ad for me for like . Weeks. pic.twitter.com/GK4QoeWQfI. You’ve got two months, make them count . I eat . A lot of bread. Deadass about to go to bed at 10:30. I was falling asleep earlier just in my regular clothes in bed but I got up to change, pee, etc and now I’m having heart palpitations and can’t sleep@my body why are u like this. (Shrug emoji) pic.twitter.com/es9kJLSHqc. Me: I wonder if Zambi will see this 
You: *magically appears as if summoned*
. Hnn im p sure im not concussed but boy I sure did hit my head good and hard and one a /point/. I’ve never had headaches/pain like this for so long after from bumping my head before asdffjk. This is such a valid tweet ohmygod . THESE ARE SO CHARMING (pun not intended) They’re so cute in your style! You two are so good I can’t get over these . I don’t think I’ll ever be over Dalmatians I just love them. I was unhealthily obsessed w 101 Dalmatians when I was little. I watched the different movies a lot sure and regular merch but also I had a cute coat+muff in Dalmatian print and ears headband, a clip on tail and I remember crawling around the dining room pretending to be a dog.. Also one time when I was little I called my brother a bastard and my mom was like WHERE DID U HEAR THAT And I cited the movie I was like don’t the villains says that on the phone and she was like jenn they definitely don’t say that!!! It’s Disney . It says it’s in America is this real life 
the implications of this are huge..if it fits and is comfy...I may wear it..like every day pic.twitter.com/bGIP9pCedp. Also absolutely no one asked but here she is  pic.twitter.com/GpjeEUJgA3. Um. Are there . Two bumps on my head? I only remember hitting it..once....... uh that’s not good. Concern mild -> moderate. My prof just emailed me again like hey the thing+it took me 2 weeks 2 emails+a phone call to get a reply from the school and just yesterday she passed off making a payment plan to someone else!! Literally what were they doing for two weeks now I have to suffer another weekend . Not ready to show the rest just yet but the fluffy corner has been restored to its rightful state! I need to fill in the space w more prints tho I’m so indecisive! 

And my dresser is clear too, but I need to find a way to re-organize it cause 1000 tiny boxes is not ideal. pic.twitter.com/RIFclZYOBr. IT SURE DOES . It’s still up in UK sizes 10 and 12 last I checked . OH DAMN!! Your handle is so funky tho! Mine’s just a lock+key I threw things on?? pic.twitter.com/H8x6mb7hEP. Omg that’s pretty nice tho!! I see you’ve put it to good use . Lmfaoo that’s a big mood I just found like a dozen my little ponies and instead of being like Jennie u don’t need those I’m like hmm I do have a spare shelf laying against the wall... . i feel like i'm making the most random assortment of ponies together bc two of the movies merged into one in my brain lmfao. I SURE DO LOVe..THINGS.  LOTS OF TINY THINGS!! KNY ANIMATION TEAM WENT FUCKING HAM THIS WEEK oh my god!!!! Are our rooms??? The same???? pic.twitter.com/XAJ1NviuiO. YESSS IT WAS SO EXCITING AND THE ANIMATION WAS GORGEOUS wow!!! Omg you’re so right if I was a dragon I guess my hoard would be tiny animal and human shaped figurines   ...and tiny plush anime boy keychains. It’s by @lazyoaf  !  omg that book is full of beautiful drawings!! Thank you so much! Sleeeepy. So soft and sweet . Surprised that Demon Slayer is trending but obviously the animation team deserves it * U*. sgdfg maybe the wait will make it even sweeter?? OR AT LEAST TELL YOURSELF THAT TO MAKE IT THROUGH. making a k*ckstarter kills brain cells tbh. you just keep remembering more shit u have to do before you're done It Suxxx ps pls support me love u. deadass googled uncooked pizza for reference. dfsgdfg gosh It's been so long admittedly, should get back into it..just remember baby me thinking every sexy anime character would have his voice  
This is prob a really basic answer but the ones I remember listening to: Take Me Out, Do You Want To, Right Action, No You Girls. zambi's 6th sense :O. No luck seeing shooting stars but omg it’s COOL OUTSIDE ..coming back inside with my cheeks feeling cold to the touch..a foreign sensation after so many months!!

It’s been three days and there’s still a bump on my head djdncgjk. Three days ago . I was putting something on an open shelf and leaned down and was like “uh” cause apparently a metal frame was sticking out on the top of the shelving unit and I hit my head on the corner of it fjdnnf. yeah :( tylonel + ice. oh my god my uncle is handing my mom's number out to scammers. she should change it and also not tell him  b YE. tfw your supplier undercharges you for shipping by mistake and asks u to pick up the bill .

I can't cut Glory she's so iconic............... Went out and saw a few shooting stars! The first one was a fireball which was so beautiful but it ruined me for the rest of them!! . Had a dream where MAPPA drew Ash into the background of a random school anime and he was pretty happily chowing down on a big pile of Valentine’s chocolate he received.. popular boy .. I love. Did someone do this yet pic.twitter.com/RaI76GMv7S. *likes and subscribes*. OHH OH!! OR the chocolates are 10% from his secret admirers of all genders and 90% from his gang  

There are so many good directions for this ,, I love... SPOIL HIM!! I hate to be the 1 to tell u but he’s STARVING and DEPRESSED .. much like my striped kacheek. He purr. Pour one out. Omg I’m famous. You’re welcome . This one's my favorite of the new releases https://www. youtube.com/watch?v=HK-mqy F3dV0   …. Trying to learn to draw the siblings but tanjiro is so tricky for some reason. Carole & Tuesday cover of One Man Band by Old Dominion please . Been flyin' solo for so long
Nobody's singin' the harmony
Up there just me and my shadow
No bass, no guitar, no tambourine
And I found you like a melody
You were singin' in the same key as me
We had 'em dancin' in the streets
...Carole ..and ..Tuesday .. I CANT GET OVER THESE . Since my mom won’t give him money (bc we don’t Have it) he’s trying to get her to convince our wealthy relatives who we barely talk to to loan him money y’all this is so tired. Wish I could be in the pond but also in the shade at the same time. AGSNJFKDKDLTL oh my god.....honestly tho——. eeep!! Maybe that’s it! I think part of it is when the mangaka has a unique style you have to figure out how to reconcile it with your own. Great minds think alike. Don’t trust anyone who doesnt try their name, nicknames, and aliases for the best result . Me@9: my head hurts I’m going to bed 
Me: (wakes up)
Me: wonder what time it is! Probably like 3 or 4
Phone: not even 1
Me: ex..cuse u....u must be..mistaken. (Thank you for this tweet bc I turned off my alarm like a fool). Omg   just when I thought these couldn’t get any more precious. Me: I keep waking up sweating even tho it’s 68 in my room
Mom: well I don’t know Jenn you’re wearing winter pajamas and sleeping under three blankets 
Me: ....no I don’t think that’s it. Sometimes you take meds and you feel better but sometimes you take meds and the pain isn’t sharp anymore but it’s Definitely Still There and just feels kinda dull and weird and that’s where I’m at rn. casually draws nezuko and tanjiro in modern clothing bc it's too hard to learn to draw their faces AND their clothes in one go. Um honestly I think I gave myself a mild concussion a few days back bc ever since then I get nauseous if I’m on the computer for more than like 20 mins at a time (and I was powering through thinking it was just normal not feeling good but it’s..been consistent).

I wanna finish them .. what is time . TT A TT 50% ALREADY!! Wow!! Thank you!!
I took a break from obsessively checking to sort some more stuffed animals to donate so I feel like I'm being rewarded for my good deeds haha https:// twitter.com/cambrasine/sta tus/1162137320583311361   …. <3 <3 Thank you! GOOD LUCK AT FLAMECON BTW!! Having trouble letting go of this one..maybe she stays this round.. pic.twitter.com/dgE7YTv4Cf. took my entire life but !! packed up 2 boxes of stuffed animals to go to new homes!! One is headed to a hospital, the other to a place that helps families keep their pets (+also generally assists them)!

If you've got new or gently used plush check out http:// stuffedanimalsforemergencies.org /  . also PHEW!! between ebay and art and donations i've been packing stuff up most days this week! hopefully taking tomorrow off from packing + kickstarter agonizing , will resume saturday lmfao. Yes!! So many places won’t accept stuffed animals at all, and a lot that do won’t take them unless they’re brand new, so I was really happy to find this place! . AGSBDJDBF THANK U JESS omg I never see your name written in full so it didn’t occur to me that it was you!! thank you . If anyone wants to know if we ate it and if so if it was poisoned - my mom tried a sliver and didn’t like how it tasted anyway, then I tried a piece and she decided it was bad and also maybe poisoned and threw it out..to be fair it was kind of bad..and maybe poisoned . Realistically it’s unlikely it was tampered w but hey you never know people do crazy shit like put needles in strawberries or whatever and she decided it’s not worth dying over a cupcake, especially not a bad one . Sounds fake but ok 
Can’t believe being on the priority shortlist means still like four fucking weeks apparently!! Almost two months since we were first in touch!! This school!! Sucks! pic.twitter.com/33EKxtuj33. Family is wild,, why does “getting along” to some people mean biting your tongue and being insulted . Yes holy shit from time to time I wonder if that’s irreparable damage I did ..glad to hear it’s not just me. If anyone who’s been following this wants to place bets please play

By the end of the day I’ll have received...

(Also secret option #4 is I call the school+ask for the ladies I’ve been working with and they go .... and I go what and they go she stopped working here in 1993). Oof ok who wants to give me $450 a month for the next 10 months...any takers?! . Two consecutive emails from my school:
> $4000 please :)
> “Taking a look at poverty”. Oh Kickstarter~~ you’re sooo naughty~~

No but seriously..thank y’all so much..in this moment I’m feeling very beaten down by life stuffs but this is very lovely.. pic.twitter.com/NVQ1zbpMp6.  thank you zambi!!! I’m gonna be annoying about the KS for a few day but I’ll post less frequently after that!!....but still some ...you can always mute the words if it gets annoying .

Oof I had this problem at AX I took small ones without service and was lucky they went through but it’s a nightmare. Omg that’s so adorable I hope their words come true. He’s been kidnapped   I’m sorry this happened ugh. MY FRIEND. @ beccabeearts  just made a super cool holo print of the faeries!! Going through the last of my giant clothing pile.. When I was 14 this dress went to my knees..now it’s a bodycon dress with a possible panty shot situation   it’s woven so..with leggings in winter I think I can pull it off pic.twitter.com/FU3DaVNQ4x. RIGHT...casually slides back into my closet. Thank you   Yeah I’m gonna...hold onto it . Big mood. At momocon I had deku stolen off my table TWICE !!! Why is this Burger King always playing a show about serial killers it’s so stressful dndndk. Also I get Burger King by necessity a lot during school and I’ve been craving since May don’t judge me for travelling 20 mins for this. Hnn their original chicken sandwich..they also have I would argue the best fries of the three big fast food chains though I know that may be a controversial opinion .

This is the best picture of me ever taken. lrt woah that looks fun!! omg nooo bakugou is a good boy who wouldn't risk anything that'd go on his record and hinder him from becoming the no. 1 hero!!! ....except yknow the ...................whole bullying thing....ANYWAY

Glad to hear it's going well and you're getting the appreciation you deserve!! yesss!! comparing numbers to previous years (with steady  cons) is sooo so gratifying!!  feels like tangible proof of growth (and yknow, , money's nice too LMFAO). wehhh wish I was at flamecon w cash to burn bc I got into good omens right after AX and therefore have No merch/prints!!! i've seen so many cute GO cosplayer photos from it too! NEXT TIME WE MEET.............. I THROW MONEY AT U AND TAKE THINGS. LRT I DONT SMOKE BUT I WANT HIMMMMM. dsfgfh was trying to remember where I got good japanese food to potentially go there tomorrow and looking it up made me. so hungry ohmtgofdgfdsgdfg. someone wanna do me a solid and tell me how old nezuko is? or like,... was when she was turned into a demon? I don't think I could check without potentially seeing major spoilers. heroes rising US release date when. thank you!!! <3. Drawing on lined paper like I’m back in high school ?? pic.twitter.com/nNTR4l0Tog. Also do you love how I didn’t draw kny fan art for months while watching and now suddenly I’m GOING FOR IT. Had a dream.remember those pop up restaurants where everyone dined in the nude? Crowley + Azi dinner date: Crow shows up, says some cool line, popping open a bottle of whatever —then he actually looks -sees Azi naked- his mouth gapes in shock, alcohol pours back out his mouth. Here’s a random smattering from my brain and recently liked posts @/gicatam @/ginkohs @/littlethunderr @/pepperonccini @/sarakipin. Finally out hooks on the other side of my bookcase so I could hang my other ita bag up! ..and banana boys pic.twitter.com/v4QjUx3RYy. i think i missed kiribaku day........ :(
I have sooo many things I wanna draw but I'm really slow!! mom: who wants to help me shake the spray paint?~
me: oooh I'm kinda busy drawing bakugou and kirishima as rabbits so---. slime peeps!! gonna try to get those out for tomorrow !! scream I forgot I left another bag of stuffed animals to be donated in the storage unit.. rip. SO I'VE HEARD/SEEN (eyes emoji). related note: if anyone can remember the username of the person who draws all the bnha characters as bunnies.. i immediately lost the insta post and i can't remember!! https:// twitter.com/cambrasine/sta tus/1163183423164469248   …. THIS IS SO FUNNY CAUSE LITERALLY EARLIER TODAY I WAS THINKING THEY WERE LIKE YOU bUT WITH BUNS. i wanna dye my hair like three different colors send help. fdsgdh I want like this whole spectrum somehow pic.twitter.com/50hJxuaUk7. UH.T..THESE ONES pic.twitter.com/Q0mbxN1vSj. HONESTLY,,,
I just can't decide.......... like I know I like purple and i'm worried what will happen if I try to gradient it to blue or pink ;;. Oof that’s what I’ve heard that blue is hard to get rid of! Never tried it myself. And I haven’t tried pink either but when this lady decided to dye my hair red for some reason that shit STUCK. And dark purple goes magenta..The only color that’s faded well for me is pastel purple. BDNDHSB LIKE THAT NEWBIE WHO DYED MY HAIR NAVY INSTEAD OF LIGHT PURPLE Ohmygod yeah we somehow got it back to dark brown to dark purple but it was a task. Wanna make good omens and or kny merch but there’s so much already and I don’t have any interesting ideas yet :(. Wish me luck that my advisor replies tomorrow and also says I’m good to go bc sometimes she just Doesn’t Reply to me as if that’s not her exact job. Aside from doing preorders I know some ppl sell different forms of their work that are easily reproduced. Depends what it is but like postcards/prints of photos of their work..maybe you could do a fashion shoot? Or just more charms/stickers of your patch designs? Hnn it’s tricky. Also its expensive and takes away from the handmade aspect but I know some embroidery/plush artists have taken their most popular designs to be manufactured instead so they don’t have to make the same thing their entire lives but people can still buy it. Cady is sicky :( she had like a couple little incidents but bounced back but now tummy troubles again..will take her to the vet tomorrow.. Oh yeah she is sicky ... You’ve heard of the floor is Lava now get ready for the floor is towels pic.twitter.com/ZFkEHFjnmt. Tw vomit /
Ugh yikes my mom told me to leave when she started puking bc I started gagging.. don’t want to overreact by taking her to the 24 hour vet bc they were awful there when we went with our last dog but feel bad she’s so drooly and pukey and uhh ..the other end too.. This is so spooky. Yeah I looked up like when should I be worried and her gums look fine, there’s no blood in anything, etc. .. probably just tummy trouble from dietary indiscretion.. keeping a close eye on her! Thank you! . It’s a good tweet sunny. Taking cady to the doctor today and hopefully myself tomorrow or smth bc at this point I’m pretty sure I did give myself a mild concussion and i can’t deal w the nausea that happens randomly and from scrolling and shit nfnfjf. Lrt yeah doesn’t matter if you’re careful with your money if you still don’t have enough of it to cover your basic needs / or scrape by but get completely decimated the second there’s an unexpected expense or emergency. Lmfao doing good over here brought a bucket in case either of us pukes . That was. The grossest vet visit. Hopefully these meds help. Ok on last week tonight it was pointed out that people used to call their period “the curse” and I think we should bring that back it sounds spooky. my birthday was in may and i haven't been able to go to the doctor since bc the lady didn't have an appointment until december??? and they wont even let a nurse or anyone see me they're just like 'welp guess you have to go to urgent care'
this system is so broken. switched doctors bc what the fuck use is a doctor you can't see for 3/4 of a year at a time
going tomorrow but the nurse was like um sounds like u had a concussion so. w..hoops
I feel pretty bad I  should've babied myself more the first few days but i didn't like a fool. If I do too many packages at once I have an existential crisis. Hi!! I’m not much of a gamer but I was playing life is strange with someone I’m not currently hanging with so — does anyone know any streamers or youtubers you like who play it? . Aaa I will check him out!! Thank you!! Bob’s Famous Saint Beef.. Bob’s Famous Street Beef ... Bob’s Famous Star Trek Beef —— pic.twitter.com/X0xxqjSKRy. It’s roast beef I was just playing around~~ out of the options presented tho street beef sounds pretty rad. woof pic.twitter.com/RJ9I7s2IkJ. THIS IS SO PRECIOUS. Cady hasn’t expelled anything gross since this morning, napped a lot, had the first two doses of her meds, drank water and managed a couple bites of food...hopefully she’ll bounce back within a few days :O. I’ll look into it!! Thank you!! . Thank you for blessing my timeline. (Ps also just generally enjoying you learning embroidery!! Good work!!!). Update!! We are one fanny pack pledge away from being funded!! IM NOT CRYING YOURE CRYING  https:// twitter.com/cambrasine/sta tus/1162137320583311361   …. Crowley invented Plaster Fun Time’s glitter glaze option, pass it on pic.twitter.com/YQEyDRSLIJ. YOURE NOT WRONG omg. New old friend!!!  their tongue poking out is super cute !! I look tired zzz bed time.... pic.twitter.com/LdqtTocWRv. Had a dream the scoop troop was hanging in my neighborhood but I was still too much older than them. I hoped Steve would notice my tattoo of some thing they were into and invite me and Cady to hang e the crew. Uh yeah so I had concussion. And I didn’t rest as much as I should’ve because I convinced myself I didn’t have one bc it shouldn’t have been such a hard hit. Oops... I did ok on the neurological test but I got a bit dizzy and headache got worse after . Wheeze it’s my fault, I just like..it didn’t seem like I should’ve been able to give myself one so easily and I get migraines so it took a while to be sure from the other symptoms and stuff orz I’ll try to rest more! It’s hard to do nothing yknow. I think the stress of knowing my brain hit my skull and that I might be nauseous and more prone to migraines than I already normally am is making me feel worse. She replied today and seemed like she’s not gonna let me take the class I want but she CC’d a prof I had last semester who is chair of the dept who liked me so we’ll see what she says..she’ll know better if I’m ready for it or not than this random lady . Tw vomit

Cady has only eaten pill pockets and like literally two bites of food so we’re trying rice and chicken.. I can understand her not wanting her dog food right away when she threw it up.. Thankfully she ate it right up! Just giving her a little at a time. I’d be so worried if she hadn’t.. but thank you, that’s a good tip! Thank you for the well wishes!! Pupdate she is very happy w that and overall seems more herself today, no noticeable side effects from her meds either . my advisor: you're a sophormore the one you want is usually a junior class, you should take something else you haven't taken instead - like junior studio
junior studio description: to be taken in second semester of junior year
me: ????????????????????????? FULLY FUNDED! THANK YOU SO MUCH! I was worried this was too ambitious, I am so pleasantly surprised by the support!

I'm considering *small* stretch goals such as adding a sticker/charm to each tier or patches! Backers prefs hold more weight, but feel free to leave ur thoughts! https:// twitter.com/cambrasine/sta tus/1162137320583311361   …. THANK YOU IM STILL SCARED SOMEHOW LMFAO. ASBDNDISNFLD omg that would be so savage you should 
(Also I haven’t watched it in forever but I remember baby me enjoying that movie a lot ). Eeep I’m sorry this is happening to y’all again..it’s getting very popular here... Bout to donate all these clothes bc I was cursed with good friends with tiny moms who think I’m as small as them but I’m Not pic.twitter.com/l44785oimM. Also if you’re like Jenn is that a fleece long sleeve top and pants with  penguins on them even tho it was 92 today the answer is yeah. ABSBSJDND THANK U AMET you’re too kind . THANK YOU HARU . THANK YOU DANI . Lmfaoo I put the rest of the chicken and rice on her dog food and I can hear the PING of her spitting the dog food back out as she eats . (Softly) does the password to even view the AX @AnimeExpo  artist alley sign up page not work til tomorrow or am I doing something wrong. LRT LEST???? Just FYI I love Spider-Man and I haven’t tweeted bc I’m confused and maybe also in denial. Only for people who were in last year. They reserve a limited number of tables for that then the rest are released later. Oof yeah I’m trying to remember how the normal app was last year and I’m ??? Trying not to feel guilty about napping and sleeping late cause my brain needs it . My concussion info paper says you’re not supposed to do anything that gets your heart rate up to 70% of the maximum does that include artist alley sign ups. Promptly vomits pic.twitter.com/otMXi7f7sz. legit gonna go lay down i'm so nauseous my heart is beaitng so gfdfast. Hndndndnd trying to chill but the workers started back up on the field and now the house is jiggling. The latter. ............SEVEN YEARS??????????/. That genuinely sounds more relaxed and better for my body than the current system. Found the most precious shoes while dropping off some donations   I had to practically curl my foot to get them on so they won’t be coming home w me but if you’re like a 6.5 and near the Savers in Marlboro MA then run pic.twitter.com/KYgO54Cv7e. I didn’t come here to shop but shit she was 99 cents pic.twitter.com/qcVZHl8UEw. RIP us :(. They’re so beauty . Aaaa I should’ve bought them and sold them to someone instead of making y’all cry. Omg that’s so rough   it can be hard to find things in bigger sizes too. I didn’t even process it but you’re right they look untouched . ASMDNFIND D O H MY GOD!!!! You lucky duck ! :o.  that’s sooo cute!! Enjoy them!!! I didn’t check the actually size but I’m usually a 7-7.5 and it was labeled that on the tag and it was too tight for me so that was my guess . I have like,,, 1000 questions abt this. Lrt uh why is momo there instead of tsuyu........? Yknow, the one who’s actually in this arc? Lmfaoo. Every time I stop to think about the date I freak out please I want to swim forever school never stop stop stoooooppppp. IM NOT JOKING MY EYES STARTED LEAKING AS I WROTE THIS hnnnnfjdnfndj. Honestly. I still don’t have my classes and school starts in two weeks . The trial set of Kickstarter exclusive charms from Kayla’s Art Mart arrived today!  

You can grab some for yourself at  http:// kck.st/2MjUmtj    ! pic.twitter.com/Dr3Zhi1Atu. Dhdndjsj watched part of life is strange 2 ep 4 and it’s so heartbreaking 
Also the person I watched made such wild choices so dissimilar from me so I can’t wait for the ALL OPTIONS compilation videos. There’s a few doctors at our vet office and the lady is like. So...is blunt even the right word?
She’s the one that completely unprompted told us Cady “has a small vagina” one time and this past time she was like “this is the same medicine I was on for my UTI” . she's a lot. i'm literally four people in talking to the school trying to find out if i can take this one class. Hmm yeah it’s just the class is about working in the field and your portfolio and agents and all that shit so it seemed like a good one in case I peace out of school . Honestly the stress of all this back and forth with the school  for MONTHS is making me feel even worse and now it’s like if NONE of the classes I want to take are even going to work then I don’t even wanna fucking go here anymore cause they won’t LET me go less than half time -. and I don’t want to have to pay like $5000 and take a bunch of classes before I can unlock classes that are relevant and going to help me grow or learn - but TA is not worth 1.5 credits so I’m back to doing at least 3 classes and I have a couple cons and to go to Oregon for my. brothers defense So I didn’t want to do all of that!! And I had to decide to TA before I could get anything else ironed out bc everyone’s so slow so now I can’t *not* go at all I *have* to take all those irrelevant classes for thousands of dollars this thing is so fucking fucked. Sorry I’m just feeling so physically shit on and off from the concussion and I’m trying to rest more and relax and enjoy the last of summer but I’m doing all this shit w school getting stressed instead bc I’ve got two weeks to figure this all out and ugh ugh uGH. Bless the illustration head she wrote back even tho she’s on vaycay til Monday and gave me her blessing. Now the only problem is in the weeks I’ve been trying to get into this class the open spot filled, then it was 1 over, then there was an opening, and now back to closed . Oh surprise the prof wrote back too suddenly and said nice things and approved 

Damn if only I’d waited a couple hours to have my mental breakdown earlier. had not heard of this before your tweet but yeah seems like wearing some parts of a fursuit but showing your skin so you can tell it's a human person kinda like that haircut they give to poodles sometimes. Ok this is going to make me sound like a 7 year old in 1985 but it’s hard finding a shelf unit or bookcase that will properly display both my small my little ponies and my 2 big Care Bears plushes. These are ALL so precious but what really got me was Nezuko’s little leggy!!!! . AAA I USUALLY WATCH ANIME W LUNCH SO I FORGOT GIVENS TODAY (it comes out too late for lunch!!). I'm not a very analytical reader/watcher but I'm enjoying watching it!!  Some comedy, drama, lots of feels, and  jams!! LRT IVE BEEN ATTACKEDDD. i wanna draw aaa but i actually have plans to go on a day trip tomorrow and enjoy life so!! should go to bed.............. lrt imagine this as a screen print /drools. so vibrant and full of energy!!! thank you, i'll be here all week

Me, shaking Horikoshi down: YES HELLO I WAS PROMISED SOME KIDS THIS WEEK??? To be fair I think it said what are the heroes up to and there was technically one hero 
It’s been interesting but,,, my kids,, my children,,, idk where they are. Advisor: I’ve cleared you to take the class!
System: class is full, join waitlist?
Me: yeah
System: you have not been cleared to——. There’s one ring of my grandmothers I am absolutely in love with and it very tragically fits on exactly none of my fingers (too big AND too small!!). It’s like. A little mountain. Or maybe a gourd.. pic.twitter.com/soSzFA4yIG. Yeah, just feel like I’ll probably grow sometime so I should wait . Yeah, it’s super unique! Hard to imagine my grandma wearing it, no offense grandma . Oh!! That’s all good info, thank you   I would like to be able to wear it without worrying about losing it or getting it off haha. I GOT SO EXCITED I FOUND SMTH UNEXPECTED I’m gonna save for @grimmfirefly  ‘s bday but also she may already have them so it’s a mystery and we may both have to wait three months to be severely disappointed ! White guy next to us at dinner: what’s this? Korean? Thai? 
Waiter: It’s a Japanese restaurant..
White guy: ..so do you have scallion pancakes or? Dirty mirror pics only but I call this look “peacock meets Jennifer Aniston circa Friends” pic.twitter.com/3WnYmn4P0u. My room, my mirrors, my life - a mess. “Oh you can see the bed rest ..rest bed...bed head...HEAD BOARD!”. I’m not feeling nauseous as frequently now which is really good cause that was awful but I’m struggling with some vocabulary . There are two wolves inside of me: one loves fashion and the other howls incessantly unless I wear pants with an elastic waistband. Absbshshbs damn this GOT ME!!!  beautiful executed idea!!
..The button tradition is too fucking precious too. hi
sometimes you just have to restart a drawing from scratch 
and that's ok. re: this

(character belongs to the lovely paige.draws on insta!!) pic.twitter.com/IfVW4nrzSL. I have no training or skill for this but someone .. wood block prints for KnY would b very aesthetic. If I spend more than 30 seconds in direct sunlight I get totally toasted
Like I’ll feel ok but without fail I’ll be flush-faced and woozy that evening. Oof did the thing where my head hurt so badly last night I couldn’t focus, finally took meds before bed..so when I woke up without the migraine+could focus on Anything Else again my body was like food..water so I put a lot of both in my stomach at once and my stomach is like wHY. Me: I’m dehydrated 
Me: (drinks no less than four cups of water all at once). Why do I think characters + braces is so cute??? I think it’s probably hard for a lot of people to draw tho cause a lot of artists don’t go into detail on teeth.. broke: using only a lined or lineless style
woke: doing whatever the fuck you have to to make your drawing readable. So cool outside today!! Thought about biking but when I tried to consult my mom about it and explain that the concussion packet said explicitly not to I got stuck on my words again so maybe not yet djddndn time for storage unit part 1274930 -this one is mostly my grandmas stuff. we were just going through the last storage unit today (still lots to do unfortunately) my mom is trying to convince me we still have my pochacco backpack and i am losing hope. aa thank you!! it's super cute so I hope so too!! I remember I used to keep my rollerblades in there..ah the 90's LMFAO pic.twitter.com/7Deff3ONCa. Same but 10 and 1:00 . Me during the day: wow!! Nice and cool!! Do stuff outside!!
Me at night: .......(turns on heated seat). LMfaoo My mom is watch life is strange playthrough with me and I told her “things are going to go bad, that’s how the game works” . # dtiys  for paige.draws on instagram!!
I started over but it was totally worth it!
her oc is so cute, I had a lot of fun with her clips!!  pic.twitter.com/WZGuca3u7F. anyway if u need a new bop and the video is just as fun!! https://www. youtube.com/watch?v=DSoqC6 ERnYA   …. I wonder if I should get a note for school ..my vision started blurring out when I was just adjusting that drawing at the end . She cuddle pic.twitter.com/x1HV8qT039. ok just one class left to pick..time to play 2 hours a week writing/reading/lecture and bullshit or 5 hours a week +drawing .......hhhh.  thank you!! I had a lot of fun with it! Visible women day and I’m out here like have I drawn anything of value since last whatever artist meme . Kirishima is my best boy but if you’ve drawn him too much then maybe Shion from No.6 or ichigo from Tokyo mew mew? . Aaa I have some preferences already but I’m excited to meet more characters and figure out my fave(s) (in KnY). The rule I’ve been operating under is if I can get it closed and I love it: it can stay - even if I can’t bend or breathe or perform organ function - bc /maybe/ it’ll fit sometime —- but if I can’t even close it then it’s gotta go pic.twitter.com/lpgm6qXCnP. Aaa yay! He’s such a sweetie pie! lrt omg i wonder how the english dub will treat camie .. i've only watched a little of it but i'm curious. Uh hi honey pic.twitter.com/5Ij4mscYY2. Dewclaw is a b**** pic.twitter.com/iSsHgzPILB. Hallelujah!! Y’all I’m gonna try to wear real clothes this semester!!! Like not leggings/sweats and a graphic tee every single time !! Like fuck it wear what you want but I have a lot of cute clothes that need to see the light of day and being a TA maybe I should pretend I dress like an adult. wahh I moved everything on the stairs and cady is STILL freaked out and looking over there and won't cross through into the kitchen...literally nothing happened u foolish little dog. Me: How old is this kid - 15?!
Mom: Born..2001
Me: AAAAAAAA
Mom: but he’s /eighteen/
Me: STOP NOT A SINGLE PERSON WAS BORN AFTER 1999. Lrt I was really happy to learn Ash was bi!!! Bicon!! u sure as heck galaxy brained that was BRILLIANT!! Lmfaoo I’m so weak my prof was like you’ll have to go get cords and stuff and I got a stomach ache thinking about dealing with the people at lock up who have historically been Not Nice. MANLY COLORS ONLY: dark blue, black, and charcoal gray. I wish this tweet was a joke. My momma spray painted my some stuff green for me aaaa theyre so pretty! my headboard and jewelry display I used to use for shows and am now going to use for my stuff!! Much excite . Inosuke - but playing Twister. Follow your dreams, friend. wheeze I waited too long to buy promare tix and all the good seats are taken in boston :( it's less convenient than other theaters but ...... more fun / meet up w people i feel like. my hot take is that he'd pull a harry potter and insist on being a Gryffindor regardless oh how he was going to be sorted bc that was All Might's house. honestly tho this is hard cause i feel like most people would say slytherin but he jumps to action like gryffindor, but is a clever little shit like ravenclaw... hi my friend's doing me a sold go buy our shit
 https:// egl.circlly.com/users/grimmfir efly   … pic.twitter.com/E31yWI6FgS. *solid  :|. why do i suddenly have ideas to draw now that i am heading back to hell (school). drew animals and forgot the tails (looks into camera). all I have to say for my file naming system is my brain is predictable across time

me: i have too many kiribaku files...maybe I named it fashion
file name: fashionboys.png

me: wasn't it like.. lesbians??
file name: galpals.psd. au where i finish these charms theyre p cute. this made me tear up a little........definitely can be interpreted in other ways but in any case really effective <3. someone pinch me every time i forget tanjiro's earrings in a sketch it's the only way i will learn. Uh ok I tried to exhaust myself today so I’d go to bed early?? I rode my bike, I kayaked, I swam, I moved furniture and boxes at the storage unit and I’m out here at 3 AM FULL OF ENERGYYYYYYY. Sending love and good vibes to you and your pup!!! Even though it’s scary I’m sure you did the right thing by getting them the help they need — and you can spoil them as soon as they’re out!! Omg these are soo precious . pic.twitter.com/eOy0EdP1mK. SOOONCUTTTEEE. Datemate sounds so cute omg. Sometimes u gotta question how people’s brains work..this seems so straightforward ........ Just trying to picture how they’d possibly justify it . hnn ebay keeps giving me coupons for everything but the one thing I could be convinced to buy......... Almost forgot to post!

A silly doodle of kiribaku as buns for brabbitwdl16 on instagram's contest! It's still going if you want an excuse to draw mha bunnies!!! pic.twitter.com/7HzaZKUML6. **Used a very cute reference photo that I think it would be impossible to source. KIRISHIMA IS TOO STRONK the whole fucking hook fell off  pic.twitter.com/caEne5gauh. just experienced the first bid war since I started selling shit on ebay again...thank u random citizens for the dolalrs. i tried to nap away my headache but it did Not work. Me drawing zenitsu’s hair without reference: “this is probably fine..”. How do y’all draw your sets? Usually I sketch them all the complete them each one by one but this time I’ve been jumping around working on each and it’s very weird. been drawing lineless so much lately but kny makes u wanna really lean into the chonky line art. I sat on my butt and drew instead of being helpful tonight but look my mom found this while going thru boxes from my grandmas house  pic.twitter.com/Y61ZMVQqaZ. Preview :p (do not RT) pic.twitter.com/flNHVFkTzz. agsbdjdb thank u I lov him . If I stop to think for 5 seconds I get super stressed out bc summer is ending and I’ve only been to the beach once, school starts in less than a week, there’s stuff EVERYWHERE from storage, and my ex bff wants to hang this weekend after like 6 years . Aha I get migraines so I’m kinda used to it but it’s in a different part of my head than usual so it threw me. Pain meds and water did take the edge off tho, thank you!! Very valid. Ahah no way I totally have art like this too copying Mermaid Melody panels and stuff . The number of times people have bought something from me on Etsy or eBay “by mistake” is astronomical   I just can’t even imagine how?? pic.twitter.com/xcSCR1SM3s. Wheeze yeah that’s what I’m doing rn cause I struggle w that too.  sleepy time charms are so cute, I’ve never done them before tho so this was my chance haha. Aaa thank u friend !! Gonna have a little update for y’all later today or tomorrow with something new~  https:// twitter.com/cambrasine/sta tus/1162137320583311361   …. Good luck!! Lmfao usually when I say where I live people don’t say shit and don’t know where it is but this lady was like THEY HAVE THE BEST BONSAI STORE and it was very unexpected —. Aww this is all so sweet!! Oh shit I’ve never read nana but look at all these at savers.. pic.twitter.com/01qmPn9k1F. DSGFDH what the fuck it's my ex's little sisters senior year?! literally how
....meanwhile we fell behind LMFAOO.. gotta do what you gotta do. yikes.. i'm sorry this is happening to ya..probably a good idea, you don't deserve that shit!! i have this no interest credit card so I can yknow not have interest and pay off stuff slowly but i'm always super compelled to pay it off completely cause I hate having a balance but I should..restrain myself..probably. hello i'm the queen of waiting until the last day to decide if i'm going to a con that's more than 6 hours drive away. should i go to y*umacon now that my bro isn't defending his thesis in october??????? scream the artist alley survey is great and also the worst bc i'll try to look up a con and someone will be like I MADE $50 and someone else will be like I MADE $8000 and i just ------. living the dream. OH NO that’s so miserable.. Update deku fell a few hours later?! I donut understand why these command strips both failed so suddenly?! The temperature and humidity didn’t change so??? pic.twitter.com/vJCRVG4Dz4. NICOLE THIS IS SO SOFT MY HEART CAnT TAKE iT DNdnfndmnfn. they cannot be contained LMFAOO. omg this person's insane this airbnb is like NO CHILDREN NO BABIES NO TEENS (UNDER 16) like what is going on w u ................ THIS LOOKS SO GOOOOD ..fashion..and so clean.. wow!! Love how I just get nightmares for like a week and a half straight before the semester starts . Omg
When this happens to me I’ll just like. Run. suddenly. And get winded pretty immediately bc I don’t /like running/ and that usually helps   punching bag sounds more fun tho!! HONESTLY HE’S NOT WRONG. Omg There’s a thread saying Inosuke and Bakugou aren’t similar - and even tho I don’t have all the info yet -  I agree, they’re definitely not - but omg the replies is like a trash Bakugou fest it’s very sad I love them both . Also the people who haven’t read the manga like hey give him a minute he has his moments!!!! I think if you don’t pay attention to them, you may miss them ?   either way another classic case of if u don’t like something good for u shut up and let ppl enjoy things . Yeah :( just like with people you don’t have to put down one character to lift another up! ..or as my grandma would say “that’s why they make chocolate and vanilla” . People are particularly stoked on demon slayer you should watch it!! And then let me throw the merch I’m working on@u . I found a cute bench but it’s $15 over the max budget I set RIP. WHY IS THIS A THING.....yikes. My brain: ear plugs 
My brain: ...wait. Shsbhdhs omg yes! I’m imagining my indecisive self trying to choose between things then ADD BALOON POPPING . Cons are already so over stimulating who approved this . M * r der ???? Lrt also tell that to my town who allows construction to occur 12 hours a day 7 days a week. Lrt me me me me me me me me. [RTs  ] Just about a week and a half to go! 

You can now grab a super cute iron on patch by @Giraffewiz  through my fanny pack Kickstarter! Roughly 2.5" in size to fit on the front pocket - or any jacket, bag, etc. for extra cuteness!

Available online@ http:// cambrasine.art/shop-all    + at #ladiescon  and probably #miceexpo  this Fall! pic.twitter.com/Sj1PqS5FcX. dsfGFHFDGH i'm screaming AA survey data really is a nightmare this person said they made $100 at a big con AND that it was better than the previous year HOWEVER it ALSo says they ARE LOCAL -- AND ALSO that they're travel expenses were $700-1,000 ??????this is such chaos. IT IS VERY USELESS TO ME AND ALSO I HOPE THEYRE OK. “OH! Oh.” - the sound of me getting a waitlist update email from an*yc, only to then actually read it and see that nope still nothing. me trying to decide on y*umacon
brain: you have school
also brain: u could finish those halloween charms you abandoned last year. idk what even happened today how is it late. Same. I’m crying ..so THIS is how he got that name huh . aaaa Thank you paige!!! <3 <3 <3. honestly,,,, these charms are fucking adorable , *I* want them ok????????? LMFAOO I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE ORIGIN POINT OF YOUR JOKEabdbjshdnsnd. I think it's just supposed to be like buff All Might's cartoony face but yes omg it's so disturbing. aaa I'm glad it all arrived safely!! Enjoy and thank you again for your patience!! .  !! Thank you!! . i'm glad someone is enjoying it . i've never made wooden charms before..........................i wonder..............................if these would look good on wood..........they're more expensive but if preorders go well then????;;. dfsdrfhfth what the fuck..hope y'all are okay..sending my love!!! <3 <3 <3. hey y'all anyone ordered from zap recently? I haven't in a long time but the last times I feel like there was a longer turnaround time than stated..wondering if they did anything abt that... ugh straight pride parade in my blue-ass state..y'all are fucking exhausting. just wanna say I love InkItLabs ok. I've only ordered a couple times but they have a ton of amazing options for acrylic+wood - and secret options too. quick + helpful customer service. the quality is amazing and worth the higher price tag if you can afford it. plus cool collabs! i was considering a place I had bad experiences with then saw some recent bad reviews and before my friend reminded me of in*kit and they replied to my questions so quickly I am just overwhelmed with affection rn for avoiding dealing w z*p LMFAO. Oh no   I hope it gets better for y’all . That’d make a good bio tbh..or dating app bio . Omg I had some display revelation and drew it out so I wouldn’t forget and apparently I chomped (cut) that part of my sketchbook out SCREAM. fdgdfh of the new ones i p much only know rengoku's name...and it's bc half my TL is hot for him. I THINK /WOOD/ CHARMS.../WOULD/ BE COOL so I'm getting a sample :3 c means I have to wait longer to show y'all the finished designs but i'm not fucking around yknow!! one day I will go to y*umacon but that day is not...this year...

did some math costs for pet care, table, gas+lodging or flight, lodging alone without stock..and I'd have to skip two classes + increased anxiety...not sure it's worth it ..holding out hope for aa/c and a/nyc . dfgdfhfgh I FEEL THAT.. I saw like 3 pretty big spoilers already..rIPpy. dfgdfg yeah i'm not sure ..AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS A TYPO but then the rest of their response made it absolute chaos. TT A TT sorry friend!! I really want to go to but it's a bit risky and I know mid-semester me will be regretting it!! I'll try again next year   thank you for the well wishes! sample ordered . I want to eat this whole cake. Hn yeah you’re right.. like I skipped a similarly far but smaller one this month and I was really glad bc I feel like I didn’t have enough time as it is to do everything I wanted before school . They’re both lovely but B is definitely clearer to see and I always like that. Hi I’m in major denial that it is currently September because it isn’t please join me on this wonderous journey.  Halloween is great and I’m happy for y’all but so is ...swimming ..and no school pic.twitter.com/PCsYKdfVsF. SJENDJDJDND I SQUEAKED this is so great. Omg GOOD LUCK!! I hope you have a good experience there!! Omg I love him. Got in bed so early but my head was hurting really badly again and I couldn’t find my medicine so I took a different one than usual and I’m just being paranoid abt side effects like a fool. Ok I talked to my prof I did my adulting for the day. People who are “ready” to go back to school? How???? Tell me your secrets???????????? Lmfaoo we were cleaning the house yesterday before my friend came over and my mom deadass removed the coat rack?? like wait that wasn’t the problem it’s these 59373639 cardboard boxes!! . Hey
Sometimes don’t you just feel like sitting on the floor. Baby... It got sunny outside but she’s napping and I also made the mistake of sitting down w her pic.twitter.com/ndBrBczhcb. really dont' know how to draw nezuko's hair in bulk. lmfaoo no for real i think i'm gonna redo her hair it's Not working. anyway the temperature has dropped below 65 and so my body is switching to hibernation mode. LRT gorgeous drawing but also LMFAOO WISH THATS WHAT THE WATER WAS LIKE HERE. spotify has played me like 6 meat bar ads literally why. dsgfhfkghjsdgfdknbfghgdfcgvhbjnksmlf,sdghfnvcbxc. cade is so funny?? when we have a guest even if i'm between her and them she won't cuddle at all - like yesterday - and now today this is the second time she's kept scooted til we're touching . DSFGDFH MY STOMACH GRUMBLED AND SHE RECOILED SO STRONGLY then got up and left </3. Someone out there has probably made a really depressing Given fanmix. hi definitely not asking for a reason do u sway when u are just standing still? Had a dream I won two Instagram giveaways but had turned off notifications so I ran out of the clock on both of them. AJ. Haircut...it’d been a while   first class TOMORROW pic.twitter.com/7enz3NTNqm. Gonna do purple overtone before Monday I think!! I’ve been storing it through the summer haha. Lmfaoo Kenma is a cutie but that’s not my look   Yeah rn my blonde ranges from platinum to golden so it’s kind of a nightmare bc the pastel won’t cover the darker blondes but I’m gonna try mixing w vibrant purple then blending to pastel so we’ll see what happens . (I think 10x10 May be the same as AB vendor booths and I’ve seen like three artists share one of those!! Don’t quote me on that tho!!). I packed my school bag.. pic.twitter.com/pxIQC01N4e.  the place we donated most of the stuffed animals to sent such a lovely thank you!! I teared up a bit

If you have new or gently used stuffed animals to donate please check out  https:// stuffedanimalsforemergencies.org/urgent-needs   

Also lmfao “ cambrasine  family” bc my return address label    pic.twitter.com/5wMQT9NdEA. this grading scale seems kind of intense????? isn't a C kind of rough for 'did the thing'............. pic.twitter.com/GRhDymEzev. if u want someone to do more then?? ask them to do more/?????????? hnn I guess just them wording it differently than usual hit me different...but yeah it still seems pretty harsh overall.....I'm definitely more of an overachiever but this got me nervous dfgfdh. i want to get married at crane estate!!!
i don't have
yknow
someone to marry but
yknow. that's one of my bougier tweets but i don't need the whole damn mansion I just want like the lawn so you can walk through the woods to the beach..........i'd get married in the woods but i think it'd probably be distracting if everyone was swatting at mosquitos. yess! also it took me some tries to mail them most efficiently ($ wise) mailing pro tips: parcel post exists, most US*PS services go by zone now (nearer = cheaper), if small+heavy flat rate is your friend, and if you have a lot keep box dimensions under 12" to avoid paying more! @ TeamCoco  pssst -- is it possible to get the name of the artist who did the illustration at the end of the credits (of Greenland made out the native animals)? . today i learned of a local business that brings goats to your property to eat brush and poison ivy. casually avoids going to bed cause I know I won't sleep tonight u vu. ACK this lady and I have the exact same measurements quick give me $200 for a cosplay LMFAOO. THE LATEST EP OF MIRACULOUS WAS CUTE I WANNA DRAW THEM SO MUCH GAHHHH school,,,,,,,,,,,, can u wait like 1 week or forever. Glad my doc gave my nausea meds so I could misplace them and still be nauseas   I seriously can’t find them for over a week now. You’ve heard of school getting cancelled for /bad/ weather —- now get ready for school getting cancelled for /good/ weather

If it qualifies as “beach weather” school shouldn’t happen . Hot take  . Uh this classroom is dark locked and empty send help. Update I talked the people outside and we all went in lmfao. i don't wanna go to school when it's nice outside

also the rest of the time. uh the syllabus for this class is like purchase a domain name and site via squarespace but i already pay for a domain and site on wix..................n.........o??????? Today went really well! The profs teaching the class I had to struggle for weeks to get into are super cool + I’m very excited for it! I also got the projector working and the people at lock up were surprisingly nice   heading home early now 
Still have to decide onlast class. Aaa that sounds so lovely!! Enjoy you two!! Meanwhile the screen studio is completely barren but they have class tomorrow so hopefully shit will be together by next week   I def don’t have $150 rn so hopefully he’s willing to just let me use all my own supplies and use it for free again like he let that other student  pic.twitter.com/07SXhBZpeV. MBTA said “Trans Rights!” pic.twitter.com/7f2HGDqbl2. Porter! . LMFAOO BRANDEIS CAMPUS there’s just like idk three or four dozen guys in this field throwing frisbees is this like. Frisbee tryouts? It looks very funny.. Oof yeah I definitely did smth to my ear..between the nausea, vertigo, and ear pain which I had at first and then now that I’m wearing ear buds for the first time on the side I hit my head... scary thunderstorms..glad I got out early D:. Haven’t tried clip studio but that makes a lot of sense!! Any time my photoshop set up resets I’m instantly overwhelmed and change it back to my usual - tools, navigator, layers, history and ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ELSE . i think everyone in the world must have at least one of my rescue charms by now. reading job listings
mom: UP/S package handler
me *""sexy voice"": i'm a professional package handler
mom: loading, unloading
me: *same voice*: oh~~  wanna unload your package?
mom: /jennie/. Ugh I don’t wanna take this BS class but they changed the prof on the other class last minute and this one has 0 online presence so I can’t see her work which makes me even less inclined to take it and feel like they just picked someone random cause the first person fell thru. ohmygod there's some beeping outside and Cady is so sensitive to it?? distracted her w treats but she was shaking??? HER TEETH EVEN CHATTERED i don't think I've ever heard that before. Aaa cady is sensitive to that too! In our last house she almost never went up to our bedrooms — then the downstairs smoke alarm ran out of batteries and she came up drooling and shaking   I wonder what it is about the beeps that upset our pups so much.

I don’t want another class I want this job as a print monitor cause I practically fucking do that already!!!!!!! Like last year after my prof left that place was constantly out of everything so I was always cutting up cardboard, tabs, rummaging for chemicals, etc. Imagine instead of paying $150 for semester I could make $120 a week oh god???? Casually emails screen prof to ask if she’d be a reference .........wtf am I doing. you know you're done drawing for the night when you drop your tablet pen down the crack between the two parts of the couch. Filed under: not any of the wips I could’ve finished ....and now it is added to that category  pic.twitter.com/7J4l75K6Cw. so far out of the kny characters i've drawn giyuu has been the hardest for me and I feel attacked. BNHA spoilers sorta without context

School: take more classes or perish!
Studio: we need monitors!

I checked for buns of which there were None but I saved a handful of frogs and crickets  pic.twitter.com/ayxWnrkm1w. Curious to see what happens bc my hair is a spectrum of brass to ash   hence toning w daily one to see what happens, then probably the more pigmented one after depending on how it looks....send good, purple vibes  pic.twitter.com/rrZmTsSqnX.

reminded me of when Mob was in that alt world.. my doctor wrote me a letter about my concussion which I appreciate but it sounds Insane the way she wrote it. SERIOUSLY WHO FUCKING WROTE THAT oh my god I couldn't focus the whole rest of the episode. the writer: hehe he loves her that much :)
me: the psychological repercussions of----. RIGHT like they showed us what? 10 times ? if he said 25 times that'd be like 2 hours i'd be more than satisfied but MONTHS???????????????? bro???? u ok??????? watching Kyo fumble his way through a conversation with Tohru is like when you're playing a dating sim and pick the wrong dialogue option. here you go

I hope this new policy saves you some $ and frustration . Lmfaoo I remember when my bro was first living in Colombia he was upset he couldn’t roll his r’s and would sometimes ask me how I did it and then one day months later out of the blue he facetimes me and says nothing, just goes “rrrrrrrrrrrrr” and I’m like wtf are you —- OH!! .

TT A TT I love seeing all your butterfly pics and stories!! formatting charms to order where's that kny height chart at LMFAO. ohh  the three boys are almost the same height..thank u. the number of people wanting inosuke on a pink strap is making me giggle y'all live your best lives, ok?? <3. I hate guessing charm quantities !!!!!! Gaaaaahh. so far like 90% of my orders are for inosuke...MY FOLLOWERS AND I JUST LIKE ROWDY BOYS..........  tanjiro is so good tho and nezuko is precious and zenitsu is popular in fan art and polls so I'm out here like?????????   good luck with your decisions friend! lmfaoo for this class we each have to add 2 "contacts" to this list of art directors, etc. and i was like 'if i don't list om*cat this week some other fuckin weeb will' and alas .

Abt..both studio classes so it’s gonna be a 10 hour day..send good vibes . (muffled screaming) it's weird sitting at the front!! send help class hasn't even started. \o/ *throws darts at the wall* WE DID IT lmfaoo. Half way update! It’s going well! Twice at the beginning I totally lost my train of thought..usually I’ll stumble but not totally blank, thanks concussion   it happens a lot lately...I’ll use more notes for a bit. pls pray for me if she keeps us more than 10  minutes longer then i'm stuck here for 1- 2 hr extra. So tired I asked and left ubsnsnsmaaman
Also this dude deadass having a beer and slice of pizza on the train. Update: won’t have these by #ladiescon  cause your girl can’t afford rush order fees rn, but if youre there come by and preorder in person to get free shipping!   I will have them by #AAC  #anotheranimecon  tho! Also my prof wants to use the guest speaker budget on smth cooler so guess I’m teaching repeat pattern making . This gonna be a goddamn mess. ALSO I’m so sorry I did change it before make this promo but posted an outdated version by mistake—  I did change Tanjiro’s earring design to the alternate official design  - the actual charms will have the alt!!   I apologize for my mistake! Please RT the main post with my shop link but just FYI Here is the final Tanjiro that I sent to the printer this morning!  pic.twitter.com/diOEH2A9aW. Hey y’all catch me being annoying tomorrow because we’re in the FINAL 24 HOURS!  https:// twitter.com/cambrasine/sta tus/1170418260271128576   …. My mom: home all day
Me: gone for ten hours 
Cady: pic.twitter.com/bugzJD3mDo. e*tsy's new policy (regarding free shipping) is bullshit but i uh..made more sales than usual the last couple days since I conformed to it.. Y'ALL. there's still 24 hours left for this to go up or down but as of rn we hit the stretch goal to give all >$5 tiers a free sticker * U* <3 <3 <3. me too . Not all at once (usually) but  https:// twitter.com/Blues_Got_Cup/ status/1160672052212371457   … pic.twitter.com/msLMReY015. once of the reasons I went to this school was bc they preached about keeping tuition low --- and when I started school at this cursed place it was just $555 per credit.. and now it is $950 per credit :) :) :) yet their financial aid has not increased :) :). shoutout to myself for almost forgetting to do three things and then not forgetting them. landon: doki doki
julian: doki doki

me: doki doki. THEY'RE GETTING SO COZY i'm soft. LMFAOO YOU SHOULD
ohmygod I can see how that would be tricky to solve!!! and on smth that costs more the bigger you make it too...
may I suggest: https://www. youtube.com/watch?v=1L3ifx 7zIzA   …. PFFF I WOULD ABSOLUTELY LOSE MY MIND -slams down dollars for TINF x GSNK merch- . Lmfao I got my first rude, unnecessary Instagram comment today and yes it really did take this long pic.twitter.com/nZondB9Uyy. Also idk how to deal w these things..leave it? Delete it? Feels weird to censor things but also like..stop . LRT LMFAOOO INOSUKKEEE. Yeah I think they’re probably not expecting a response or anything, just wanted to leave something nice for me to wake up to . It really is confusing to me why people do this but also some people send d*eath threats and shit too so . Humans are whack

Hm I see this perspective too!! I think maybe I’ll leave it for a bit and if I remember to delete it later then I do and if not then /shrug. Aaa that’s true! No fighting has ever broken out on my posts and I would like to keep it that way. I don’t really think it would happen after so many days but you never know.. Me, ordering charms yesterday: well most of my sales have been inosuke but surely the other characters have fans too! I’ll divide it mostly evenly but get slightly more of him 
(More orders for just inosuke)
Me: . NYANJIROU. Omg,, you’re right, I’m so foolish. They said no offense, which completely offsets the rudeness of their comment and they are completely absolved of any wrong-doing!! i forgot that’s how it works!!   . Holed up in my room cause my uncle is here. It’s almost 1 fucking leaveeee !!!!!!!!!!!! I even told him off in my dream last night so I haven’t even encountered him and my patience is at ZERO. Putting the fanny back in fanny pack today  pic.twitter.com/WpEiXoC0Vt. My mom: (talking about how she’s done helping my uncle)
My uncle: (calls)
Mom: hold on let me just— (answers)
. also my uncle accidentally told us we weren't invited to my cousins wedding while my mom was doing favors for him lmfaooo bye. LRT ESHGDRTH WHY IS THS???? THE FUNNIEST HSIT IMVE EVER SEEN. god I love a meme about style inconsistency #4styles 

sometimes you consciously choose to draw things in a different style
sometimes you don't
and always its ok  pic.twitter.com/JeW74Lp8fE. thought process: is that a penis? > is that a horse? > is that photoshopped? > ANTS. LMFAOO oh no a lot of the kids in my surface class a....are also in my other class..hello i teach but also i am baby. ..I WENT TO UPLOAD MY PRESENTATION AND EVERYONES IS SO FULL OF PERSONALITY and now i feel silly...... me, crying while presently: IM FUNNY TOO I PROMISE. Presenting oh my god brain WORK. @ grimmfirefly  :p. Tbh it took me like. A lot of episodes to get into it. Like more than I’d probably normally try if everyone wasn’t telling me how good it is but I am happy now and have lots of new children. Manga readers do we ever get long haired tanjirou back? :(. Yukfun recently put out a guide of how they do it !
 http://www. yukfun.co.uk/yuk-fun/how-to -screen-print-at-home/   … 

Good luck!! I hope to get to this someday too . darn :(
thank you for the info <3. JUST THREE HOURS LEFT!

TBH I was feeling a bit discouraged again when we dropped below goal a few days ago, but now it's been going up and up TT A TT <3 Thank you lovelies!! https:// twitter.com/cambrasine/sta tus/1170418260271128576   …. um so far what i've learned this semester is I really did not know the name of anyone in my self publishing class last semester. I LOVED THAT SOMEONE ELSE REQUESTED NEZUMI.. so happy seeing these boys on my TL in the year of our lord 2019 <3 <3 <3 thank you for blessing me. aaa yeah i liked it!! it was a nice length! u nu
he's still a good good boy without it tho. set up my backer surveys so I don't have to deal with them later~. ah yes, the time of year where my mom loves inflicting mental suffering on herself and by extension me by reading sale 9/*11 stories and relaying them to me even tho I have expressed not wanting to hear them. I have learned probably about 60% of students names but there's two girls who wear similar glasses and have the exact same style+color+length hair and i think they're trying to kill me u nu. Ready for me to stop posting about this already?
Big same and GOOD - BECAUSE THERE'S JUST 30 MINUTES LEFT! https:// twitter.com/cambrasine/sta tus/1170418260271128576   …. seriously y'all I'm so grateful - the goal I set was like my minimum (note that KS includes every backer's shipping towards the goal, which they absolutely shouldn't) since I could contribute a small portion but now I prob don't have to put much out of pocket -- a big relief! <3. Class is in half an hour still no word on where we’re meeting since the school decided that room was unavailable suddenly. Anyway I forgot to put on deodorant and it’s 85 and I have a presentation lmfao. Someone during their presentation: aaand sometimes I do anime art because it’s easier 
Me: (snaps pencil). (I did not snap my pencil bc I was not holding one but I did make a face like Jim on the office). Also like isn’t that just rude as hell to your classmates? Several of whom showed at least one or two pieces in an anime/manga influenced style? I LOVE THIS THEY ARE SO FASHIONABLE!! made all my backer surveys but i'm just sitting on them cause I feel like I should ask more questions than their shipping address but? i don't think there's anything else? (Aside from flavors on the charm rewards). me: Look at him (inosuke nitotan)
mom: uhuh.
me: WHAT? I DIDn'T BUY HIM!!!
mom: i didn't say anything -- hey you can do whatever you want
me: I didn't do anything!! . there's also a new kirishima nitotan AND I don't the My Hero & You or whatever the fuck they're called Kiri plushes and they're THE CUTEST asedrftghj /suffering. fDGDH THAT EPISODE OF LADYBUG WAS REALLY GOOD..

"Listen to your heart~~"
"NO, LISTEN TO YOUR BRAIN!!"

also Adrien calling Lila out is so satisfying and that's the most menacing "because we're friends" I've fucking heard. YES I also thought that :( I mean she's flighty af but they should know she's not uhhh a thief also I love how the thieving part sent everyone over the edge when like imagine if she DID  ACTUALLY PUSH SOMEONE DOWN THE STAIRS WHY WAS THAT NOT THE BIGGER DEAL. oh no someone has the new hero kiri nitotan for only $10 ...should..I..............do that..... macklemore voice: but shit it was --- $10
for real tho I could resell him for at least that much if I change my mind..it's..a good deal. You can tell how genuinely satisfied I was that I got out of class early enough to get a swim in on one of the last *hot* hot days  pic.twitter.com/Vf4l216jqT. Yes indeed  pic.twitter.com/A1snog7lX2. Ohmygod every time my ears ring I have about seven heart attacks thinking MAYBE THIS IS THE TIME IT NEVER STOPS. This is horrifying to me I am very scared of tinnitus.

me at 2 PM: ..what is it that I have to do again? anyway,,,, lists amirite. I like this illustration overall but Bakugou does in fact look like he’s asking his spouse to “get him another beer already” and if they say “I think you’ve had enough” he’ll throw the bottle in his hand at the wall . "um when is AAC again because that's in Chelmsford and Pop Eye's is in Chelmsford" - my mom. also i forgot how awful it is trying to order stock when money is tighter and cons are fewer . Sent backer surveys for clay charm tiers! I was all for the camel but wow the cream really pops!! me: hm i'll do things after dinner...i'll have more energy after dinner
me, after dinner: well, time for bed. for reference I didn't get out of bed til 1:30 today please send help. Omg the bat looks so content in his bubble bath . me: hmm this looks ok..maybe I can perfect it in photoshop
(traces in photoshop)
me: oh no it's actually bad. jennie tries hand lettering take 1. "damn, wish that were me". can't wait for them to leave you a two star review bc you didn't give them the /RANDOM/ button they chose. me@my type prof on monday: ooh, yeah, you're gonna have to fix this. you vs the guy she tells you not to worry about pic.twitter.com/D4sHzf4SPS. I want the chonk. GIVE ME TH E CHONK. chonky tanjirou and giyuu are also very good. me: LOOK HOW CHUNKY HE IS

Haven’t watched it yet but it’s That episode of furuba today. Cady and Pichi (RIP) pic.twitter.com/IwDuLrP3pp. CA sales tax (for AX) is crazy high . Hello someone else buy a set of sleepy time charms so I can justify buying wide tanjiro plush . Me: maybe I’ll combine his wolf outfits, the collar’s cute
Me: oh god now they look like a collar and leash couple at a family friend convention. Oh shit. Was trying to do some casual figure drawing but accidentally selected a category of dudes w abs and bubble butts and figured after that I might as well draw lewd ladies too . I often ignore instas no “female nips” policy but dicks out is prob too far lmfao. FUCkin,,, /kitty tears/ oh my god

Supposed to finish charms and prints but got distracted . so cold in here my nose is running@the weather stop doing the changing thing. I just..love this...I’m struggling w vocab but just like..the mood? Is very very good. literally just found this while cleaning the other day!!

If less than 30% of the population at any given con is wearing uchuu summer merch then by law you are entitled to a free table at the next year’s event. Crying in the club bc they sent me less of Inosuke and now I have to email them. Gloomy day lighting but babies are here! I’ll have these for #ladiescon  and #aac  / #anotheranimeconvention  later this month!

also confidence for my design class is 0, much worry. Giving myself a D- on drinking water pic.twitter.com/hNgMcQTX3v. If you’re illustrating the design too then I think that’s really low tbh  esp w how high demand is for your work ! Also there was a sticker on my sleeve 
Goodnight. Update I didn’t get the print monitor job, here’s hoping those fuckers actually show up so the place doesn’t fall apart again. The guy said $100 fee which is $50 less than the fee I paid in fall but in spring I got to use it for free so I’m gonna say that bc I don’t have monies. I’m gonna say is meekly tho cause I don’t wanna get on his bad side since he’s newly in charge and I would actually like to TA screen or be a monitor sometime. pic.twitter.com/JvMbaBhWbP. Monday’s are so hectic. Now I have to not only eat but also rent a computer between classes ..head hurts djdndj. I’m about 87% sure my classmate drew Ash and wrote Sad Boy Hour for this assignment. what a cutie!! miraculous  / startrain spoilers

I was underwhelmed by some of the others so far but i was kinda into max's transformation actually!! 
also sleepy kids cuddling..very cute, much middle school. (RINGS THE ALARM BELLS) 
Y'ALL !!!!!

 IT'S HAPPENING. me: (on my deathbed) how long has it been? 84 years?
kickstarter: one week. one more week before we give you the money to do the thing :)
me: (flatlines). what do you mean i'm being dramatic???????
LMFAOO no but i would love to cross things off my list but yknow. money. my mom: what's he called? wide tanjiro? (starts typing that into ebay)
me: RDKFGDhdfhgfhj. i don't have a desk or a cubicle but if I  did I'd have framed photos of Cady, Kirishima Eijirou, and Wide Tanjirou TM. I maybe had. A small mental breakdown at school today and may drop a class. The prof is cool+I really want to learn it but..it’s a five hour class and half an hour after my first five hour class which I have to arrive 45 minutes early for and also one hour commute each way.. and I couldn’t focus at all and I misspelled silkscreen so many times not JUST today but also last week and it was moderately horrifying how much my brain wasn’t working. I just don’t know what to do but I have to decide tomorrow. I want to do it but I dont wanna feel this way every week. Even my bro who always challenges himself and always encourages and pushes me was like jenn that sounds like a lot hnnnndndnd ugh. Me: wow it’s already almost one
The clock: I SAID it’s almost /two/. Sbbshdsh thanks mariessa   it’s just frustrating bc I really want to take the class but not if I’m going to arrive to it barely functioning each week .  sending no-crash vibes. I’m excited to seeeeee promare this week!! I haven’t gotten too spoiled surprisingly and the characters and animation look fun . About to be the devils advocate but genuinely a concern: What if you hit the sort by name thing twice so it’s in reverse order and then they’re at the top. Goodnight pic.twitter.com/E8DiOoc7SQ. me: i could come before or after your classes
this guy: i'm teaching at that time could u come another time
me: .................. Gorgeous! There’s always such an amazing flow to your work. I know this was a joke but I have had one it was Just Ok. i respect that, free food is free food. Maybe offer them that they could pay more for a different service? Like if they’re countries / main post office is unreliable sometimes FedEx/UPS/DHL or whatever will be a better bet. But also some places just don’t really Do mail and it’s out of your control :(. I constructed a very special treat for a very special girl pic.twitter.com/vp1Qzpr4Do. Yknow. The ‘nald’s. pic.twitter.com/aYOGfdcgSI. Oh dope I won a gift card. No you’re not seeing things — this bitch Is wearing jeans  
Also I left now but 59 is not as cold as I thought and I didn’t mean to wear pants before I had to  pic.twitter.com/RnrNUHwg45. Really digging this song even though last night he referred to it as “the bottom of the pit” on the set list’s scale of depressing  https:// m.youtube.com/watch?v=IOX30C Hr4JY   …. OH I GET TO SEE PROMARE TOMORROW 
This is maybe my fourth tweet about it sorry I’m just so curious. Lrt this is the cutest shit I’ve seen. lmfaoo the one time i remember to order those stupid fancy straps in time the package gets lost. hello i would like to feel better than i currently do so i can get things done. Omg UPS “about your package..we’re gonna have to wait and see what happens..have a good day!” . Ohmygod I literally was just on the phone w a woman who said the scan in KY wasn’t a scan of the actual package but of the container it was Supposed to be in meaning it may not have even made it to KY, then this voicemail is from MA saying yeah it’s not here it’s in KY..y’all.  express shipping isn’t so fast when they lose your package huh. Don’t give up hope my friend - a few years ago I ordered charms with 2-day shipping for a con and they arrived 60 or 90 something days later (fedex). But yes also Louisville. They found it during Christmas shipping season and it arrived w the original package completely ripped open, thrown in a giant box with a few giant pieces of paper, and no note or other acknowledgement. Mom: if you fall asleep want me to wake you up?
Me: yeah an hour would be good (doesn’t set alarm)

Me: (wakes up on my own nearly four hours later)
Me: .......why. I haven’t gotten up yet but in my heart of hearts I know that she is sleeping too   (we were both feeling kinda off today..! The nap helped I feel a lot better than I did all day but also uh now i slept four hours and it’s 11:30 and I’m awake. just so y'all know she was Not sleeping she just fucked up lMFAOO
she was like 'well by the time i remembered i was like it's too late so I just let you keep slepeing'. omg his tootsies :(
but you're right his face is super cute!! live your dreams. me: no energy to do things things
me: naps
me: keeps cooking and baking and eating
me: no energy to do the things
me: sleep???????????????? If you want smth shipped this week please order now cause I’ll be at a con this weekend ! ...dope pic.twitter.com/5fMETaZhQr. As if the work wasn’t loud enough of the guys is playing screamo   rip my productivity. Writing a very dramatic email bc my school is being obnoxious about a medical note , absolutely no one is shocked. may literally have to switch schools because these people don't give a fuck like i hit my head i was misspelling words and couldn't focus and I have a fucking doctor's note saying i /injured my brain/ and they still wanna take my financial aid bc i'm 1.5 credits short. me, on the verge of tears: i don't even know what to do with this place anymore
mom: the disability services guy said he'd call over, maybe he has some clout..
me: (sniffle) did you just use the word clout? 100%. I want to nap but my room is covered in like. Fiberglass dust. I don’t wanna be too tired to enjoy/remember the movie tonight :(. Uggggggggggghhhhhhhhh seriously. ....this actually isn’t the worst idea (except the neighbor is still sawing it may be louder outside). I wanted to dress on theme tonight but I still barely know what promare is about send help. That’s about where I am too   wish I had some neon clothes right about now. Update I napped in the guest room, this bed is tiny and the sun is on this side in the afternoon but I successfully stayed completely still while I slept pic.twitter.com/QdNL9yd3M4. Cady also napping pic.twitter.com/HgZNiRDHP2. Mom: just wear something comfy 
Me, picking out an entirely leather/pleather outfit: ... P R O M A R E. Post promare
Guy: but I don’t understand why it happened in the first place 
Me, internally: because it’s the premise of the movie. Promare spoiler

Fellas is it gay to kiss the fire-y life back into your bro. IT WAS SO LONG I WAS SURPRISED BUT I MEAN THAt in a good way  wow. god Yknow i love an idiot and Lio is such a cutie pie. Promare fan art in riso would be soo beautiful ..give me n e o n s. Turns out it IS possible to lock yourself out of our car!!! Get wrecked! Also bag w sketchbook is in there and my phones at 1% so no fun while I wait. Ohh the AAA guy was cute 
Alright home we go. Also if you’re looking to lock yourself out of a car you wanna hit the lock on the door on the way out, close the door enough that it won’t open again but not so much that the car registers it as closed and beeps to let you know hey you left the key in. Vaguely Lio inspired outfit but I just donated my shirt with the front ruffle a few weeks ago rippy pic.twitter.com/1Ld4o9OoKi. me, downloading Given after watching promare: time for something very different but just as gay. oh !! thank you friend! given spoiler //

GAH i forgot one of them  said i like you so is this the episode where everything goes to hell even tho it's mutual. YES!! I'm so sad I didn't get to see it in Boston cause I was too slow on the tickets!! so I went more locally..which is convenient but I'm sure I would've run into y'all/others if I went to there instead!! dfghjkdfg haru ,, too kind ; u;. WAITTTT GIVEN IS..OVER?? well, this season or whatever? help I wasn't ready......................time to read the manga? lots of loose ends. aa yeah I did see that!! I want more of the kiddos too tho! Do you know if the manga goes past this point? ..Also seemed like Violin Man was gonna make trouble but nothing happened. ugh not sleeping in my room tonight, i can feel my throat burning from inhaling shit..they should finish tomorrow......pour one out for my room being the only accessible way to access the attic. I literally thought “cj would make a cool print of this”. ok I already knew this person was being absurd but I have returned now that I’ve seen it - the subs went “you’re just a kid!” And then something along the lines of “I could say the same about you” so it was implied they’re the same age. in this essay I will. Me: wow a new thing to enjoy!!
Discourse: hey girl ;)
Me: noooOOOOOOOOOO. ..YOU GOOD BUDDY? Lmfaoo. i've been so toasted the past several days from school, moving shit for this work to be done on the house, and being woken up early for the work....not being able to sleep in my bed.............gotta..pack for..ladies con....................... aa thank you friend <3. also i forgot to ask to be next to you tomorrow bc im a fool. THANK YOU!! I will fight on ahah. ordered more straps in hopes they'll come for AAC since the first package is lost for the forseeable future, UPS better plan on giving me my $19 for the /first/ express shipping back :). Looking like a crime scene pic.twitter.com/vyFY7YFjBf. Can't speak about RI as a whole but my bro went to school in Providence so I'm a bit familiar! I really enjoyed visiting him there - lots of shops on Thayer and in downtown, huge mall if you're into that, better art/music scene than Boston as far as I'm aware, AS220, etc. I love half palm gloves and I want to own some someday. Cady is unhappy about the floor floating during the airflow test thing   pic.twitter.com/0uBtu16Np3. imo A, B, and E will translate best into wooden pins!! I can see B esp on that painted maple . (This goes without saying but they’re all v cute). Hey y’all! I’ll be tabling at #ladiescon  tomorrow! It’s FREE TO ATTEND!

A comic con hosted by @ComicaziLadies  with a focus on women, non-binary folks, and the LGBT+ community. All are welcome, so COME THRU! pic.twitter.com/kBFtDVDtlM. Just wanna draw Galo carrying Lio a thousand different ways but most importantly 
The fireman’s carry. Hello I wasn’t joking pic.twitter.com/H7nQrd53Uo. THIS IS ALSO VERY GOOD. pssst go watch promare if you can, they added more showtimes in a lot of places -- seems it's playing in Boston through Wednesday now (eyes emoji). Aaa I’ll send good vibes to you!! I wanna see the dub too but they added all sub showings . Yes I rt’d my receipt doodles just try to stop me. Why does food cost money. This is about how I want Chinese food I’m sorry it’s not that deep. Spoiler

No one has any like...screen caps of Lio in the volcano do they... #promare. Ohhh  
I wasn’t thinking of a particular image just couldn’t remember what it looked like and was wondering if it’d be inspirational  I remember a really colorful Lio in space too maybe during that whole long explanation. SORRY THATS ALL KINDA VAGUE SO NO WORRIEs if not . i ate a whole donut send help. fdgdgfdh my prof wants me to complain at the place where you rent supplies about the color on the projector but I uhh ....that's not their job.. What year is it my calendar says 2019 but it must be wrong. Yuki and Kyo, friends at last pic.twitter.com/G6HMtr6qRw. I kept saying pro-mare by mistake bc I thought it was actually pro-ma-rae, took many tries to fix it in my brain, then saw people discussing how it was spelled in Japanese and had to fix it back. Stumbled upon a very chaotic store rp asmr video where the person runs off-screen for like 10 seconds at a time /constantly/ like the Target Lady from SNL. Driving in the city takes 
A long time
So many stoplights. Here til 5 today come through!! https:// twitter.com/cambrasine/sta tus/1175094565239513088   …. Thank you so much for stopping by today!! And for this compliment and lovely video!   Hope you enjoyed the con!! Lrt I feel like I printed a million of these last semester ..yet I don’t have so many left for MICE!! . cady really likes my dog walker's puppy and it's cute as hell.  last time when the pup was in the back seat she ran up and jumped on the car and gave him kisses through the window and the dog walker said she did that again today . did not know .pages was a file extension but here we are. hi there's probably an actual survey of this somewhere but hey non-jews: do you know what a mezuzah is?

this came up bc my mom took ours down while they were doing work and the guy wanted to pry it off with a hammer lmfao. LMFAOO to be fair i had to google it like three times to spell it right
no shaming here,  just out of curiousity!! yes indeed!   (now give your brain a pat on the back for remembering something from high school, i think mine blocked that shit out LMFAOO). Aah I totally agree! I never got to take a class like that but I enjoyed getting bits of it in regular history courses!! Yes!! We had challah every Friday afternoon when I went to Jewish day school.....I HATE TO SAY I DON'T ACTUALLY LOVE SWEET BREADS but now it's very nostalgic to have it from time to time..i'd like to learn how to make it!! THIS IS SO PRECIOUS. Hello I was rubbing my eye and I somehow broke my nail on the bridge of my nose. mom: premiere--
me: PROMARE??? My brain says restore energy by sleeping but my stomach says eat cake. She keeps doing this omg .. she missed me today~~~ pic.twitter.com/TKsnWhyVvL. LMFAOO the power went out for half a second and my mom and I both just both went “oh no” in unison in the dark . This is pretty similar to the cake I had tbh . Waiting to watch kny til tomorrow when I’m not too tired to enjoy it to the fullest . Lrt all I know is I’m not ready. Huge shoutout to the first day of my period for not landing on the day before or day of a con, nor a day I have class. Usually if it’s late it’s rearranging itself to be during a con - You had me in the first half not gonna lie. However today was maybe the last day I can swim in the pond this year and that’s out the window now, send unexpected heat wave vibes. Anyway friendly reminder to get a credit card reader if you do craft fairs, artists alleys, etc. because literally 80% of my sales yesterday were card . I got so nervous counting the cash I was like "uhh did I..did I drop some???"

Also friendly reminder to shoppers to remember cash if ya can cause those things do take fees! RIGHT? IT WAS SO SURPRISING ...I don’t have the number but I feel like usually it’s only like..30-40% card. Andy..I seriously love this. I feel like this is most glamorous piece of yours yet!!! Watching your Wag adventures is so fun   get that bread, post those pics . It’s so beautiful outside..warm and a light breeze..I could sit here forever. ok about to email the new studio guy for the Fourth time so maybe i can start printing eventually????????? omg cady started drinking my water.. it is hers now..her snout barely fits in the mug too . I was really excited about being TA and it'll still look good on my resume but I've got lots of random tasks and had to drop a class I /really/ wanted to take so I'm feeling disillusioned. I’m being subjected to a lot of random whims that were not part of the class when I took it just last time . I think I’d be more down if it wasn’t 
> worth only half the credits 
> I’m paying for the credits instead of it being free or getting paid. i wanna see promare again but I kinda wish it was out digitally already so i could just hit pause every .2 seconds and ooh and awe like ya can't in theaters :(. THEYRE PERFECT IN YOUR STYLE. Feel necessary to preface this by saying idk which projects this is referring too but like uh yeah if you’re teetering on the edge of committing fraud people are gonna “hassle” you   Such a shame bc people will lose faith in different future projects when people pull that crap. LMFAOO. Oh no a cute boy asked me for help but it was for the class I had to drop so I couldn’t help 
Rest in pieces :(. Lrt so fluid . Anyway my worst nightmare of having trouble w the projector came true today - it still wouldn’t respond after tapping on the screen dozens of times, reset it twice with no luck, and then the IT guy comes and does nothing, taps just like I did 3 times, suddenly it’s working . GREYYY THIS IS SO BEAUTFIUL??? He looks so elegant in your style . lrt am i about to apply for a zine for the first time in like
. over a year. /crawls out of a school-shaped hole
please i just want
energy to 

draw promare fan art. I got out of it with a doctor's letter about anxiety;;. yeah, she did. I've had it for a long time;;. I normally only peel the protective layer off charms if I’m assembling them in some way ..what do you do?(or customers what do you prefer?)

..i might not peel all these there’s paper on both sides. me: is it stupid to make promare merch
everyone: (making promare merch)
me: oh shit. 75% of orders done!! feeling nauseous so i'm gonna take a break but i'll get the rest out before the con this weekend! Tfw you’re trying to show someone strap options but your dog things everything is for her  pic.twitter.com/APMSNSNqiz. Omg   dogs see more limited color too, but she doesn’t let that stop her . An icon.   pic.twitter.com/GJIp4zmtjB. THIS IS SO PRECIOUS I WANT TWENTY. FOOD? Sorry, she’s not for sale~~ . I wonder if having ended at 11:59 means I have to wait another day for KS monies  . Gwah pic.twitter.com/EASyRXoKE5. Fun news the riso lab at school now has actual public schedule with hours every day. “But jenn, isn’t that how it should have been the last two years as well?” “Of course, but it wasn’t”. Bro r u ok bro... ...bro . School email subject line: EMERGENCY.. 
Me: !!!
Subject line: ..NEWTORK MAINTENANCE. It is except this time
I’m there. LMFAOOO. Also I laid down cause I had a headache then eventually fell asleep even tho I had enough sleep and woke up still with a headache so there goes the day . Lrt me: this is the closest to my style I’ve seen promare fan art in..looks really cute
Me: /Debbie/

Idk why but like. If I had control over how I drew I’d want to end up at something like their or s*ra kipin’s art..but I’m not gonna do anything abt it..does that make sense..?? cosumik69

(sorry I'm also bad at this so I have no real suggestions, I just saw an opportunity and I Took It). lrt mookie's style is so suited to him lmfao. also this sounds insane but if it *really* bothers you - sometimes companies do this shit...and also theres a whole black market for original usernames of plain popular words but anyway--- you could message the person who has it and try to buy the username from them. I feel like I rarely consciously choose to incorporate elements.. I feel like I only have so much control over how my art comes out anyway but if it ends up involving into something like those artists I admire I'll be happy and when it doesn't that's cool too LMFAO. oof yeah that's rough ; n;
I'm out of ideas but I wish you luck!! I'm sure you'll figure something out!! . wanna make. tiny promare riso zine but i don't have the time, energy , or knowledge.. a collab could be fun.. but again me and the riso are strangers so it seems .ill-advised ..though I think it is accompanied by a Human who will do the thing for me. if only they weren't thin pajama pants i could wear them out  (Thank you!~). I wish I could make stickers for tomorrow but I don't think I have any vinyl :(. Curious to see if tomorrow’s audience is people who were late to the party seeing what the buzz is about or full of dumbasses seeing it for their second/third/fourth time (myself and friends included ). OHH THIS SUITS THEM SO MUCH. care u. Orange under my nail and I’m genuinely unsure if it’s ink or Cheeto dust. I screen printed for the first time since spring today and it went really well!! :). Here she is, the least practical mug in the world pic.twitter.com/DRhsYllCSd. It works it just holds sooo much less  pic.twitter.com/CubxnsdESU. it was really good to see promare again..the first time they were doing work on the house and i napped before but i was still kinda fucked up so this was good to reinforce it in my brain and I got to see some of the tiny fast movements in the animation that I missed before * U*. LRT LMFAOO IS EIJI JUST??A CA T????? hello please pity me is there official art of those three as cheerleaders cause i can't find it. ITS NOT EVEN A BLACK CAT EIJI U FUCKED UP. i shouold have tagged this #promare  #プロメア https:// twitter.com/cambrasine/sta tus/1177063470866546688   …. RIGHT I wonder if it was a thing in the Japanese fandom or official art?? I can't figure it out D:. i'll let you know if I hear anything TT A TT when I tried searching I'd only find fan art of people going to the like uh cheering showings of the movie;;. KS $ finally arrived !! will send the rest of the surveys and post an update probably tomorrow but i have a con this weekend so also maybe not til mon/tues!!;;. I had a pretty atrocious Galo color/themed outfit ready for this evening but I was too tired from class/screenprinting to follow through pic.twitter.com/pGIt1AxvhX. Lrt hating your work isn’t cute! I’ve been improving but there were times during crits when I’d start presenting my work talking about it negatively - then when people praised it I felt /worse/ about myself, ashamed of my low selfconfidence+embarrassed I showed that vulnerability. The only thing I’ve found to help besides painkillers is heating pad but it’s not very practical :( hope u feel better soon . I love y’all but I can’t recognize a single soul on my TL bc we all have fucking promare icons. Uhhh tummy not happy. My mom got sick and threw up a couple days ago so pray for me . Lrt ohh this look for kiri tho . Your chunky outside lines are so satisfying . Me: well maybe starting Tuesday I can relax..
Texts: (two appointment reminders)
Me: son of a ——. I’m gonna go visit the riso lab after class on Monday. Narrator: it wasn’t pic.twitter.com/EwJSbDeYHC. LMFAOO I WISHH the MICA (ex-MICA?) crew is always making the coolest shit . Sndbdhs bruh if I had spare money rn I’d commission you too and we could make some Mad Burnish gang looking crew   I’m so excited to see tho!! Aaaa. I bought a color chart from a riso artist I adore like ILL NEED THIS ONCE I START PRINTING cut to a year later and I haven’t done shit   One of these days tho mark my words!! Aaa I bet hutanna would make some amazing holo promare art but ,,, $ .

We're a bit dead inside but..come through  
ps pls yell about Promare with us pic.twitter.com/CAqOglJZTp. Sorry if I’m a bit frazzled tomorrow I’m trying really hard to prepare some stuff but I woke up a bit sick and it’s hard to focus. Certain places had extended it til yesterday, and then  another week (ie Boston, probably NY, etc.). this is the only thing i'm capable of lately. mom: is it fruits basket friday?
me: (chuckles darkly) you fool... damn wish this -- weren't also me. Mood...at the point where I want a break but also really need the $ rn so . I can picture him in your style. If one more person at school spells my name with a Y I’m going to Mcfreakin lose it 
How many emails have I signed Jennie already, please my crops are dying. can't believe I haven't seen any promare x ghibli crossovers yet?? they're probably out there.. Lmfaooooo our relatives blocked my uncle I wish my mom would do the same ok goodnight twitter. The manspread+”come hither” combo was too much for us..powerful. SAME I’ve noticed increased interest in big 3 merch already and I’m like huh I wonder wh—-OH !! SO SOON. It’s that time of year where that one bird comes and sits over my window and tweets out a single high pitched sound over and over again every morning ,,,,please I got you a birdhouse over there,,. Please help I’m trying to find (or find the name of) these old virtual pet websites - one was all dogs and had like weird tiny photo dogs and there was a convenience store and. Park and they’d poop in your house etc nothing was animated you just like clicked to throw stick etc. The other was like a flash website mostly yellow and there were various animals very cartoony and you could shop or bathe or idk helpfndjdnsn. Aaa I found that one it’s  http:// adoptme.com    !! I can’t find the weird photo one tho. i'm genuinely going crazy over this... I found it a couple years ago but i can't find it (or any reference to it) now aaAAA https:// twitter.com/cambrasine/sta tus/1177719556288200704   …. update i'm 99% sure it was  http:// virtualdog.com    which is now a different website...i need..a screenshot. SFDGFH I FOUND SCREENSHOTS FUCK ITS STILL CREEPY

I can look at the dogs to adopt but I can't get to the game part bc it used to open in a new window..  :( thank you for the suggestion tho! @ egoisticartist  45 years later i  found it. Found this yahoo answers...I s2g this GAME..I’m shakin pic.twitter.com/deEsjP6ATC. Very valid, quality tweet. Toddler: mommy who’s that 
Mom: that’s a..very upset sailor moon pic.twitter.com/5MT0h5QLew. For cons I store minis and mediums in a binder, yeah! :). hello why are the remaining promare showings at bad times. ah yes, 2:00 and 9:30, the ideal times for ABSOLUTELY NO ONEsDGFDHFGh. Aaa I’m so glad he arrived safely!! Thank you for the support! I’m too tired to enjoy KnY finale to the fullest so I’m gonna wait til I’m more energized . Reading promare interview info and feeling like they’re just messing with us it’s so wild . Gahhh these are so frustrating. It’s worse when they don’t even like/pretend to like your work first fjdnndnd. Lrt me and @sara_capello  at AAC. In a perfect world tomorrow the con would start at noon, I’d have Monday off, make merch to hand out and see promare again. Ohmygod this is so precious   honored to be a part of it! I’m tired :(. Hi I’m gonna be a bit late today. Come by at 10 if you want me to be there and ready. IM SO GLAD YOU GOT TO SEE IT. This is so beautiful . On that speckle paper !! . Small brain: make new art for MICE 
Galaxy brain: art from years ago but riso. new short term life goal is just have energy to draw more. tweeting this on 5 hours of sleep, post-3-day-con, school tomorrow really hits. I need to get like 16 hours of sleep tonight or I’ll get sick. Yessss! Promare and your style are a match made in heaven~~. Wish I could take tomorrow off and claim Rosh Hashanah but I said “see you tomorrow” about a million times 

Ps Happy new year . lrt wow ,, he's smiling. you ever need a reference image you can't find and couldn't possibly create. somehow have exactly 0 and 1,000,000 promare print ideas at the same time. People writing in sick to me today..damn wish that were me. Me: I’ll be tired but I’ll just do it
My body: hey!! wanna wake up from mysterious stomach pain and nausea all morning since it’s too late to call out? I went to ask about the riso and it was closed even tho the hours said it was open, sigh. If anyone has a good promare/Galo/Lio whatever Fan mix they could direct me to it’d really cure me. Joop pic.twitter.com/yABxIgAYLA. Sounds healthy . Hm ok my nasty migraine is gone and nausea settled but I slept from 10 pm - 3 am so now I’m ????? I have my physical/post concussion check in in the morning. Sounds bad . Also I didn’t get my blood drawn like it said to bc absolutely when was I supposed to do that (gestures to classes, cons, prep). LRT FNDNDISMSNCBSMSLOS I’m crying. BNHA spoilers Ch 244

I MEAN HES NOT WRONG pic.twitter.com/FKPF2vxPCN. Heh what a cutie 
I’m here for the kids but he’s growing on me. Shdbdj oh no, Really?! I know there’s a lot of art of them but I actually haven’t encountered anything too spoiler-y on my TL yet.. :( I’m sorry if it’s been ruined for you! Guess I’ll 
 Get up and do something. still trying to find the balance between "i swear to god if you don't submit your file" + "haha yeah diane is a lot" w my students
like today i was asked 'i don't want to make this change, do I have to' + I told her 'save another version for yourself, do the thing, get the grade'. gonna go early on wednesday and try to get that good good riso info and if no one's there i'm sending A MEEKLY WORDED EMAIL ESDFGFDHFgh. sure wish it wasn't 4:30 rn cause I feel better than I have in like. at least 5 days. mildly stressed: digital to do list
moderately stressed: paper to do list. anyway I can't find the paper to do list I made the other day so guess i'll go back to bed. Aaa yeah hopefully your mind will have thrown the info you absorbed into the trash bin and you can enjoy it fresh when you see it!! Sndbdubdd took me forever to fall back asleep bc they started doing construction then my alarm for this appointment went off during a really good sleep wave so now I’m tired again and djdncc. Lmfao I just got ready in 6 minutes reminds me of high school. Omg yeah I was gonna shower but instead I hit snooze for like 45 mins then put my hair in a ponytail and peaced out — We have... SUPER SPEED . Doctor: you need three shots and two blood tests 
Me: ...pass. (The shots I need aren’t endangering others so don’t@me). Ok, the rest of the KS surveys are sent! You can change your address up until I'm ready to ship, and you'll get a notice before that happens~. funnyjoke./mov pic.twitter.com/kMzwLvF8Z9. Hope it works out pic.twitter.com/Nzw5Tb7OB1. THIS IS AMAZING!! Congratulations!! (Art critics clapping) Minimalism. October 1st pic.twitter.com/CI2CgAJlpo. i almost went swimming today but the sun was setting by the time the air heated up and clouds cleared ; n;. thank you friend. ehhh so the reason why there's not more dub showings is bc Regal has the dub but the Regal here isn't showing it..even though it normally has special/anime movies :(. somehow the 'movie candy' map is the most controversial thing i've seen all day. my mom bought brisket at a non-Jewish deli (who knows why) and it's ??? like bbq pulled pork..... to a museum. IT WAS VERY SPICY what the what. aaa I finally watched the KnY finale....i can't even imagine how beautiful the movie will look based on those cinema-quality scenes we had but it sucks bc people outside of japan are gonna have to wait even longer to see it > A <. someone please stop me from listening to lio's theme it's so fucking good. never before has gibberish made my brain produce this much serotonin. gaaie savanare~~ (SICK DRUM BEAT). despite my weird (10-3 8-9) night's sleep, i might actually ? check off everything on the to do list I made for today????????? let's take this into 2020 bruh. there has been talk of lio + galo pumpkins in this house.. i've been listening to r*plyall for years and I just wrote in for the first time ever bc i can't get over the former  http:// virtualdog.com    and I'm hoping I can find others who are as confused and fascinated and DISTURBED by it as I amdfgdg. bank account looked nice for one second but then fanny pack order, AX sales tax, table+lodging payment for a 2020 con, etc. TT A TT. Sndjdjed this . If a DM request says “hello” or “can I ask you smth” that shit is staying in requests . WHAT AM I LOOKING AT. Lrt so far I know of two KnY character deaths . Don’t write self-deprecating things on your professional website if you’re trying to get hired??? save that shit for Twitter. Happy .. I love. Ohh turns out I’m classmates w one of the riso lab people   yay! They answered my questions so hopefully I can print smth soon. Screen printing lol pray for me. Lmfaoo they ended up Halloween-y by accident (brighter orange, p much black instead of dark blue) but still cute! I’ll change it for the larger size 

Will have these for #MassMICE  #MICE pic.twitter.com/25xXbIFRHn. Also two for two on dropping my screen on my head which is very bad bc concussion hdhdhdhd. Not very hard but yknow..bonk...............like if I was told yesterday still not to even jog then that prob wasn’t good. I forget about NYCC every year until is Happening. “Looking for a stranger on the internet to receive hundreds or thousands of dollars”. I love a bread clip boy. Holy shit please. /casually watches Promare repeatedly without finishing fan art for it. Holy shit this does look really nice. Hi I own lots of questionable items of clothing what should I wear to Promare - poll in replies

(also sock/shoe variance are options - not gonna wear two different shoes  ) pic.twitter.com/2Sp1EQQqAL. Pics in OP. Galo de Lion pic.twitter.com/m3WKE0k1Hv. Hnn yes I read in an official tweet that AMC would play subs and Regal cinemas had the dub . Me: 8.5 hours of uninterrupted sleep
Also me: still laying in bed for an hour. Also holy shit that Never happens ..I think my head did go bonk a little   I also said I’d never been to a restaurant instead of not having been there lately, said my phone was broken instead of dead, etc..I gotta wear a fucking helmet to screen print or smth. fuckfuck fuck literally just yesterday said to my prof that my nausea from screens was over and then i drop smth on my head and i'm having it again this sucks fgdsgdfh. hey weebs i only have 2 feet at MICE so I'm gonna have to curate a lot and veer towards a non-anime-con audience so if you want something specific please ask me in advance so I can bring it for you!! This man keeping me motivated while counting inventory @sara_capello pic.twitter.com/C2FoInsNUT. uhhh yeah this. it is so wild how people look like their art..i couldn't remember my classmates name so I started looking at everyones portfolios and i'm like 'oh its this one' LMFAO. LMFAOO GOOD LUCK ANDY!! living that last minute life. FSFHFDH ANDY..................you were being so productive by getting rid of it and it BACKFIRED.. let this be a lesson to always let merch gather dust until its completely irrelevant, like moi ahahah. Trying to figure that out;;

For sure: enamel pins, stickers, zines, gotta make more bandanas+totes
plus *some* heart buttons + keychains but not sure which -- normally those take 3 boards so i'm going to cut down to 1

but if you want something specifically I'll bring it for ya! me: it's 2
mom: ..I love You!
mom: I don't know what you said but I responded with I love you. Honestly it’s hype rn but there are long time fans of the studio and people who it’ll just stick too..unless it’s gonna put you in a financial pinch I’d say follow your dreams friend. I’m biased cause I desperately wanna see and or own the mad burnish one. ok just one ticket left to halfalive tonight at paradise rock club in boston..its free...hmu. Or you can rephrase the question to “whose handwriting looks like a fifth grader’s” pic.twitter.com/5ex3hawVCS. You ever delay working on a seasonally themed comic for so long that the season passes then COMES BACK AROUND. GAH my sketchbooks are very consistently 3-4 months but I’ve just finished this one and i started it in APRIL? That’s..so miserable?! Or maybe not cause it means I was outside more or something ..

Oops I didn’t bring headphones for the T I’m such a n00b. LMFAOO OK the announcement sounded like gibberish to me but people got up and switched to the train across the way so I did that????? . I appreciate y’all taking the time to tell me what to wear tonight but it’s gonna be in the 40s so I said fuck mini skirts. I DONT KNOW ANYTHING ABT WIGS BUT I DONT NEED TO TO KNOW THIS IS REALLY GOOD it’s so?? Nuanced? Like every piece looks thoughtful..Amazing . Mom: is this lady wearing leather pants to the post office in the middle of day 
Me: hey she’s living her best life ok. wheeze anyone got good vinyl sticker place recs? I think my person is out of commission for the moment;;  also not stickermule pls thanks. It is the high holidays which means it is also

The audience was so giddy this last time — lots of giggling, woos and “gay rights!” for cpr/smooch — but most importantly: when Galo punched Kray in the face the crowd erupted in applause . what was it? Dhdjdjsb having the problem I always have which is “did I like this drawing better an hour ago?”

If any art friendos wanna give me their opinion please reply/dm  

Going to bed for now... It’s also hard trying to imagine it at 17” instead of the like 8.5” of my computer screen   I’m like is simpler better bc it’s better or when it’s at full size will the detail be good sndjdn. OHMYGOD   thank you for your service. oof i m*rdered my laptop last night it logged me out of everything. clearly they're f***ing. haven't u seen the discovery channel bro. woah..class is at the museum tomorrow..and then if i.....don't go to school on Yom Kippur..then there's Indigenous Peoples Day...... .. . not having class for a week and a half?? holy shit that'd be amazing..I'd still have to go in to screen print/riso but...(Eyes emoji).

Fjdnjds going by the Pru..Cheesecake Factory..I’m so hungry these are all just hunger tweets I guess. Crying bc I ended up at school anyway but I don’t have my files for riso or the energy for screen printing.  THANK YOU!! THEM!! I love this trio..cool leader and two rowdy boys. uhh i think i did that thing where i was thirsty but instead i just ate a lot of food. Thank you I’ve been looking for a tutorial like this for years. Ok gonna try to make my riso layers now send good vibes cause idk wtf I’m doing and I have to add trapping probably. YOU’RE ADORABLE. HHHHH anyone who does riso wanna look at this and tell me if this is anything (anything meaning..correctish??). pls i will give u the / a print for your troubles. y..yeah..;; or like..if there's a lot of black in the image and I broke it down like CMYK, should I be removing all the black areas from the other color layers or should I not use the black layer and have the overlapping colors make the black... Thank you so much! I did smth like that halftone method for screen printing in CMYK before! think I'm more nervous about if the registration is off it looking bad bc it's not like the lines are on 1 layer + theres color underneath - it's a total mess bc there's lines in lots of colors so like a line that's orange is on pink AND yellow layers, meaning more room for error. ..which one. hello if you've ever thought wow jenn your website is fucking impossible to view on mobile just know i've started working on that . very overdue but yeah. this??? is so unbelievably soft?????????????????? asANFMFL how could you tell me this???? ILL HAVE TO STAY AWAKE FOR WEEKS. Yknow like nya. I couldn’t not laugh at this reply but yes I love poking my pup’s canines!! I was waiting until swimming season was definitively over to use the purple overtone I’ve been hoarding the past few months — because I swam in the ocean and the pond at this time (and a bit later) last year —but it’s been so cold   I don’t think it’s gonna happen. I love him. HOW THE HELL DID I FORGET LIOS GLOVES AND WHY DIDNT ANYONE TELL ME. THE RISO LAB IS OUT OF PINK I FUCKING HATE THIS SCHOOL. I spent hours setting up and tweaking my files last night and they all involve pink I’m djfnddismdnddnGRRRRRE. Turning off notifications and going to the woods,,, today was supposed to be a break but here I am with emails and manus and sjshdhdh goodbye. this class I'm TAing being 1x a week is BAD. When I took it it was shorter 2x a week so if someone missed the point, was headed in a bad direction or just needed feedback you could get to them before they were too far gone. Instead we're dealing with lots of confusion and emails. me two weeks ago. BOY. THANK YOU!! I had so much fun with this! omg it's true I'm surprised at the lack of content for those two!! maybe I'm not following the right people haha. ok since my school has apparently been waiting on their pink ink for over three months, I submitted a request for a quote from a riso place nearby!! send good vibes. this place has a riso workshop at the end of the month and I'm eyes emojis so hard but $$ ; n; .........maybe if mice goes well..and there's still room..hn. cause I can 'watch' at school but i'm not allowed to touch the equipment LMFAOO so .. kinda hard to learn. Lrt this is practically my catchphrase at cons. Artist alley AND Thoughtful outfits?? Strong. I love animals but this bird comes and chirps outside my window at 7 AM EVERY FUCKING DAY at a nonstop high pitched single tone 90 beats per minute and i wanna cry. Can I also note this doesn’t happen year round but it does happen multiple times a year for weeks at a time for multiple years now. Me, not knowing how birds work: I bought you a nice house and put it way over there why won’t u use it. Lrt manspreading Lio framed my armored manspreading Lio ..this is galaxy brain at its best. Me last night at 2 AM listing to my mom everything I need to do for MICE. I was gonna not go to class today and work on stuff but an artist I like it giving a talk I feel attacked. Guessing it’s the prequel shirts! *shorts. Hdhdhdhd making new merch is the worst bc I’m like THATS WAY TOO MUCH then u gotta actually do the math ok how much each, ok how many would you have to sell to make back the cost of producing all of them, ok what’s the total profit you stand to make if you sell them all. Still torn between “that’s way too much” and “you only have to sell 8 to make that back, you can sell 8”. Sometimes my mom acts like she’s just discovering emojis again

It’s almost almost prompted by her saying she doesn’t want to /moooove/ followed by a cow pic.twitter.com/kqKgsuSyyZ. Thank you government for putting a fan in the bathroom for free but do you really need two separate guys to come look at it. GL to everyone doing regular AX sign ups!! I believe in you . I have 4,099 questions https:// twitter.com/RedSuitedLady/ status/1182003369998729218   …. I’M ROOTING FOR YOU!! Somewhat unintentional Yom Kippur fasting my head freaking kills tho. Congrats!!  See you there! There goes all my money~~. Keep waiting — after I think 10 minutes it releases the tables of people who didn’t finish filing out the form. I think it says sold out when they’re all actually gone. Friendly reminder to my friends who didn’t get an AX table yet that “unavailable” means some tables are still not completely check out - the ones that didn’t complete the checkout will go back up for grabs when the timer runs out! it will say “sold out” when they are all gone. I’m like 90% sure of this. Djsnshsb im pretty sure it’s ten minutes but people could X out in the middle I suppose or it could keep bouncing from person to person if none of them complete it?? Pretty damn sure tho. Ah well it did change to sold out. Shdbhddh I’m sorry :( maybe you can find someone looking to split. Ah, my bad then. There were like ten cashiers so I knew since I feel terrible today I’d get the hot guy and voila. Yeah I don’t know buddy. What the fuck I keep falling asleep. Ok fasting was a bad idea, I’m glad I didn’t go to school today jfndnfbf. I’m not really religious but I was like well I haven’t eaten for this long already, it wouldn’t be that hard to do the thing . I’m so sorry you went through this. Sending love . aa even with both eyes it was much easier to see details in the animation the second (cough, and third) time around!! I'm glad you enjoyed it tho!! # MLBS3Spoilers  Miraculous Spoiler

ready for my hot take? 
marinette w 1000 miraculouses > every kid in the goddamn show w a miraculous. can you believe it took 8 hours of sleep, a 2 hour nap, aleve, and until midnight for me to feel ok today..the hunger is finally kicking in
you're not supposed to work on yom kippur anyway i guess but gee whiz sure did have things to do today. THIS IS AMAZING. ADGDH THIS IS TOO KIND!! I do often take on too much... I do feel a lot better now so maybe I'll be productive tomorrow instead haha. I'M OK AND SAME AT YOU!!! omg motivated more like BURNT OUT!! You're making amazing things - I feel like I'm stunned by your artwork more and more lately!! WelcOME MY FRIEND . yesss oh my god I wanna see more of the burning rescue team and of meis and gueira too * U* They went to so much trouble to introduce all of them but so little screen time! Ah yes, October 10th, time to get ready for my 45th waitlist email from a**nyc. I missed replying to this but it made me laugh this morning. I never knew plastic owls were so popular until I delved into forums about this. yay! boonana fish charms shipped to me and should be here in a couple days and I'll send them immediately to y'all + the guy at the riso place is super nice and even gonna cut down my prints~. Just like him . This may just be the prettiest Lio I've ever seen! * U*. bruh ok so out ongoing hw is to make a collective list of art directors as a class and we're now a month in and I feel like throughout I've seen primarily white dudes and idk I'm surprised there's not more women at least..hn. lrt x2 tw body horror ? me: i need more days to get things done
also me: is it saturday yet (miraculous, bnha). "I want a lover that's...as good as Cady is...at...being a dog...WAit---" - me, failing to carefully word a sentence

(I'm trying to say I want to know a human that's as GOOD as Cady is like behavior/personality wise bc she's very well behaved and easy to care for fdgfDGFFHG). I spent forty years adding trapping so if this print looks bad I’m gonna cry. Omg this happened to me once I was like “this house is 10 mins away I could literally just drop it off” . Lrt ya I watched this movie 3x there is 100% no S/tar of David happening. like they said there are clear similarities to the holocaust, also imo POC being shot in the street, ICE, etc..but the movie is..very clearly anti-xenophobia...that’s literally the whole message. >  also same as that person I fed can’t speak to racism but they point out one guy is The Worst but feels like it shouldn’t be omitted that the other guy is on the rescue team. You’re 100% allowed to criticize the film and have your own opinions but don’t spread bullshit either, Thanks for coming to my ted talk. This got me so amped up I think because there are so many actual hateful things and people out there like go refocus your energy on those bruh. Yikes   well I met my bs on Twitter quota for the day already. Ps if you need to print at Lesley I can give u my login but I wouldn’t recommend it . Like damn I wanna see your promare art too but TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF. Wheeze ok. Anyway. Now that I’ve had my daily dose of Rage time to go fold some zines, fingers crossed. Oh shit these are so cute tho. THEY WOULD!! lrt some people just draw characters so?? charming?? idk how else to describe it. My mom is looking at the names in Peanuts and she goes “Hm Lucy van Pelt — do we ever find out what Charlie Brown’s last name is—-“. I want to snuggle a Lio plush but there is none and also if there were i do not have the currency with which to purchase it. Aaa thank you but yes I have!! Omg look how leggy Lio is, what a cutie..but I want a proper plush! Beggars can’t be choosers I suppose . Omg picture this —— Lio, meis, gueira omanjuu stacked in a triangle. me: oh tinf didn't update yet?
me: oh wait no they're just STILL MAKING OUT  

I mean after several years and hundreds of pages of build up they deserve this~. I LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF IT JUST SAYIN LMFAOO. I got /some/ things done today but honestly when it changes to cold like this my body desperately wants to hibernate..like the cold just makes me so sleepy. Goodnight pic.twitter.com/HiR8Fi6YSa. Yeah this is such a hot take. I don’t think I’ve ever turned someone down if they /ask/ to exchange or roll again instead bc I want them to be happy! Sometimes they’ll say oh I love them all except X And I’ll say ok I’ll let you reroll if you get that one. for multi rolls (3/5) I always say let me know if you get doubles+you can switch out least favorite...no one is sitting there rolling 10 times   def not “making tons of money” by cutting the price tag down to $6-8 vs 10   gambling/gacha addiction is a problem but this ain’t it. This must be it   I do really like bears too.. The internet sure does find smth new to be mad about every day huh. Ohh usually a**nyc meets their deadlines for waitlist updates but sends at like midnight but they missed it :o ..do I be that guy? Always get some stupid satisfaction out of banana fish merch going through NY  pic.twitter.com/PEfZwFNm8g. Me (singing Walk the Moon): when you are close to me, I shiver~~
Mom: when you are no-longer close to me, I shiva

# depressing Jewish jokes. Sbshshsh I was supposed to go screen print today but wasn’t feeling it but I was like “oh, if only the totes had come maybe I could have been motivated” —- but they did and were somehow unceremoniosuly shoved in our mailbox. LRT GIYUU WHAT IS THIS

AND LOOK AT THOSE CHOMPERS!!   . please burrito me in a blanket and wake me up in late April. THANK YOU aaa !! I’m printing these in riso I’m scared but excited! FLUORESCENT PINK! And it shows . Preparing for MICE has been a shitshow bc I didn’t sign/number/trim/sleeve my screen prints for uh what? 2 years? Also I have to price them. Hey! I will be bringIng a different and smaller selection for #MICE  - so if you want a specific item from my shop pls message me *in advance* so I can bring it for you! 

You can also purchase at  http:// cambrasine.art/shop    and select MICE Pick Up for shipping so you can grab and go! Dhnddhshsb called out. ok pricing my screen prints on a nonsense equation which takes into consideration the dimensions, edition size, how many pulls/colors and then I completely ignore all of that and price based on how much I like it or not. HHHH THESE TWO IN YOUR STYLE I swear. Lrt omg nejire is pouting??? ily. LRT TAKE ME THERE. They’re charming sketches tho!! Aww  I’ll look forward to it! Is this??? Comfortable?????? pic.twitter.com/rv1auxtClP. I’m hoping to have my mad burnish illustration as a riso print!! Should be picking them up Thursday and good to go as long as it comes out well!!   Probably the only promare thing I’ll have by next week tho. (Insert ain’t nobody got time for that meme)
Not sure if helpful but I submitted art for my orange acrylic charms from them 10/1, shipped 10/10, expected to arrive 10/14 (bc weekend). You can always try writing to them but za*p is....yeah. It’s not Inferno Volcano Margherita Mega Max —- but it’s pretty fucking good pic.twitter.com/5X40OxCpHm. Guy at Dunks gave me a chocolate glazed (no frosting) instead of double chocolate (FROSTING!!!), pour one out. thank you all for your sympathy. LRT

OHH now you got me curious.. i'm excited for bnha but i feel like first ep it'll be catch up/filler time yknow. aa I feel that! It's a tease one ep at a time haha. BIGGEST PET PEEVE WHEN I SORT BY COMPLETED AND THE AUTHOR GOES “eh whatever” HDNFKDNS. /pats you~~ . sdfgrdh screAM this came on after kwamibuster and honestly a pretty good summary of this show https://www. youtube.com/watch?v=AIFw0c o9ubo   …. zombie/frankenstein? witch? werewolf? skeleton friend? ; u;. ..spider. yes

Sound on for a bad joke pic.twitter.com/DQ7ls8s9zj. Thanks, I’ll take 98% of the profits . (jk I LOVE HIM THO). Sunset from Tuesday.. it was sooo beautiful!!

Also, rare glasses-on photo pic.twitter.com/GV93IK85K1. Now if only I could come up with ideas for my damn self . Oh my god I actually kind of love this. Made for you. Lrt fucking seriously. There were times I was worried about my ex struggling w addiction who was 7 hours drive away and I was like if he’s not in his right mind — or even if he is — will they just arrest or shoot him bc he’s not white? . Ok here I go, it’s three days past waitlist update date so catch me being “that guy” to a**nyc . YOU LOOK AMAZING 
I imagine they’d be hard to pull off but the horns really suit you!! Boonana fish charms /should/ be here tomorrow !!  anytime~. Still not 100% what a pin loop is but it looks cute. I bet my mom that she couldn’t be out of the supermarket by 5:45 and she wasn’t but in the end am I really the winner. Happy(?) Anime Recs? Honestly I started watching this years ago was like wtf and peaced out but people always recommend so maybe I should try again
Not that I go to anime for realism but I was like whys this lady cool w this alien guy just moving in. GREAT QUESTION...idk I like things like Hyouka, My Love Story, Orange,  Anohana (except the last two are fucking sad), etc...are those ..that. Ahsndjfn yes I adore this anime . Aa I watched Tanaka-kun, I think i watched one or two eps of Sakamoto so maybe I’ll pick it back up!! Thank you . To be fair sometimes it can take me like 6 eps to get into smth so maybe I just need to persevere. Hard to be productive lately cause I either A. have a headache then get tired or B. am tired then get a headache  . @ egoisticartist  time to play spot the main character pic.twitter.com/VdbZu0Nd8n.

And if so shouldn’t they have warned people? I ALMOST STEPPED ON HIM DJDBDHSBS pic.twitter.com/C9dtCvvZDG. .....(Sprinkles glitter and tinsel on it). do you think anyone who actually isn't a pervert ever gets those spam things where the "hacker" is like I'VE SEEN WHAT YOU LOOK AT AND WILL PUBLISH IT IF YOU DON'T GIVE ME $1000 and is like 'oh, couldn't be me~'? I saw one one time where they were like THE FBI IS COMING TO YOUR HOUSE --- unless you pay $500 rn over the internet and I was like yeah sounds legit. "Please send it to me. I do not want to publicly shame you, but I'll do it if I have to" * ~ just TA things ~ *. IT SHOULDNT TAKE THREE WEEKS AND THREE REMINDERS TO SEND ME A SINGLE FILE IS ALL IM SAYING.

My display is so tight that price stickers for screen prints are going on the top front corner instead of back bottom corner bc otherwise everything will get knocked over , don’t@me. Yeah . i used the purple stuff straight up on the brassier parts then diluted it for the silver-y parts and yet it looks....THE SAME. OHH I JUST SAW THIS!! Thank you so much for the compliments!!   I've always wanted to do a triangular composition and this was the perfect excuse!! :( pic.twitter.com/Jw1GkvpeHp. Aaa im just using overt*one daily pastel purple so it doesn’t claim to do more than it’s doing but..

Promare secret Santa except I don’t organize it. Me: no take ,, only throw. Ohh it’d be cool to do a thing where everyone starts from the same sketch but takes it to finish in their own way
I’m looking at a sketch a student sent and have such a clear image of how I’d do it + I know hers’ll probably look totally different then that bc I’m me and she’s her. omg the first sample bag had the pattern upside down so when I placed my order I was like HEY REMEMBER GOES THIS WAY + sent a thousand photos of the bag they sent me + they just sent me a fabric swatch pic (WHICH LOOKS V GOOD) but it’s oriented upside down in the photo I’m LMFAO.

I'M..GENUINELY VERY BUMMED OUT. Not like I thought everything was gonna be solved or anything but it was more of a downer than I anticipated. me: i want my art to look like this

Don’t ask me what that means cause idk but that’s the vibe I get...gueira on drums cause he cray...open to discussion..thanks for coming to my tedtalk. I mean it’s possible you really inspired one of these 45 people but. Yessss !! I feel like Lio needs to play guitar too cause what the fuck kind of music would they play otherwise... or holy shit what about a keyboard/piano (kakusei) ..would fit his rich boy thing too ..or electric violin?! a multitalented boyo. omg But it doesn’t have to have a huge dramatic plot it can totally just be band shenanigans. Sorry my brain ran away w this but if you follow through I’m excited to see what you make!!! I don’t wanna go to school tomorrow???? I’m busy???

LMFAO ok.. sh*ppingeasy was like FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS IF YOU'RE HAVING TROUBLE PRINTING - so I did and then No websites would load and system preferences would instantly be "not responding" but anyway I fixed it ...so now i'm back to just the original problem  fdsgfhgj.

Wanna actually draw something sometime
Send tweet. Uhhhhhh this guy I legit barely knew who asked me to prom when I was a sophomore (and then I met Joey so I turned him down) just messaged. LMFAOOO 
my brain: run
Me, reading through our conversations from 2013: maybe he was just nice and legit interested in me back then but I was head over heels for someone else so he never had a chance 
My brain again: bitch I said Run. i love Cadence very much but she's bad at using her nose to find things. she's been in every corner of the kitchen sniffing for chicken that's in the oven. aa the kny stage play actors look great, nezuko is soo cute!! excited to see inosuke sans boar head lmfao. Gonna try to get a lot of stuff listed that’s been missing from my shop before the holidays - clearance things, posters, screen prints, totes, etc. Very slowly adding some silkscreen things to my online shop!

Going through arts and craft bins that have not been weeded down since uh ever??? Elementary school??? pic.twitter.com/ub4zkkvdIC. ONE OF THE BIG DRAWERS WAS JUST MORE BUBBLE WRAP?! one day I will have completely eco friendly packaging but i'm still trying to use up things I have from us moving 1000 times !! aaa yes definitely!! I just didn't want people to be like "cool eco friendly mailers!!...yet my items are wrapped in tons of plastic?" LMFAO. Y’all ..can I condense two towers of shit into?? One??? Do you know how happy that would make me?? Ugh djdndj cursed!! I’m sorry you’re also experiencing this..last time we moved I gave my mom shit for buying tons of bubble wrap but I had no control lmfao. Update I forgot that one of the several reasons why I was going through these storage towers is bc I needed places to put the things that are currently everywhere..so I got the stuff that was in two down to one but I still need the other for now . Lrt gwaaahh I want a cool burnish outfit with a mask like this and a jacket w cool patches and an ita bag and  wahhh. Ok I know it’s 4 AM but once a month or so my hair gets stuck in my shirt and I think “should I cut my hair??” Then never do  pic.twitter.com/PGLFxfs8G6.

Good luck today! promare fandom is so horny, there's been a 300% increase of dicks on my TL 

I'm not mad at it but I do have to be more conscious on public transit. why are..all these files like..3 inches big.......the ones that are even at 300 dpi....kids..please... we should have given these students a template ..some are 300 dpi but 2" big and some are 72 dpi but 30". i just discovered  http:// booth.pm    ............... ITS AMAZING BUT OMG 1. Why did this take me so long and 2. OH NO MORE THINGS TO DESIRE. Taste: A

KnY you fool. matchy-matchy pic.twitter.com/1xcnZrJvGK. Yess, it’s such a nice palette ! WHAT A NEAT IDEA! if i could just learn to draw dragons i feel like the rest of my life would fall into place. the words of someone who loves Kirishima and Lio. NO ONE SAID ANYTHING ABT MY HAIR TODAY which is wild?? like that's fine but isn't there always /that one person/ who's like "!!! HEY!! THING IS DIFFERENT!!! I DRAW ATTENTION TO IT WHETHER U WANT OR NOT!!". Me literally yesterday: should I close my storenvy?
Storenvy just now: this absolute bullshit   Gotta love when companies increase rates and word it like they’re doing you a favor. pic.twitter.com/DaC2JCnH7i. Edited it  pic.twitter.com/2VLXhNFOHp. Oooh, I think I’ve seen someone I follow actually do this!! Sounds like a good time~. Aaa yeah, Photo shoots w friends in general sounds super fun but boudoir/~sexy~ like that can really boost your confidence too!! like looking at the photos after and being like “damn, I look like that ”. I think people bring their families there to eat, I think you’ll be fine . cuttieee~~ . SDGDFH THANK YOU SO MUCH!! I'm glad it arrived in good shape and to such a good reception!! TT A TT . LRT I AM ALWAYS SO FLATTERED (AND EMBARRASSED) BY PEOPLE SAVING MY PACKAGE DOODLES. lrt  :(. HNNN NANA!!! your soul eater art gets me every time . Depends what you’re going for but I saw that Lios hair is supposedly golden (disagree but ok trigger) so you could get a really pale yellow and dip dye it green if you’re not happy w the colors you’ve been receiving. Trigger: Lio is golden blond
Fandom: sorry can’t hear you—-. I have to teach the class to make repeat patterns which is gonna be INTERESTING bc some are very adept at photoshop, some know a couple things, some don’t even understand layers. I decided I’m gonna make my mom my first student and see how she does bc she doesn’t know photoshop.  there they are,,,   two pineapples. My prof already has a repeat pattern guide for the kids that is VERY thorough, so I thought I'd make one for the students who have good PS skills already + show them another step-by-step example. 

Quick+dirty, there's a million different ways/guides out there but here ya go~ pic.twitter.com/imZO3v67rv. If you want to be able to adjust the background color, doing this process with your elements on a transparent background is VERY VALID and recommended - but that's just not what I did here bc this was baby's first pattern. NO PROBLEM!!   Made for class so may as well post! The guide I was given as a student teaches about resolution, transparency, each Photoshop tool, etc. and if you're like me and already know Photoshop then you don't have time for that crap and it's way too lengthy LOL. just another disclaimer: this is my very basic breakdown of the steps I use. There's tons of ways, so if you're learning for the 1st time you may want to look for a guide that's more thorough, or look at a few +assess which process works best for you+what you're trying to achieve. > no fear
> angry people on the internet criticizing a quick guide I made for students to supplement another very thorough guide made by someone else
> one fear. NO ONE DID THIS BUT IVE SEEN IT HAPPEN. Aaa yes before I took the class I also always winged it and made “implied” repeat patterns    I’m glad you found it helpful!! THEY SMOOCH!! wow, it’s been a minute huh . Aaa there’s tons of tutorials online if you look for basic repeat pattern, but I’m glad this was able to give you the basic idea of how it works!!  Good luck!! Aaa no problem!! Yeah I looked at some while making this and I was like “too...many...words”   I know some people need that which is totally fair tho!! Hope it’s helpful to you! Aaa yeah it’s tricky to try and think like that.. Package doodles! I thought this hatsuharu was really cute.. pic.twitter.com/VsyZYLUlbb. Ahah I feel the same way! The detailed one was helpful the first time but after that it was way too much to sort through to find the actual steps, so this is a good refresher!! Glad it’s helpful to you!! S..SINCE Y'ALL LIKED THAT.. more basic pattern tutorials coming your way lmfao. OK y'all liked my basic repeat overview, so here's one for half-drop!

Disclaimer: This is a very basic overview of the steps I use. There r other ways. If ur learning for the 1st time, u may want to look for more thorough guide, or look at a few+assess which process is best 4 u pic.twitter.com/SdUMFRv3IC.

Took them 23 days, a phone call, and two emails to review my appeal and get a “go fuck yourself” from the financial aid office. Fuck this place honestly .

Tuition costs shouldn’t double in the time you’re attending a school. Lesley. If my scholarship is prorated for how many credits I’m taking then where the Fuck is my scholarship!??!

It means a lot coming from your bc I adore your little comics,, they sustain me   I hope you enjoy the fic too!! Broke: wordless comics to be artistic and leave room for interpretation

I mean it’s still a mess but. In addition to whatever sale I run for Black Friday weekend I’m gonna have a listing of random bonus things I’m trying to clear out - overstock, last ones, imperfect, and vintage  cambrasine  merch I have unearthed - some may be free w order or heavily discounted like $1-5. Cleaning/sorting is a nightmare I decided at 10:30 I’d clean off this one section and it’s 3 hours later and it’s not clear 
There’s just always smth else that needs reorganizing in order to put each thing away and it just is. A lot. I found cool holographic tissue paper while cleaning. Daylight savings time saved my ass from going to bed at 3. LRT I LOVE THIS BUT ALSO LIO B CAREFUL where tf are ur skate guards bro. Lrt winter outfits are cute but you won’t survive winter in MA in a sweater and ankle length pants . all kewpies are cursed...... I have Deku pic.twitter.com/IIsiNh6kvP. Aaa actually a friend got him for me!! Probably try the usual yahoo auctions japan, mercari, etc. I’ve seen them on eBay but they’re v expensive on there except Todoroki. Finally caved+made a nsfw @cambrassinning 

Notes
  Will prob keep suggestive/pg13 over here like I’ve been?
  probably just retweeting explicit stuff, not drawing 99% of the time 
  sometimes kinky, multiship, I’m not picky
  if ur underage I will kick ur ass+call ur mom thnx. Fuck me I just realized the school will probably write back to me during class tomorrow and Idk how to not get super upset..I can’t even just not check my email cause I’m always in there sending and receiving messages to/from students. There was a lot of time today where I just moped around and I could’ve been drawing but I didn’t so. There’s a difference between Resting or Doing Other Things You Enjoy (which is Necessary and Good) and just not being productive but also not relaxing either and just scrolling and refreshing endlessly and feeling bad yknow. Ahdhdhd I follow her!! Honestly she’s gorgeous, she’s always made up and lounging at glamorous places, her art is also beautiful and apparently sells like crazy sometimes I’m like IS THIS REAL LIFE ??? Next time someone asks me where I wanna be in ten years I’ll just send them her@. Lrt oh.mygod. I’m so bad at plants that this poor mofo is trying to yeet himself out of his pot to get away from me pic.twitter.com/8PSUDK2nSD. told my prof about the school situation and she said 'don't let it get to you cause you don't need it (school)' LMFAOOO. Wheeze she was empathetic and said she’d be exhausted too. she said having a semester off wouldn’t be the worst thing and also teaches at the other school I’m gonna look at for fall.. but if I take the semester off (by force or choice) I have 0 way to pay for this fall tho. me: i don't forsee any issues in the future
me internally: and i intend to leave this cursed establishment anyway. i love them. tw abuse / 
casually reading how to cut ties w toxic family bc reasons + there's WAY too many comments from kids saying they're being abused + people being like 'wait til your 18' or 'get a job and save'

i won't pretend to know the first thing but that cannot be the solution. I passed on You*macon for a few reasons but would like to try in the future but I've seen like half the posts are saying it was disastrous and ridiculing it and the other half saying it was AMAZING and RECORD SALES and I'm just like ???? absolutely what happened. I’m losing it over the line weights —- so good . Lmfaooo scam calls are so stupid it’s like bruh if I committed a federal crime I think something would happen other than a robot leaving a voicemail saying we need to talk. IT IS SEXY. Last night
Me: fuck this I’m going over her head her last email literally just said “I can’t do that” and it’s been days - I’m sending this email if she doesn’t reply by noon tomorrow!
Noon
Me: maybe I should wait am I being unfai——. Jennie ends up in another unhealthy relationship that makes her question herself and her sanity but this time it’s with LE*SLEY UNIVERSITY. Next panel leaked!!!  

(shdndjdjfn lemme know if u want me to delete this, I’m sorry) pic.twitter.com/lDr70cmg4w. SERIOUSLY I still can’t figure it out and I wanna know if I should try next year or not. UPDATE I DID IT I EMAILED THE PERSON OVER HER HEAD!! END ME NOW pic.twitter.com/PBDzDLH3Il. LMFAOO between promare and starfighter my brain is just There. wHAT. OH WAit is it cause -- Etsy's 'sort by most recent' search is inherently flawed by like -- when someone purchases one of an item, it's "relisted" and therefore becomes "newest" -- so since people couldn't purchase yours its at the end? Don't quote me on absolutely any of that -. OH wait sorry you're not talking about sorting by most recent though you're talking about regular search...that blows.. i'm sorry. Uhhhhhhh just occurred to me that we may or may not (it’s still ? Bc $) be away from Thanksgiving thru the first week of Dec for my bro’s graduation — a window of time which includes annual Black Fri-Cyber Mon sale so..

May decide differently but curious what y’all prefer! destashing craft supplies that literally have just been sitting in drawers for years..feels so good.... also cause i n eed money hahahah..ha. not that $20 is gonna pay for college but. Holy shit that’s adorable. Steak and cheese  izza pic.twitter.com/roaTGN15vZ. LMFAOOO IT HAS WHITE SAUCE AND MULTIPLE KINDS OF CHEESE ON IT I PROMISE!!!  omg. I literally couldn't tell how much sauce I was putting on it bc the color was so similar to the uncooked dough . Mom@Cady: Why don't you play with your toys like other dogs?
mom + I, in sync: ""I'm not /like/ other dogs~~". I know this is not supposed to be the big takeaway from this but —- Landon’s pants . Depending on how big they are you could also look into rigid mailers! Just tried to shorten “twinkies” and it becomes twinks and —. SHDBDHDH Oh my. Oof maybe rolling is best then   Good luck!! I’m sure people will want to buy online regardless of shipping cost . Wheeze feeling so drained today but dragged my ass into the city for class. There is...no resemblance to the main or really any banana fish characters...this happens tho. One time I pointed it out and they were like “I’ll still buy it, cause it makes me think of that character anyway” So to each his own . Aaa I’m so glad it arrived safely!! And just in time too!!   Thank you for your support . /vibrates FANNY PACKS AND MAILING SUPPLIES SHouLD BOTH ARRIVE TOMORROW!!! I'll post an update tomorrow (just waiting to make sure everything's good) and give last call for address changes~. I'm looking through the artists for myself and saw this may be one for you! https:// bandagebrigade.com /  . Yeah..I just..want a yes or no answer...it shouldn’t be so impossible . lrt same, lio, same. BIG MOOD DANI   *~free ourselves of old merch vibes~*. Haven’t looked into it but knowing how it is making linking charms, I imagine shaker charms must be expensive to make.. It’s 9:30 but I’m so tired I haven’t been productive at all . Gonna?? Go to sleep? See y’all at like 3:00 probably lol. MY BODY..U PREDICTABLE LITTLE BASTARD. SHE DIDNT WRITE BACK FOR FOUR DAYD SND THEN SHE STILL DOESNT ANSWER MY QUESTIONS BUT EMAILS ME TO PAY MY BILL THAYS NOT DUE TIL THE 15th I’m gonna djndnffnf. I even left her a voicemail yesterday like u gotta be kidding lady. friend..................i'm ON THE EDGEEDGSFDGf. Starting to get clearance listings ready for the sale later this month!! I know myself well enough to know if I don't do it now I won't do it at all LMFAOO. THATS ADORABLE. i left it up to fate ...Individually wrapped items kill me bc plastic but also.....not having to individually wrap/fold each fanny pack.....................................is happiness. Fanny packs have arrived! Here’s a informal video comparing the sample to the finished version! 

Kickstarter packages will be going out soon (check the latest update for info!), and if you missed the KS you can still grab one at  http:// cambrasine.art/shop-all     pic.twitter.com/DFeBIE4IgZ. DFGFH THANK U FRIEND,,,,. KS will take care of just under half the stock, but if anyone knows any artist/kawaii-style stores that may be interested in consignment/stock  hmu ;). YES!! They had REALLY good reviews, so I trusted them and it paid off aaa! When they sent me a photo of the sample fabric vs the bulk order I was like yESSS . mood - the only reason mine almost exactly covered expenses was bc it went over the goal  I know people whose KS rake in thousands but all that $ goes into making stretch goals and adding goodies so they don't come out with profit. i care him. also between KS and processing fees literally 10% is gone instantly! And that they count shipping towards your goal is total bullshit - that money's gone already too! LMFAOO THINGS WERE GOING TOO SMOOTHLY FOR A MINUTE
 
me a week ago: (doesn't question why my order is so inexpensive)
me receiving the package: I have made Multiple Mistakes. Just sent off a few things to try to get my work out there!  Rejections are disappointing but you’ll never know if you don’t try! THANK U DANI. Cancelled . (PS I always forget how fucking adorable your dog is,, I love her). (strategically throws darts at wall)
something,, stick!!! Horny, but also cute! I think context is important . HOLY CRAP!! That’s amazing!! I can’t get over their limbs. LMFAOO no way, it’s not that racy! Really just unfollowed an artist for?? Being kind of a dick? Like idk just don’t be a dick??? It felt so unnecessary. Giving criticism that isn’t asked for: bad

Straight up just being fucking publicly mean????: bye. Yeah....save being a dick for the confines of your brain or private like the rest of us . LMFAOO that’s a whole ‘nother side account . I have been asking myself about lios various stages of undress so much lately I gotta take fucking notes at redux. Meanwhile follow your heart?? Lio doesn’t have gloves in my print cause I forgot :) and then I didn’t add them cause it was gonna be hard :). Me, writing in a notebook in the dark theater: “1 hr 10 minutes, tiddies out”. not sure why I'm so disoriented about what day of the week it is?? I feel like I have class but I don't til WEDNESDAY bc of the holiday...blessed. decorate an entire christmas tree with them. same it's got me wondering do i not have seconds enamel pins or do I just not know what to look for. HOLY SHIT that'd be pretty amazing actually. RIGHT like I can tell if theres like...a dent in it or smth but otherwise i'm like??? yep??? looks???? ????????????? ???????????????????????? OHH CONGRATULATIONS!! SAME.. and just in general this is how people function like i'll be like ITS GOT THIS SMALL ERROR DO U WANT IT FOR HALF PRICE And people are like bro what error. Someday I’ll have money and hire people to photograph my products . MEANWHILE YOU GET WHAT YOU GET. Ohhh!! That sounds so nice! There’s DIY guides too but I’m stubborn . Update I have a very untrained eye but I think they look pretty good? It’s so fun when you can immediately recognize who owns a side fan art or nsfw account bc of their style... feels like you share a secret or smth sweet~ . That said if they chose not to write their main/identity then be respectful and keep your mouth shut . I totally get ya! I still like trying new things but in general it’s a huge pain for display, packing/travel, storage etc and often times people will be like “WOW THATS SO COOL” then put it down and buy a button or keychain instead anyway   you learn what works for you and sells. Agreed! And critique should be constructive?? “I hate this” isn’t doing anyone any favors, just spreading negativity which we have enough of in the world and making a real human somewhere frown. ...GO T O SLEEP??????????? lrt dunno what's going on but it looks cool. Sick of this yet?  The bulk order of fanny packs is finally here~ The print quality is improved and the inside lining is now FULLY PINK! 

If you missed the Kickstarter, you can still grab one at  http:// cambrasine.art/shop-all    or at some con, sometime

Excited to get these out to ya! pic.twitter.com/6BkTlnuaYO. I’m just waiting on the bonus stickers!! I’m so antsy to get these into your hands (and out of my living room cause the box is too heavy to move rn  ). I agree, I just rewatched this disturbing ted talk on sleep it was BAD. Aaah yeah shaker charms look cool and also the new holo acrylic material and holo bags...cOOL!! But sometimes you just have to wait for an idea to strike yknow. 
Ah yeah it’s nice to relax and not worry about having to be on the cutting edge all the time!! Tldr sleep keeps u alive. If you’re like me and you feel bad about sleeping sometimes because you “have things to do,” just watch this and etch it into your brain 

 https:// m.youtube.com/watch?v=5MuIMq hT8DM   …. Anytime bud (ps Here’s the thing if u wanna feel ever worse about not sleeping  https:// m.youtube.com/watch?v=5MuIMq hT8DM   …  ). I never got more ear piercings bc a million years I made the mistake of bringing it up to my mom while at lunch with my grandma and yknow. old people. and YEARS LATER I STILL WANT THEM BUT IM AN EVEN BIGGER SCAREDY CAT. THERE'S SO MANY KINDS THO I'm overwhelmed. aaa maybe when my brother's home this winter! he's good at pushing me, gently haha
ohh thank you for the rec!! * U*. looking at all these piercings reminded me how goddamn squeamish I am.. Industrials are cool!!  * U* I'm trying to decide hypothetically what I'd want..maybe helix? or just a second lobe..hm. THEY LOOK SO GOOD!! I love lio's long pieces..like bunny ears..super cute!! ; u;. Sent out an update yesterday but KICKSTARTER BACKERS: You've got 48 hours to make any address changes! 

Also if your reward includes charms - I /may/ have forgotten to put attachment preferences on the surveys - Pink phone straps default, message for lobster clasp or ball chain. Here’s your vintage illustration inspo for the day pic.twitter.com/7CHYWBnayE. (Blows nose)

Ah, how seasonal. Photo of my dog realizing she can see the driveway from my room pic.twitter.com/WSgr1PJZNC. uhhh ok once again which should i watch first??
miraculous is gonna be a fucking acid trip I can tell 
bnha has MY BOY THIS WEEK!!!! WHY IS MIRACULOUS SO DARK
honestly. Yeah it's really not cool....just like when there were issues last year and twitter updated but not the site for a while...big sigh. BIG SIGH>. Miraculous spoilers #MiraculousLadybugSeason3

Gabriel: I’m doing this for us!!!
(Dropkicks his son). SERIOUSLY i feel like season 3 half I'm like 'so cute!' and half i'm like 'ABSOLUTELY WHAT THE FUCK JUST HAPPENE----' and there is No In Between. OHMYGODD. Multi religion holiday dessert menu circa me in 2003 pic.twitter.com/1c03KcdVf1. anime b*ston: it's the 9th!
anime b*ston: go fuck yourself it's the 16th now
anime b*ston: (puts it up on the 9th). i am ,, ,enraged,,,, year after year. also is it just me or are the prices WAY up from last year. it's not /as drastic/ as I thought bc they went up last year too but felt that way because they had been the same for 3 or so years before. so between this year + last up 35% ($100 - $135  and $200 to $270).. if only organization had also improved 35% rip. thanks for coming to my semi-annual A*B organization bitch-fest. i know this yet every year some small part of me hopes maybe, /just maybe/ there won't be MULTIPLE PROBLEMS

you also didn't experience the trying to get a table on-site extravaganza - I promise it was just as misinformation riddled. HONESTLY I keep getting confused trying to do little package doodles of him vs shorter bc i'll start drawing the others' hair. I have so many plush so a few months back I went through and donated a lot of them.

Then just now I pulled out the bin I store them in to see if there were more I wanted to donate and my knee-jerk reaction was "wow! there's so much room in here! for more stuffed animals!". LMFAOO IFEEL LIED TOO All the kirishima's this week were in the preview..but holy shit next episode looks like HIS TIME!! I AM EXCITED!!! YES ITS VERY HARD TO FIND PLACES If you're looking local then I'm like 90% sure Savers will take them but if you have the $ to mail them: https:// stuffedanimalsforemergencies.org/urgent-needs  . we sent some to Teddy Bear Brigade and some to Santa Fe Medical Center - doesn't look like the latter is on the list anymore but you can email and ask ghesch@phs.org. LMFAOO ,, THE LINE IS BLURRING
omg you're right I didn't even realize. OH YES I MEANT THAT -- well it all worked out but my friend and I were emailing them before that about /when, where, etc./ and they told us different days/times, ended up saying friday morning, then gave out tickets on thursday night and I was gonna FLIP. yeah fcfs (while I'm generally good at it) was not good for many reasons...but they're just.........there's always..problems. lrt me: what a nice thing on the internet!
the internet: actually it's awful
me: pic.twitter.com/vu5mdi7UwU. no problem friend!! <3. I'm going to be no help on the color but ohmygod that's a lucky group of middleschoolers!! don't RT / to be deleted but sometimes I forget Miraculous has been around for four years already! My art used to look like this pic.twitter.com/5cNuaZwbj3. these songs still make me laugh https://www. youtube.com/watch?v=FArZxL j6DLk   …. I was on the computer and drawing a lot and yet..wrist pain on my non dominant hand??? Wyd. Ok for context my mom had an eBay addiction in the 90s and as a result we own hundreds on beanie babies which I have just finally today convinced her to go through ffs pic.twitter.com/zmRut8fJVA. UPDATE SHE JUST MOVED THEM ALL (and by all I mean the ones out of the storage unit --- not at all the ones we own) into one giant bin without going through them bc 'that's a whole day's project' i'm crying. Ok this game is open indefinitely — 1 guess per person!

W the context of my moms 90s eBay problem: Guess how many beanie babies we have. Total. Big ones, normal ones, happy meals.

Winner gets a sense of satisfaction, bragging rights, and idk I’ll send smth u want from my store. The game ends when I have the answer. That could be in two days or two years

but hopefully sooner rather than later, pray for us. Me: (reading my mom this tweet)
Mom: theyre beanie babies and the big ones are beanie buddies.
Me: h—
Mom: and the little ones are teenie beanies 
Me: shut the fuck up. Lrt angel,,, also they’re drawn p cute here. Somehow you’re the first one to say this. Upon their invention (93/4) until probbbaaablyy ... sometime before the divorce in 02? We def don’t have every one from that time but we do have multiples of some . KICKSTARTER BACKERS! Third and final reminder to update your address before midnight EST tonight! 

That said I would never maliciously send your package to the wrong place if you message me after this deadline but it will make my life harder so be kind . They gave me two toys by accident and honestly I’m keeping onix pic.twitter.com/YzVGAdHrPG. Yep!! I didn’t photograph it tho. Boston Art Bo*k Fair is rad, I didn’t really understand what it was like a couple years ago and the timings not usually good bc AAC/anyc  so I think I turned it down but hopefully I can apply and table next year! “Bye”

You’re welcome :). feel confident about the pattern making part of my demo but
some of these students REALLY don't know photoshop
so like do I..also teach them select / cut / paste / move .........or maybe just individually help the less digitally-inclined so we don't waste time on basics. I d*ied making a tutorial with lots of screenshots for the non-digitally-inclined students.. I hope they appreciate it ....will relax when this project is over. KS progress~ put together all the clay charms, now importing the addresses. camouflage pic.twitter.com/mjEHVqt7Bo. current potential plan is go to NY friday morn, just have fun if I don't get a last minute table, stay over fri night.........maybe... you ever input 40 addresses by hand bc you don't wanna pay $15 to be able to import a spreadsheet then realize you'll be over your monthly package limit and have to pay the $15 anyway. I'M FINE I Am...Fi..ne. Aa yeah I think anyc is a good one to break after - perfect holiday timing - and it’s not that the con itself is more overwhelming than others but I always feel more overwhelmed bc I feel that way every second I’m in NYC . Quick someone give me like $2,000 to make original merch ——. Jk could be a cute Kickstarter for spring tho :o timings bad rn anyway and I wanna chill for a bit too ..I say that yet I always find smth to stress myself w . haha just kidding..unless? Words to live by. I had promare merch idea but I have $0 and no pin manu. Me: is this (dog drawing) cute?
@grimmfirefly : why no cat 
Me: shut up I also drew a cat
@grimmfirefly : why no raccoon?
Me: SHUT UP I ALSO DREW A RACCOON. Me: I’ll start sorting the beanies (drags tub up the stairs)
Mom: why don’t you just start w the ones under your bed
Me: oh no pic.twitter.com/hcmjlEy4ly. If y’all wanna revise your guesses speak now . I.. I think I have laid out.....all of them,..................but my mom insists we are missing some.... I forgot these existed pic.twitter.com/yw7PGyzbU4. The idea is really reliant on the metal material, it won’t work the same as a sticker  I’ll think on it more haha. Peak 90’s. I KINDA LOVE THEM. There were a couple more too!! Wild. THESE ARE FAKES BTW omg ..... WHAT IS HAPPENINg. Before and After Contouring pic.twitter.com/9xC1m1S7DP. TALLYING NOW! Last call!!! https:// twitter.com/cambrasine/sta tus/1193433354986754049   …. Ding ding ding! Winner! The final count was 360 (UNFORTUNATELY FOR ME HAHA...)! I’ll DM you tomorrow for prize https:// twitter.com/smply_sktchng/ status/1194009947165446145   …. CLOSED! Thanks for playing! Sending my bro batches of beanies I don’t want in case he does and we have such different tastes that we’re gonna end up keeping so many . THESE LOOK SO GOOD I HOPE U SELL THEM ALL. Not sure if I’m too late but here are my kids in case any catch your eye!   Hope you have fun with whatever you draw~ pic.twitter.com/iWDTpqLzbp. Oof all it takes is one good migraine to decimate your already bad sleep schedule
2:41..time to start the day. I opened my bedroom door and cady barked and I spilled my water so off to a good start LOL. ugh sorry buddy. I only had one day off but I became so directionless and couldn't remember what day it was this is why I can't take a semester off LMFAOO. me: The scratch disks are full!! I'M TRYING TO MAKE IT SMALLER SO THEY AREN'T FULL
mom: who's giving you trouble?! your prof? or some kid?
me: ...Photoshop. Pretty pic.twitter.com/pP9DwepAhF. so sick of people taking credit for other creators' work :(. Ondjdjdbd so pleased with herself,,. They’re all great but Rengoku is a goddamn masterpiece haru. Weeps I made holindaise sauce and bc I cant multitask in the kitchen it totally broke apart in the time I did everything else fjdnfjd. It looked so good for like five minutes. Must be related to Cady . # miraculousspoilers  #miraculousseason3

There’s an artist near me w lots of lewd art so they have a whole wall of prints on the side that are censored by sticky notes and I saw someone pull one off, quickly photograph the bj underneath, and replace it snHFNDLFN. I’ll keep my eyes peeled! I just saw the one you had today was off hold but then I think I saw someone walk by w it . (I posted bc I thought this was hilarious but also con etiquette: please ask the artist before taking photos). BDNDJSNDND yes well maybe they wanted to see that specific one. Oops   just realized I’ve been undercharging on an item all weekend fjdnfj. OH NOOO I took a break bc I was overwhelmed from the arcade noise fjdnfn. Omg. Omg !! Yes!! Thank you!! Sorry I’m functioning at 5% LMFAOO. Aaa thank you!   I love it too (obviously haha). I don’t think I’ve ever in my life seen a Given cosplayer at a con?? ! Lukanette in the wild pic.twitter.com/nh1PgJ5Ke1. Agreed! Aaa thank you!! I hope you had a good day! OH NO!! They were like “this information is too valuable!!”. AAA I MISSED THIS but thank you friend!!  I hope kumoricon is going well!! I hope to try it sometime!

My mom recklessly accepted three large bills today without the counterfeit pen so send good vibes . i am downloading,,,, THE KIRISHIMA EPISODE. SHDBDHDSJNDFUCK I took this picture to be like “my ideal evening” and now it looks like I’m trying to have dinner with him i—— pic.twitter.com/07YPoRczvh. I’ve shown my true form: I’m now that person who sits my anime body pillow at the dining table.  i'm!! happy to see him too!!! Sometimes I wish my work could reach more people - then I see popular artists getting hate mail from “fans” for not being able to meet demand, having everything they say overanalyzed, getting their work ripped off by factories+giant corps, etc and I think nah I’m good for now . Lrt why won’t my brother drop everything and drive two hours to get me a Lio doodle. Aaaa I didn’t see you!! It’s so funny I was thinking earlier today “that whole crew is missing!” . So glad you had a good time!! I’m tired I think I was mindlessly rubbing my back on the doorframe like a cat. Mom: i bet the Walmart would have had the money detector
Me: ...did u mean Walgreens and counterfeit pen. Hey boy.. pic.twitter.com/nxt8pBiYdE. Me, watching SNL on TV, while in NY: wow!!!!! w w w hat who does this at the bathroom near me there’s literally like 30 people in line sometimes.

Anyway if u wanna have a fucking weird experience put on PBS bc all the background music is intact but there’s zero sound of narration or human speech. Update they fixed it but that was bizarre and made me feel like I was losing my mind. just imagining trying to photograph my anyc haul.......FRIENDS NEW AND OLD ARE WAY TOO GOOD TO ME. I wish I had asked a few new artists to trade with me but in the end I'm STILL SHYdfgfdhg just wasn't in a good state w lack of sleep but maybe next time i'll be braver!! Smdndjdn I feel you bud..I feel like unfortunately sometimes u just gotta wait for inspiration to strike to make cool new shit, forcing it will prob just result in some weird result?? LMFAOO it was too obvious and I wasn’t gonna let u give me stuff without returning the gesture!! Part 1 of my #animenyc  #anyc  haul!This is just from Friday and Saturday buy/trade but we went a little trade crazy on Sunday so get ready for the next one

Middle aged people at this café talking about their friend who is trans and?? Doing a good job at it? It’s really nice. Ohmygod pic.twitter.com/VopsEUV9zt. Did I hallucinate this tag happening a couple months ago too? Anyway—

Here’s a weird variety of photos of me ! #2009vs2019 pic.twitter.com/iM6yHBjx9w. “Take me to your home, human”. Can’t believe I have to travel 2 hours total just to flip through a slideshow while my prof talks to a group full of kids who largely have already took or are currently taking her class . Lrt there he is. THERES A COMBINED 182 SLIDES. i can't play swsh but Nickit is very cute I love his lil markings. It's also like not what it's supposed to be about so I tried to tell her what they'll expect her to speak on and she was like 'are you saying the presentation is irrelevant?" and the answer is NO but KIND OFdfsgHGJ. sdfgdh I feel like i've always looked the same but I feel like I look really different in each of these photos LOL. Sorry for the kinda crappy print outs in these KS packages! I don't want to delay shipping any longer but I ran out of biz cards this weekend!;;. It’s feel bad hours over here bc we are officially not going to see my bro for thanksgiving and his thesis defense/graduation due to a combination of various shitty circumstances dndjdnfn. US fanny pack only rewards are going out tomorrow for sure, will see how many others I can get done after dinner;;. i feel bad cause even tho we didn't riskily put out a chunk of money we can't afford to we did lose some money on change fees/refunds and I also feel bad cause HE feels bad but it's not his fault he prob won't finish in time, even if he did we couldn't realistically afford to go. haha whoopsies turns out scan forms are a ~~~premium~~~ feature that shit is $29, sorry local USPS workers you're just gonna have to scan them individually hsdgfdrhf. I .. I WAS EXCITED TO SEE WHAT PERCENTAGE OF PACKAGES I GOT OUT cause I thought it was most and it was 47% ...............not bad for one evening tho when i'm not at PEAK PERFORMANCE haha  prob won't finish until Thursday bc of class > A<. Anyway I stuck my sleeve in ketchup (not a little bit - like a solid 4 inches of ketchup) at dinner and this many hours later I’m still wearing the same shirt and still have a paper towel up the sleeve so I feel like that gives u a good read of where I’m at rn—-. Yeah..it’s stupid bc they’re not inconveniencing me so much as the postal workers :/. # anyc  #animenyc  haul part 2 of 3  Bought w couple of these but this is like 90% trades... it’s so lovely to have made so many friends in AA that we always end up with hauls like this   tagged the taggable + @aiboneida  AND HELP ME FIND TASSLE INOSUKE ARTIST PLEASE!! pic.twitter.com/gKAQgzz3yo. if you’re uncomfy fudge the reason but I think it’s important to tell them what u did bc it might matter yknow... also sometimes if u can’t explain to them how u got hurt they might suspect abuse and that opens a can of worms but that’s just my two cents   sending u good vibes! Alright my new neighbors moved out here from the city and now they’re legit just cutting down half the trees on their property did y’all fuck up or what. Hdbshdhd we bathe Cade outside when it’s warm enough but now she’s returning to the groomer and she was so scared since it’s been long   ...also the lady there always calls her Candance LOL. dsgesh barely awake i think i've yawned half a dozen times and the prof isn't even here yet. !! cONGRATS! Make bank friend. Ok the packages I did are at the post office but the worker refused to scan them and just put them in a bin even tho there were 0 other people in line but ok buddy . Fuck that place the other location always scans in front of me and gives me a receipt. You know when you’re being cranky and you know you’re doing it but you’re still,,, cranky. i got an anon tumblr ask today which blew my mind bc I can't tell you the last time I was on there but I did answer it -- and they called me jennie so I'm guessing maybe you're from here which is why I'm tweeting this!! thank you for this cursed content. whAT. safsgdh  no one asked for that but ok game freak you do you LMFAOO. dsfgfg my bro sent pics of a mug he made and my mom started telling him the cost of flights and i got VERY CONFUSED and thought she was like pricing it for him or bidding on it or smth insane. LRT THE RESULTS OF THIS POLL ARE STRESSING ME OUT. these results..i feel attacked. CADY IS GRUMBLING AT ME I wish I could make her understand that she'd die if she ate this. lrt

> figure our how to wear all my promare merch to redux 
> that’s it that’s the only important thing. Just found my passport card in a pile of Pokémon cards. This is a good yankee swap gift. Oh. Finally got in touch w her after several weeks but she was so sick we had to explain the situation to her three times..the saga continues...will Jennie be in school this spring? Tune in next month to find out. I thought I had it bad being next to the arcade but then I saw an artist whose table was back to back with a smoothie vendor, BLENDING. Omg I wasn’t near it but the smell would waft over several times a day, i didn’t get any and I can’t help but wonder if it was good. Hey hey I have lots of anyc friends right? Since I got a table last minute I prob won’t get the AA feedback survey, could someone send it to me when it’s out? LMFAOO yeah one person came by my table was on the verge of a mental breakdown bc they couldn’t find the vendor . Djdjhdj that would cause me so much anxiety..even getting a sample sometimes u get smth different in the big order and you’re like ??? So to not even get one and get other people involved....eep. They do look really cute though..I hope everything works out for them even tho it’s moderately reckless fjdnfn. Hey hey any mutuals/friends need heart buttons? V last minute, would need files by tomorrow night. I’m out right now but I will when I get home! apologies to whatever poor a*nyc person who has to read my four paragraphs of feedback but please do smth about the organization of that giant hall, for everyone's sakes. depending on where you were it wasn't *that bad* for most people but it definitely wasn't ideal to have the AA so spread out, with food vendors randomly in the middle and loud activities (ddr, concert, etc.) directly next to some artists;;. LRT FUXKIJG ME oh my god. ESDHDGFG good luck friend~ you got this!!! LMFAOO YEP! I feel like everyone I talked to said the same thing but it's important to really drive it home. i have many questions and all of them are 'wait, what?!'. hello i've accomplished almost nothing today. designercon always sounds so interesting! best of luck!! me: ok I should name this folder with the month
me: (looking at the full written date and thinking really hard about which part)
me: ...Th..ursday. adfsdg i need to make actual promare merch but meanwhile................ heart lio button from that /one drawing/ i did? LOOL... I just.. /I/ want one. me: I'm not gonna do that bullshit where I pretend I'm gonna make new button designs
me, 5 minutes later: (drawing new button designs). mom: I'm having jennie problems
me: what does that mean?!
mom: I can't open this
me: THAT'S RUDE AS HELL--

my weakness, broadcast. At the people who are iffy on playing Pokémon: just give me your switch, I’ll take care of this —. momijiiii~~ i love a bunny boy!!! thank you, my mailing address is---. Stared at this thing I was excited about for weeks and now I hate it..drawing is an interesting experience. I MADE A BOY .......
  He's been added to my Fruits Basket heart button set@ http:// cambrasine.art/shop-all     pic.twitter.com/YAQ2AggdpU. ABDBFJDN I STArted laughing before I even opened the page bc I remembered where we were 
But oh my god the second brow really drove it home huh. Also, this image is borrowed from my full illustration, but I'm making a little Lio heart button because.. FRANKLY, I WANT ONE FOR MYSELF! But there's a minimum quantity so feel free to hop on the Lio-Loving wagon ;) We can match!

 Preorder him@ http:// cambrasine.art/shop-all     pic.twitter.com/0V6cbWAPWp. Promise I’ll make some legit promare merch sometime, merch artists just spiraled out of control before I finished my drawings so I thought I’ll need to make something more unique than I was since there’s a flood of (very cute) galos and lios. Laying in bed and remembered that earlier today I put on sunglasses and immediately said “cool” aloud to myself 
Goodnight twitter. am i really gonna
try to reorganize my portfolio site rn. november's already almost over..time just fucking flies,,. sdfgsdfg so hard to decide to retire smth y'all who do one single order-it-now-or-go-fuck-yourself per product are so strong?? (Has had this item for three years)
Me: WHAT IF SOMEONE STILL WANTS IT. Someone else from Mad Burnish like Meis, Gueira, or Thyma? if anyone went to MassArt or SMFA feel free to hmu w your experiences...... (eyes emoji). ANYC email: ANYC was one week ago!
me, still snoozing: ..are you sure? Bruh they gave out cards at defective pikachu too
More movies should give merch in general — IM LOOKING AT U, PROMARE. Lrt me and also me. Lrt I got us a virus one time by downloading emoticons..sorry. Worst case scenario I feel like you could find someone on Craigslist for this . GWAHH I did a little bit of different things (site edits, inventory, laundry, etc.) but I couldn’t get motivated to power through fully on any of them!! . JAPAN IS NOT HERE. SDFGDHTDTH. we're supposed to journal everything we do for our art/career/whatever and i always don't do it for a week then do it all at once and I can't remember shit so I have to scroll through my photos and twitter to figure out what I did when. I’m a basic bitch - Lio all the way . (Softly) there’s dairy in /my/ scrambled eggs. THIS IS THE ONLY THING I KNOW HOW TO MAKE, aWhy would you take it away from me?!! You’re very cute. LMFAOO I’m just joking around   I respect our difference in egg preferences. We can still be friends . LRT NOOO. GET YOURSELF SOMEBODY THAT CAN DO BOTH. ((Thank you! )). I had an idea for a ridiculous multipart standee that would be a Ton of work to make and also cost many dollars to make. Mom: my calendar
Me: galendar
Mom: G...g...
Me: Galar-ndar
Mom: Galo-ndar. FASHION IS HARD. I’m tryna dress characters but this applies to all facets of Fashion. ANDY??? You always draw fashion illustrations what are you talking about??  rn I’m drawing based on like....visual kei ..is this still cool or am I just nostalgic for it. Aaaa!! I’m so glad this arrived safely! This is the officially the first backer photo I’ve seen! Thank you so so much for sharing this, and for supporting this project!! I’m glad you already found a home for the sticker too . My tablet cord is very seriously on its last leg...... Already so much kiri just in today’s episode too .

I never read it but what a concept. IM GONNA NEED MORE INFORMATION. I’m so curious now but I feel like some things need to be consumed when you’re younger or when they’re popular or you’ll just be like wtf. Y'ALL LOOK SO CUTE AND ALSO WARM!!! LRT ok obviously I'm here for the kiribaku but---LMFAOO THE ARTIST EVEN INCLUDED DENKI PLAYING W OJIRO'S TAIL (canon) i'm dyin. youtube played me this song and now i'm obsessed https://www. youtube.com/watch?v=Z6kNQE zQJpA   …. me: WHO NEEDS REFERENCES A GUITAR LOOKS LIKE THIS NOW. I spent a long time making outfits for these fools only to realize there's no room to do that on a 2" chibi. pff i love these little background moments that people grab onto yknow. Next level down from drawing instruments without reference: not drawing them at all pic.twitter.com/p7plOqp2OA. fdgdg i felt so sick today I slept til like 5 or 6 PM and now i feel better but it's 2 AM and I'm just. here. awake. pfff not how i intended but hey whatever works  
gonna try to sleep in a sec!! i hope you get rest too :). Had a weird dream where I made s Kickstarter for slippers and foam fingers. Shippings a nightmare and the packages wouldn’t move much today even if you did do them. Enjoy your well deserved break!!! Remember to stretch and drink water! YOU KNOW ONE TIME I ALMOST MADE SLIPPERS   I still want to it’s just really illsdvised haha. *ill-advised. Tracing drives me crazy under any circumstances - but what really drives me crazy is when people like..they trace but they do such a good job? Like they change so much and color and render so nicely etc like bruh just don’t fucking trace and you’d be good at art??? U idiot?? LMFAOOOO (runs to make that Kickstarter) quick give me $50,000. Follow your dreams. It’s weird cause I follow a couple of the students i TA for on their art instas bc we’re also in another class together all as students..such a weird experience. Me three weeks ago: start getting ready for shop sale :)
Me now: FUCK WAIT IM STILL NOT READY. Lrt idk shit about this kid but please put more of him on my TL cause he looks cute. Aaa Jacki!! Thank you so much for supporting my project and in general! I always get happy when I see your icon in my notifs   I’m glad it arrived safely - and before your pride pack fell apart completely . The...what?? Skdndjd it’s really cute to see my students on insta all excited like “this is my first repeat pattern!”. Ohh shit I have class tomorrow huh
I didn’t do.. /my/ repeat pattern... I needed a break from it tbh feeling STUCK. To be fair I’m not a student but I know she’ll be like WHERES YOUR PROGRESS lmfaoo. It’s already 2 pm cause im thrown off from yesterday but I’m gonna do some shit today you just watch!!!! me when I was trying to look for fanny packs. unfortunately for me, I like cute jerks  LMFAOOO.    . it's really hard..a  lot of people moved to platforms that don't have a marketplace > A<. wHAT no way?! (backs away slowly). Aaa yes!! I tried looking on Etsy before I made these and I was like 'what is this' bc like 90% of it was unconvincing digital mock ups   I hope one day the world is full of cute, well-considered fanny packs! <3. I had a really cute base idea for this stand but now I thought LED bases would be cool too and I'm TORN and they're both EXPENSIVE lmfaoo. maybe it could be like choose your own adventure since i think u pay for all the parts separately anyway.. LMFAO. I ..(gathers this little Lio in my arms)... love him. math is blue, science is green, english/language arts is red, and history is yellow...purple is misc or like foreign language https:// twitter.com/Ievihoe/status /1198137127952953344   …. (softly) how many hypothetical dollars would this cost me or you're still figuring it out. blocked. me: look how cute this lio plush is!
mom: look how cute galo is!
(later)
mom: why do you have a lio button and no galo?
MY MOM... LIKES GALO APPARENTLY. THEY ARE A SET!! Oy.... me every sunday night, like a child: I don't wanna go to school tomorrow :(. That’s how it goes huh . Sjdbdhd and you know if you were home every day it’d be like 20 days instead . OHH IM SO JEALOUS I found my 2018 calendar the other day and I was like “it’s pretty...should I put it back up?” . Hdhdhdhd uh oh biggest project of the semester and we got so many emails today about not making progress fmfnf. Lots of people still didn’t make edits to past projects and the prof wants to squeeze in a mini project and there’s only three classes after today,.......I tried to tell her I think it’ll be too much.........curious to see how this goes.............. Dndjdj someone legit 2.5 ft from me on the train is super sick.....@ this country please wear sick masks. Both   save me!! My mobile twitter is doing that thing where it doesn’t show me all my mentions! We had this just sometimes for fun too  (and still do) but pb&j on ritz like little cracker sandwiches! me: you're always saying I should get a case for the body pillow in my closet!
mom: it is a nice pillow though
me: would look nicer with galo on it---. yeah.........it's really reckless of them to give her a loan and it would've been beneficial of them not to sdfgfdg so it goes.. she's had a couple places seem interested but the exchanges back/forth just go really slowly... it's just hard this time of year bc of the holidays :\. (sets one thousand alarms to cancel my ill*ustrator subscription before getting billed for the full year). relearning illustrator.. this k*lls the man. please pour one out for me, this is how i d*e. aaa I'm so glad it arrived safely! Noo,  thank YOU for supporting its creation! Enjoy!! . lrt he looks like a fancy little brat color me intrigued. GOOD. (simultaneously)
bro: i talk to strangers all the time!
me: talking to strangers makes me nervous. /pats self on back for re-learning illustrator basics tonight. aaa I hope my manu lets me tack this sample on to my order...........i wanna see him. I want to see one of those giant collages of every kiri you’ve ever drawn. My mom@9 PM: lets go to bed early today

I had dreams about my grandma and Pichi (my first dog) last night
And just now I got sad bc I couldn’t remember the last time I ate my grandmas brisket
And then I got sad again bc I remembered that’s what we gave pichi for her last meal sgdbdk. UH OH. LRT PEAK PRODUCT DESIGN. Ooh it looks so sunny where you are! I’m jealous!   
Thank you so much for supporting this project!! . Sir it is 8 am shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh a landscaper moving in next door was the worst fear I didn’t know I had. Aa thatd be so fun! I’d be curious to hear the differences too!! Otakon and Anime Boston are pretty sizeable east coast cons too - guess it depends where you want to visit! This is how I walk when I get off the train but I’m still listening to music https:// twitter.com/0_90189/status /1198598660985982976   …. Just trying to picture like being out in a café or smth and overhearing people having this conversation aloud. I’m trying to picture what level of confused my face would be. Update: she let me add it   Excited to try smth new+cool but not crazy out of the box...I hope it comes out well and that you guys like it too! I’m excited! I haven’t been so excited about new fan merch in a little while !! https:// twitter.com/cambrasine/sta tus/1199206976389029888   …. I can’t imagine have like hundreds of thousands of followers I just got 5 DMs and I was Shocked LMFAOO. IM RUNNING OUT OF DOLLARS GKIDS please. wait I thought this was a joke. ITS NOT A JOKE IM SHOOK. This is so out of the blue I —. my pajamas smell like chips :(. Your style just has this really consistent softness to it that I just ADORE!!! i want to have a new self portrait for portfolio site and junk but i don't want to draw it please give me a solution. occurred to me that I won't have promare merch ready before the sale ;; SORRY I'M SLOW AND YOU ALL MUST PAY FOR MY WEAKNESSES (literally.h.a..ha.). MY MOM WILL TELL ME THE SAME STORY OVER AND OVER AGAIN YET I AM 23 YEARS OLD WHEN I LEARN SHE FORGOT TO BRING HER GLASSES ON HER HONEYMOON LDFSGHGH. STORY TIME The year is 1990. My parents marry. My mom wears contacts instead of glasses. They go straight from the wedding to their flight to the first of several destinations on their honeymoon. She does not have her glasses. My grandparents mail them express to London. When my mom leaves London, the glasses have still not arrived. They are forwarded to France. Once again they do not arrive in time. They are forwarded again, to Italy. The glasses take a European tour, always arriving just too late, and arrive back in the US after my parents do. I really love how this plush was designed tbh , i get so happy when our hair matches. This review referred to Mac n cheese as a “trend” . Idk about this fool but I have never stopped eating Mac n cheese and j never will. [RTs ]  IT'S THAT ONE SALE I DO!

Anyway Hit the Back by King Princess has been on repeat in my head since Saturday. those scam emails that are like SOMEONE DISPUTED THEIR PURCHASE always make me think /maybe/ until it's like 'the charge was $800' who the fuck is spending $800 on my merch. Someday I’ll do holmat but I’m like 3 for 3 on forgetting to apply and it’s always exactly when my bro’s coming home . Omg thank you, same to you friend. I’m so excited about the sample I ordered but I need to calm the fuck down cause she literally just put the order in and it could be like ten days or twenty and I NEED TO REFOCUS THAT ENERGY INTO DRAWING THE REST OF THE SET. That /is/ how you know it’s time for bed
Goodnight friend! I’m going to sleep too! HES GOT A WHOLE LITTLE ECOSYSTEM UP THERE HUH. S—-sunny !! How can you say all this with Snorlax /right there/   when he can apparently explode you with the wave of afinger. (I agree tho Venusaur especially would be cool!!). suddenly my printer doesn't work and the problem is that it's like not sending out a signal or connecting or smth but the wifi button is kind of broken so it gets stuck in but even the time I did get it to flash and followed the steps it still didn't work and 'm at a loss. oof get wrecked Bostonians... btw The Showcase Cinema in Revere, MA has a 4DX theater....haha just kidding..unless? also the Museum of Science. omg..are you..supposed to be able to do that? Yeah, there's not /a lot/ of places that are equipped for it here, but there definitely are /a few/. Museum of Science did that collaboration with Anime Boston too so they may be down for shenanigans LMFAO. Update: true to my usual style I was not able to fix the problem but did find a work around which involved first accidentally disconnecting my WiFi altogether before giving up and diving into the cursed “box o’ random cords” pic.twitter.com/tYUBqhj5iA. (Gathers them up into my arms) hey little guys you’ll be ok.......

Hopefully the rest are in good shape . Eeeep! Yeah that’s not...I think maybe a different company was making this style of charm first so maybe they’re still figuring it out here. PHMYGODNDNFBD oh no... IM OUT OF POSITIVE TAKES GOOD LUCK BUDDY. feel like this is a good promare song https://www. youtube.com/watch?v=Sd6QnO R0T6c   …. Hello I am just making mashed potatoes and it is taking so long I will never be a housewife. That deadass took like 35 minutes .,, absolutely not. I know this doesn’t look amazing but you just have to trust me on it ok
Attempt number ? at recreating my grandmas brisket. She always eyeballed everything and when you asked if she puts x in it she would go “you could” and we’d be like “nooo what do /you/ do grandma?!” pic.twitter.com/Dzz8E6WsPe. Just regular potatoes?? And I only used two?? They took so long to soften up. Ohmygod ...a similar nonsense method that prevents it from being recreated perfectly . Häagen-Dazs coffee and Ben & Jerry’s chocolate fudge brownie thanks for coming to my TED talk. I’ve never done that but as I was tweeting this I was like “omg..together”

But in general I’d say Häagen-Dazs is better ice cream and I’m a picky bitch so I don’t like probably 99% of B&js flavors . Lrt one day I’ll have dollars and a cool enough oc to commission mecchi. It’s 4 AM but I’ve been sleeping on and off since 8 bc I got a headache and now I feel better but again it’s 4 AM what do. Over the last 24 hours I’ve gone AWWW like three times some people are just so nice it’s nice..idk how to word it other than that. First thought: what day?
Second thought: oh bc of the balloons :)
Third thought: .....wait.... Dndjdj literally last night I was thinking of this person in a class of mine who really likes western cartoons and like referred to that as her most well known trait and I was like ehhhh then I realized we are the Same. we said Fuck Turkey bc no matter how small it’s always way too much for the two of us (  brooo) so we’re making bread and maybe brownies. Anytime I have to write about myself I’m like uh hi I like anime and..dogs. Oh I was about to email my manu and ask if smth was possible but I realized it wasn’t and now I’m bummed out dnfnfnf. Hopes and dreams crushed by LOGISTICS. Probably not the best time to ask a question but - 

Acrylic standees; do you like them being able to change to keychains (hole on top) or is it distracting and stupid looking? 

Poll in reply if you don’t know what I’m talking about. Stands w holes on top pic.twitter.com/vYIhVktmJe. oh.... I...... I always read it sans-'fuck' ..i'm honestly not sure how most people take it. You’ve created chaos w this tweet . Please make a poll . A few blissful weeks but the all-day nausea back in full force . "what" - me when anyone selects priority shipping for my merch. me: why the fuck am I rapidfire selling T*kyo Mew Mew merch on E*tsy all of a sudden?
me: OH MY GOD WAIT--. YESSS ANDYYY WELCOME. Friendship ended with sh*pp*ngeasy 
Now pirateship is my best friend. AAAAAA YOU'RE MAKING ME EXCITED TO SEE IT AGAIN BUT THERES  A WEEK AND A hALF YET. GKIDS next announcement: PROMARE!!! LIMITED RELEASE IN THEATERS FOR ONE YEAR ONLY!! (scrEAM) a pink one?? Ahah I'm just joking ~ originally it was supposed to be just two days in September, but they extended it to a couple weeks, then they announced redux sub 12/8, then a week or two later they announced redux dub 12/10 and then a couple days ago they announced 4DX 12/11 . Yess, we bought our tix right away hbu? No 4DX for MA though :(. Couple more hours~ https:// twitter.com/cambrasine/sta tus/1199560029898186752   …. Aaaa I’m so sorry! :( doesn’t help now but for future reference most places / tix are refundable minus fees so sometimes better safe than sorry. Oh no!!! What bad timing . Don’t really see/have much family anymore after Events Occurred but my bro and his gf will be here for a few weeks starting next month so I’m looking forward to having fun w them . It's LIVE !   Let me know if there's any issues! https:// twitter.com/cambrasine/sta tus/1199560029898186752   …. I can’t believe only two replies and someone took the words right out of my mouth —. Meis and gueira? Or either of my OCs  pic.twitter.com/kaPP2ZVGgv. Ah yes, 12:29 AM, just on time  pic.twitter.com/uxSLCKO3wv. me@circadian rhythm tonight: get FUCKED. Keep an eye out in case someone refunds their ticket :o 

but we can all still yell together on the internet at least . Gwahhh did you not get enough sleep? I think I heard you can catch the flu from up to 6 feet away . Scalp massages are heavenly..  I love him!! I can’t believe someone else requested this before I could but I’m going to say thank you for this content. :(. Very productive morning just laying here willing my neighbors to stop hammering. Ahh lately I’ve been teetering back and forth..Some days I’ll see where my peers at school’s work is at and be bitter that I’m not anywhere near graduating and other days I see what everyone is creating and doing with their art or small business and feel like I’m falling behind. LMFAOO any prof will just email me like hey send this to the class and it’s not much of a bother it’s just funny bc she literally could’ve just done it w the same level of difficulty as emailing me? Saturday is my usual shipping day so if you plan to order in stock items and want it ASAP you may wanna order now   Gonna pack when I get back from a brief walk in the cooold!! https:// twitter.com/cambrasine/sta tus/1199560029898186752   …. I GOOFED, MY FRIEND!! Fixed it!! Thank you so much for pointing it out - write me a note and I'll throw you a little smth extra!! TT A TT.  yes, they’ve been sold out for a while! Sorry! I think all I have left from that set is Mew. (Thank you so much for sharing my sale btw!!). Thank you for the opportunity! 

 https:// twitter.com/cambrasine/sta tus/1199560029898186752?s=21   … https:// twitter.com/cambrasine/sta tus/1199560029898186752   …. So it begins. I may not have posted much but my sketchbook and WIPs are all promare you don’t have to explain yourself to me. crying bc i  drew the two characters i'm confident about and now i have one i'm not confident abt and one i havne't  drawn before. fdgdcg my friend visiting from LA wants to walk around the city tomorrow and i'm just like sir do u remember that... that it's COLD HERE. y...yea.h... and like.. i .. i go into cambridge for school twice a week pls don't make meeee (he wants to show his gf I don't blame him but also Fuck). hop's real cute but his hair is a pain huh.

But I won’t. But I wnana. Mewmewmemewmemwmw pic.twitter.com/Rcbqe8Gvr5. I think he is destined to forever be “pizza guy”. Never thought I’d be that guy in the comments like PLeasE CcOme to X Place but.............Boston......... I have no control over the snow and whether my school or prof cancels class but still 50/50 about whether having to go in to school or having to deal with emailing 16 students to send their work and then replying w crit is worse. Keep my man-spreading Lio by my bed    @kurapixel pic.twitter.com/50Wl8JupOy. Mostly bc even when the whole rest of my room was spotless I still never cleaned my desk RIP. Ahah I haven’t smelled like cigarettes in a while   I don’t like it but it’s very nostalgic !! wahhh I miss my friend already..we only get to see each other a few times a year for a few hours. I finally wore this shirt but we didn’t end up leaving the house  pic.twitter.com/ibmhZKSs9m. We were thrifting in AZ and I wanted my bro to get this shirt bc I have a flamingo pattern dress but it was too small for him and I was like :( and then I realized U FOOL IT CAN BE YOURS. THANK YOU MY FRIEND!! It looks even better in person bc the cameras washing it out..it’s navy not black and the pinks and turquoise are bright!! YESSS. LOOK SO CUTE!!!!!AAA. man I gotta??? get out more!
I saw friends today and yesterday and even though it was only a couple hours each time just like!! wow!!! 
It's fun hanging out with people you love,. your hair looks SO good, worth the $$$. yay!!! it's good to look good but it's even better to FEEL good!! when I finish this promare merch it's over for you bitches
(no but really I hope y'all like it LOL). AGREED Idk what it is exactly about hair cuts/color that is like? always feels very transformative and is often like ..smth happens in your life and you're like fuck what am i gonna do about this??? HAIR CHANGE. ahaha yes yes that's ME!! RIGHT THERE!! wow! My mom brought home KNISHES and PEANUT BUTTER CUP ICE CREAM what the fuck yess
tis a feast. I just barely resisted the urge to shamelessly promote these in light of recent Tokyo Mew Mew news but then I saw other people do it and thought screw it – 

  These gals are online@ http:// cambrasine.art/shop-all     Plus my 10-15% off sale is on thru 12/2  pic.twitter.com/RVptj3ykww. WHY AM I HYPING EVERYONE UP. ok we got TMM, still waiting on shugo chara.  Aaaaaaaaaaaaaa. I LOVE,, MIRIO'S LIL PONYTAIL 
excited for next week! Yes, these gals are mine!! I drew Ichigo and Pudding like literally two years before I got off my butt and finished the rest! I can tell by the clip you got them way back when! It's always so funny when things like that happen!! I'm so glad you still enjoy them <3. pour one out for Amu. "you made a nice effort, honey" - my mom, very patronizingly, on me trying to put the pots and pans away in the "correct" spots. when my bro comes home he rearranges everything so there's no point in learning. I almost (but don't) buy a shugo chara cosplay like once a month tbh. OHHH I COULD TOTALLY SEE YOU IN THAT!! I did not know this before now but it totally makes sense

I vibe more w Amu but I prefer Utau's outfits ,, it's a struggle. lrt I do'nt know you kids but I love and support you all. Me, upon seeing the ice cream: holy——
Mom: I got you the bigger size because I figured you don’t have to eat it all at once :)
Me: ok well it sounds like you don’t know me at all. BRUH pic.twitter.com/lQF6M7s4i9. me before dinner: i'll draw after dinner
me after dinner: is bed??time????? i've been saving myself to buy this merch from a japanese artist and they could list it at any moment and they always start rapid fire-tweeting as soon as I lay down to sleep bc of the time difference and i'm like AAAA. In all honesty I’d be mew cantaloupe but you know I’m not drawing an all orange outfit. Ngl being blonde IS more fun. I forget how much I love Dalmatians until I see one and then I just feel like yelling and crying (in a good way) bc I LOVE THEMS SO MUCHNCV. I feel like Cady is very Dalmatian shaped. It’s the worst bc I DONT KNOW WHAT WORDS TO BLACKLIST TO STOP SEEING IT..twitter please spare me. Lrt tanjirou got the short end of he stick w this swap but deku looks cute in tanjirous outfit! Lrt (scream) my ex and I would always plan to play LiS as soon as possible and not once did I go over there and not have to wait 30 mins - 2 hours for him to download it  and often to also make room on his computer . Aaa that’s always the best!! love when con apps make me give all my info to a third party. my prof really keeps emailing students like we're having class tomorrow............................................................ OHHHH!!! CONGRATULATIONS!!! oop pic.twitter.com/b4ysj42HTM. i['m sorry but do you know how fun it is to draw your like??? ideal self ????? yes my ideal self is gradient purple hair and bunny ears and FRILLY ROMPER. wow it's been a minute since i went for it w shiny marks and gradients. Noragami themes slap 
I wish I hadn’t fallen off reading the manga . protip: do not charge your computer while drawing or you'll never have to get the fuck up and stretch/pee/hydrate. haikyuu spoilers //

i fell off watching and never read but somehow I still find wealthy grown up kenma + him sponsoring hinata Extremely satisfying. # TokyoNewMew  completely derailed my day but I can't even be mad.. Here's Mew Artificial Grape?   

I have LOTS of drawings of Ichigo, but any pseudo-mews were not preserved. I did have my own-universe magical girl self-insert tho so here's those - All chibi style
2019->2009 pic.twitter.com/8ceQE4YH4m. She’s artificial grape bc I don’t like grapes as a fruit, but I’ve always liked grape juice and artificial grape lollipops, popsicles, medicine etc. was my flavor of choice as a kiddie . also fun fact i am Very OK at hula hooping in that I can do it for a pretty long time but I can't do anything fancy LMFAOO. RIGHT? I still default to that for lollipops when the occasion arises ahah. THANK U I SPENT WAY TOO MUCH TIME ON THIS. Oh yes I clearly had a lot of fun . Omg this is the second tweet like this I’ve seen today

I’m also not on that side of the equation but I think the fun is that you can alter it to your tastes and come up with a personality, story, etc. prob good for people who don’t Art or can’t afford custom commissions? Yeah I’m also in that vein but I can see how less artistically inclined people could find it appealing , just not my jam. Mmm I feel ya. Maybe it’s kinda like..well there’s no personality/story most of them time but like....if someone created ichigo for adoption u might right  LOL. It’s me,,, Jason, from CVS pic.twitter.com/e3ClSpVDvA. My mom found this while cleaning and I’ve literally never even known a Jason in my life ? we must’ve found it on the ground or smth . HOW LONG WILL I DRAW MY PART ON THE WRONG SIDE.  eeeep!! Thank you!!! . It’s bc we’re used to seeing ourselves in the mirror   rip us. Holy shit I’d watch that game show. ok but what if i cant fit 6 strings on a tiny  chibi guitar
are we all ok. I'M NEVER DRAWING INSTRUMENTS AGAIN AFTER THIS get fucking wrecked Given boys, Carol&Tuesday,---. if this tweet implies i'm drawing them i'm not...i should tho.......................eventually.. (squints). i was able to name almost all the parts of the drum set (bc of my brother) i'm pretty impressed w myself LMFAOO. One guess where I’m from  pic.twitter.com/gByQKqdpiO. Ok today is not looking like my day I’ve also had uhhhh 4 - 5 hours of sleep bc of my own foolishness and now I gotta fucking go dig out the car or smth. The problem is as of last night Boston had 1.5 inches and we had,,,,, 7.5. Sorry I’m bad mood mute me . Ok yeah it’s not possible to leave slash would be pretty ill advised, plus it’s still snowing and we’re supposed to get like 8 more inches so I think school is not happening which makes me happy but also my prof is not going to be happy .  Thank you, sorry for being cranky . A student from a town or two over called out so I don’t feel as bad. Just 12 HOURS left on that one sale I do! https:// twitter.com/cambrasine/sta tus/1199560029898186752   …. aaaa LOVE IT. Ok shoveled stairs and cleaned off car and ate breakfast(?) ....now is .....nap fndndndnd. Omg. I would like to file a formal complaint this first snow storm was too big I did not have time to rebuild my shoveling muscles on smaller storms first. fdgdfh THATS SO BRUTAL THO. I’m sorry friend! I hope you can get caught up and relax soon . jeopardy question: chest candies means these
my mom: boobs...
me: tiddies
contestant: what are medals. (SHAKES THEM BOTH) HE IS A SERIOUS. if i gotta make a new column on my spreadsheet then you've been absent too many times my frienddfsgdfh. They're also doing a two-shot sequel manga feat. the OG girls by the original author+artist :). i've an announcement
after drawing this drum set i will never be drawing again
thank you for coming. Oolooks like preorder stuff should be here Thursday, prob perfect timing to get all y’all’s orders out by Sat :) Sorry I still have a couple packages here from last bc they didn’t fit in the box+our car is still trapped behind ?? Inches of snow   Should hopefully b out tomorro. I am so happy for u. Omg there’s seriously almost as much new snow today as yesterday..and it’s still going. Aaa I hope it’s a good omen!! Oh shiiiit it’s life is strange day huh . Every time I look at my new mew I think “she’s so cute”. SWITCH W ME THEN I’m the opposite! I’m always distracted by when the three of them are like backlit/silhouetted and it’s like silent and they make weird shrug gestures at each other like literally wtf is that. Feeling the burn .. do u think more New Englanders have chronic back pain later in life than other parts of the country. Ehhhh I used my foot/leg sometimes but there was like 8” each two days in a row and super wet/heavy it wasn’t really plowable that way   I appreciate the thought tho! This snow is good for snowballs and snowmen but I’m lonely (single tear). Ahaha me too! . yknow it's almost the end of the semester because I almost signed this email with the name of the student I'm sending it to instead of my own. I thought you were going to say it got a wrecked by a plow but this is somehow more satisfying. sDGFDG I'M SO RESISTANT TO THIS HW ASSIGNMENT it's been on here for six weeks and it's due tomorrow so of course I'm just starting and they're like 'here's a video you can watch if u want!' aND ITS 45 MINUTES LONG absolutely not i'm sorry. We're supposed to make a Instagram business plan, set up planned posts in advance for various events/holidays, etc. etc. There's some videos I thought may be helpful but I skipped ~15 mins in and they just finished setting up the account LOL. hhhhhhh it's such a waste to go to class tomorrow..there's no speaker, so if it's like our other 'on-site' day we're gonna talk in small groups for an hour and go home...and it takes me an hour each way so it's Very Stupid. Aah, mine takes attendance too (I think??) but I’ve only missed 1 and technically you get up to 3 so I’m . I’m sorry you’re also suffering from mandatory wasted time . I'M Trying TO MAKE..DIFFICULT DECISION...regarding..merch..........

#Promare  viewers only pls vote: About Thyma

(Note how you're only allowed to love her, like her, or not know who she is - Dislike is not an option :P ). the problem is she's cute and i already sketched her out and I love her but she /would/ raise the cost to produce (and therefore for you to buy) this merch and I just don't have a handle on whether people know her enough or not. RIGHT? She's so cute I already sketched her I'm just like wondering if I include her if people will be like 'who the fuck is that with lio and his crew'. i dm u. this worked, i'm crYING https:// twitter.com/nanadouken/sta tus/1201853553050038273   …. Sean + Daniel: (howling)
Cady: woof!! LMFAOO THIS IS S O  CUTE. Currently playing chicken w my student hoping she cancels first bc I my body feels broken (post-shoveling soreness). ....I firmly believe this employer is cosmic compensation for all your suffering at your previous workplace. this will only be my second missed class of the semester but I get so much GUILT thanks to the bullshit when I was little hnnnnnnn. Well they should join a debate team on some weird little corner of the internet and leave the rest of us in peace . ,,,,,,,,,,,sunday. Lrt nsfw bdfnfjd. Mmmmmmm an alarm just went off but I have no clue what I set it for.......help. I remember I set it last night.......hm. Me: usually my package comes in one day even though it says two  
Me: ah ok it’ll take two days, but it’ll be here soon  
Me: oh the..the tracking hasn’t updated in over a day huh..that’s...I’m sure it’s fine . Wow!!  you must’ve practiced so hard!! Theyre both /pretty/ but the latest one is just stunning! my package usually comes in 1 day, always in 2, but I’m guessing to due the influx in packages for the holidays it doesn’t look like it’s passed customs yet even though it says it’s coming today. I’ll keep you posted, hopefully it’ll move soon so I can get packages out ASAP! oh no i saw an artist with a pillar directly behind their table and it reminded me of when at AC*EN there was a pillar in FRONT of my booth obscuring ~ 2 feet I paid for :). that whole con felt like a fever dream bc the airbnb was directly below a family w 4-5 kids who literally just ran the length of the house back and forth, screaming, starting at 6 AM every day :) :) :). gwah i wanted to hand smth out at redux but it snuck up on me..... oh no i'm still super excited!! I just wanted to give out freebies too! the art room is almost a functional space i can't believe it

almost. UPDATE: I FELT BETTER BUT THEN I LOOKED AT THE WHOLE REST OF THE HOUSE. one day we will be rid of all this STUFF.....my bro comes home (with his gf) in 10 days tho hahah send help. Can’t wait to see discourse about rose vs magnet pink for the next four fucking days probably. The worst part is even this tweet is contributing I’m sorry friends , lately everyone’s arguing about everything always it’s really ridiculous. Also *magenta orz. Urkklkk my package is so late. They haven’t given me a new delivery date but I’m guessing Monday   was really hoping it’d be here today after it said it was done at the hub last night.. Hello friends! Can you help me find this artist? I received their stuff by mistake! It feels familiar... pic.twitter.com/LFbTqzbHt1. update it didn't get to boston til noon but made it to me today,,blessed 
SORRY FOR ALL THE ANXIOUS PACKAGE TWEETS it's just not a good time of year for shipping yknow. ohh got a tip from someone in AANI - I believe it's @Giulia_Adragna  's art :) I'm gonna go message, thanks for helping me search y'all!! ahh, it sucks but it does happen from time to time! yes!! the world is so small haha. RSDGDHFGH If I was drinking water I would've spit it out oh my god this is amazing. lrt I love this lil fox poke man. my bro has a cold..and the average timeline for passing it on is 1-2 weeks....and if he gets his gf sick................then when they come here in 1.5 weeks...................... /shudders ...PASS! HARD PASS! I haven't gotten a cold this whole semester!! Eeep! Guess so!! I hope she doesn't get sick for both our sakes! haha. This happens to me every single time I order from them so I always build in a day...and it’s like “guaranteed delivery dates” but then when it’s late nothing happens . Suddenly feeling a bit under the weather but I got *almost* all anyc and online preorders packed and *almost* all of the remaining sale / regular orders too!  pic.twitter.com/wuBpc7SGXb. Bby....no............ Me: goes to bed@11:30
Me: (wakes up) is it morning yet
Clock: 2:14
Me: ..............
Me: ............................ does anyone else do that thing where when they successfully buy smth that sells out quickly they keep refreshing to see how much time they had. I've been eyeing these for months! I'm soooo excited to see them in person! Some of the best designed merch I've seen in a while! The artist really considered every aspect and it shows   Worth getting up early for  https:// twitter.com/hnkm_lux17/sta tus/1203298481093263361   …. sometimes it's like 45 minutes and you're like I GOT A HEART ATTACK FOR NOTHING?! and other times its 45 seconds and you're like oh cool. Santander: allows $300 in fraud charges from all over the world, later refunds most but insists they 'verified' that I made the $30 charge in Turkey ( still don't have my money back :) )

Santander when *I* try to buy anything: FRAUD ALERT!!! PLEASE REPLY!! OH GOD!!! cambrasine  is a likeable Centaur who is 174cm in height.
They have medium length, messy, blue hair and golden eyes.
Their bust would fit a K cup.
Their first encounter was with a village elder who they defeated.
#MonsterGirlGenerator https:// en.shindanmaker.com/873881  . I tried to google K cup bc I have 0 frame of reference and the results were those Kuerig coffee cups i'm crying

Also my grandma would say "be nice to old people" :(. aaa good!! yeah I'm generally good at first come first serve game but you never know when your wifi will crash or your bank will have a problem or whatever! TT A TT livin' on the edge LMFAO. Ah, I know a lot of people with bigger breasts get bad back pain..that must be so uncomfortable. One of these times you’re gonna walk into Fed Ex to a giant banner that says We Care, they’ll sit you down and stage an intervention. Just a lill announcement that if you’re waiting on a special fancy strap (KnY charms) those should arrive to me mid week and I’ll get them out ASAP! My first package of them is still missing so I bit the bullet and bought more but I gotta see if they can refund the seller->me. Mom: (hands me a package) what the hell is this
Me: uhhhhhhhhh I think .....you bought me a present?
Mom: oH FUCK. Anyway I’ll be wearing my dope tote from @para049  to redux . Very important prep for tomorrow  pic.twitter.com/uOB0EZ7CRE. Just posted a pic ;). I definitely will!  Thank you for creating these and best of luck at your show in February! :). I feel that!! Before this arrived today I was contemplating making a really sad insert for one of my ita bags and putting my life 5 pieces of merch in it haha. * U* isn't it?! I can't wait to see it in daylight! It's from  @para049  (and the heart shaped keychain is too). pic.twitter.com/RdTPEz9p79. omg probably!! I know so many people going - it's gonna be one big party huh? It's from @kurapixel  <3. OH NO. SNACKTIME. there's so much yelling outside? I think the kids are playing on the hill..pls be carefulsdGFH. I FORGOT ABOUT,,, #SpongeBobMusicalLive 
I am
very curious. IM SO LATE rippy it's playing on like 4 channels rn but they're not playing it after,, ya bastards do that back to back bs!!! :(. yee. My mom found two pocketbooks while cleaning and BOTH were destroyed and abandoned due to melted chocolate. oh no i had more stupid promare merch ideas. ok the last 4000 times my silhouette has just eaten my stickers so send good vibes cause this is the only sheet I have LOL. Hello I’ll have these very stupid hand cut stickers for #promareredux  tomorrow!
Don’t judge my craftsmanship rn  I’ll post my outfit or seat or smth tomorrow so you can find me~ pic.twitter.com/JJ6ZsD4bpp. Oh? I thought it was just translated for fun so you know what goes on at the cheer screenings in Japan
Even when I went in October though people couldn’t stop giggling, it was fun but I imagine it could be annoying if it’s your first go! I hope you enjoy your screening ! Ah yeah I agree! I also like —- I looked at that list it was so long there’s no way anyone could remember all that without reference . I could look like anything bc I may do an outfit change (so cold!!) but I will have my giant tote and free stickers at Boston Common today! I can be very shy but just ask me!! #promare  #promareredux pic.twitter.com/2KWicJBaon. Four is such a solid number of times to see Promare because 1st: I DIDN'T EXPECT TO REALLY ENJOY THAT, 2nd time: WOW I DIDN'T SEE THAT THE FIRST TIME 3rd time: GIDDY 4th: I just got to calmly enjoy it like OH /THAT/ GOOD PART IS NEXT..OH NOW THAT PARTS NEXT, THAT PARTS GOOD TOO. heheeee what a warm fuzzy day!!! . also after galo-hen solidified THYMA IS IN THIS ok
now I just gotta
FINISH DRAWING HER
THEN FINALLY POST THING IM EXCITED ABT. i can't imagine why they'd do it with just the galo one unless this was coming .. -- just SLAPPED in the face w the fact that I got CLASS tomorrow!! I'm so confused bc I got trapped by snow and couldn't go last week it feels like another lifetime LMFAO..........ok.sleep. I saw someone say they didn’t get the plot and I was like bro I think u ..are overthinking it... There’s a lot of discourse today abt yelling/clapping/cheering etc . Sorry this is me. I think the joke is that lots of promare fans haven’t seen the movie because of its sporadic release so they lost their “promare virginity” - have seen the movie so now they aren’t qualified to be a fan. Yes. Yknow,,,, the regular one
(Idk it’s probably like Lipton or smth????? I’m sorry). OH nO...I...I LIKE MY INTERPRETation BETTER. (Inhales)
I gotta go to class. Omg I didn’t even realize you were OP I’m so sorry I am,,, still asleep LMFAOO 
OK NOW I UNDERSTAND AND YES THAT IS VERY WEIRD SORRY U EXPERIENCED THAT. Can I. Why can’t I rt this. Lrt can confirm for one beautiful frame Galo has a nip. Blessed. The class before us in our room Sucks they leave huge messes and today: paint fumes
So many students felt sick and left early...woozy. Holy shit someone at my school!?? Actually did smth fucking helpful??? Now I only have to pay $75 more out of pocket before my loan is dispensed instead of $700-1k . The worst part is right next to the door to the classroom is a spray booth with ventilation specifically for that purpose. Last time the room smelled like paint cause they used it but didn’t turn the vent on —- this time they did it IN the classroom instead of the booth . Sjdbdjsm honestly!! it would’ve been a Rough couple months. An absolutely essential stitch on my skirt broke this morning (the one that makes an envelope skirt an envelope) so I panicked like WHAT CLOTHES LOOK NICE and dug this gem out pic.twitter.com/2mlBgnRN0s. > Greasy hair, make up, nice clothes
> Clean hair, make up, comfy clothes
> Clean hair, no make up, nice clothes

You’re only getting 2 of 3 from me max, choose wisely. A few students today literally just said “No” to feedback at critique. Best of luck when your AD says change it and you say “No”. I'M GLAD IT FINALLY ARRIVED TO YOU!!! SORRY FOR BEING SUCH A SLOWPOKE!! Enjoy <3. ..YOU OK BUDDY. sending good vibes!! hope it's all resolved soon! Big sigh bc I went to bed at 9 at therefore woke up at 12. Made the mistake of getting up and the anxiety hit hard. Stupid body how can I get anything done if you don’t let me sleep. Ohh it’s really cute! Really! Not that I’m an expert but in passing i haven’t seen anything like this ! Aaa yeah I feel the western ones just..have a more western cartoon feeling style and these ones have like  big shoujo eyes . since seeing Promare on Sunday I have eaten the following:
> accidental vegan pizza
> mini frozen pizza
> slice of pizza
> cursed homemade pizza

Stop Being Mean to Yourself Challenge. Polar bear onesie: but make it Fashion  pic.twitter.com/8BqSelO9TJ. Yes my mirror is still spotted and no I’m not anticipating that to change in the near future. This is Cover material. Guh the guy who fucked up installing our drain LAST DECEMBER and then proceeded to ghost us on and off for a year showed up completely unannounced today so I guess this is happening now. For reference he is working directly next to my bedroom zzzzzz. There’s a spray called A/frin that is addictive but others like saline spray, fluticasone aren’t! One time I got prescribed specifically only 2 Days of A/frin and fell down the rabbit hole of people w addiction losing their taste, smell, but unable to stop . Lrt must nasal spray to survive, my dumb ass is scared of surgery. Omg looks like the weather dips down to the 20s for days once my bro and his gf get here..she’s gonna freeze to death (she lives near the equator). Hello what attainable food do people like to eat
My prof wants to buy food for the class (16). Last time she bought vegetarian sushi .. Jfc my mom has to wear this giant boot now , they said if she kept walking on her foot it would’ve like caved in or smth. me: :) :) :) cool thing coming at u tonight :) :)
migraine: get Wrecked 
me: j...k................ UK fuckin' up again makes me anxious for 2020........ I toook meds to help my headache so i could stay up and do stuff
but no wi'm drowsy
this was not a success. u mean to tell me lamenting about my weaknesses and scrolling on twitter doesn't make me a better artist? (is shocked). i think it's fair game!the great thing about any kind of art is that no 2 people think exactly the same, even if the start point is the same. It sounds like the point of your fic would be to make something /different/ than what the other person made, so it shouldn't be an issue? aaa I get migraines so often though!! I'd never get anything done if I did that   its a nice thought tho. [RTs ] #MADBURNISH  is coming to a venue near you! Get a front row seat to this year's  HOTTEST show!

PLUS I'm also offering a solo Lio on an LED Base

Preorder til 12/18 + Info@ http:// cambrasine.art/shop-all   pic.twitter.com/N04SGgNxvY. LMFAOO ZAMBI U RT'D THIS INSTANTLY,,, THANK YOU FRIEND !!! . now y'all know why i didn't post art for 84 years i'm slow AF and that was A LOT OF FIGURIN'. Here’s a video of LED base Lio! 
This is just a sample you may notice I later gave him a nose  

Preorder@ http:// cambrasine.art/shop-all   pic.twitter.com/4lHSzaaex5. Special mention to @sara_capello  whose OG idea sparked the creation of this! Go check out their rad art!! . I LOVE HER,, I was iffy bc I wasn't sure if she was recognizable but with the prequel shorts I was like YES GOOD HERE WE GO! he loves u too . Thank you!!! YEAH, I wanna hear those jams . THANK YOU FRIEND, I DIE/D FOR IT. 'Don't call me 'Danna'' but to the tune of Don't Call Me Angel. ahha I'll prob make brownies again! I think she wants like /food/ food though;;.  aaaa thank you for the support!! I'm really looking forward to having these made!  thank you so much I worked my lil butt off on it! Yess thyma is a babe, she needs more love!!    (ps @KomunHorangi  hello I love your work). I can’t believe she just sat there and took this (don’t worry I gave her a treat after  ) pic.twitter.com/XczGolZv7I. I love your page previews lately w the sad and angry faces in the speech bubbles . Aaa citra!! Thank you so much! It was one of those laying in bed at 3 AM ideas ahaha

I’m guessing it hasn’t come to your country yet? Such a sporadic release.. Just want to say thank you for the support on this so far! I worked really hard on it knowing that due to the cost I could only really create it with your help, so I’m really grateful! Please look forward to it, I know I am!! Band AU Mad Burnish would have dope pyrotechnics, Burning Rescue would use dry ice send tweet. Hehe I really like that look on him too! It’s classy .  I never would’ve ended up here without you bringing it up!! /throws stand@u.  goal achieved. THANK YOU!! I love your designs so it means a lot . THANK YOU!! . She deserved better . Oh h-hello, are you..also waiting? pic.twitter.com/GUSGmBOaXW. YES gaaah suffering. And the worst is that you’ll get more migraines (which prevent U from doing things) when you’re more stressed (when u have more things to do!!!). Doomed . They were so busy where we got lunch that he made too many mozzarella sticks and now I have so many merry Christmas happy Chanukah y’all. *so busy he kept fuckin up LOL. wHAT. I’ve been seeing Japanese fans criticize it too idk where this person is living. Thyma deserved better so I gave her that chance   And Lio ran away from his prissy family to pursue music
And motorcycles. OOF ...... Honestly tho I have this problem w/ Twitter vs Insta?? some things are popular on both but a lot of the time one is way more popular on one than the other..it's consistently inconsistent...... I just love how the photos are rendered in the life is strange games..even if sometimes they don't look exactly like the characters I like the decision they made to have this big brush painterly style instead of looking like game screen shots. holmat is one of those cons i just consistently forget. gosh it's so much more fun problem solving my students' work than my own ...if only they listened to our feedback more than 20% of the time. THANK U,, MEANS A LOT FROM MERCH-MAKING ROYALTY LIKE YOURSELF. LMFAOO I ALMOST WROTE 'ITS LIT' in the product description. Rather, I DID write it but I took it out against my better judgement  
segth Thank you so much friend, I'm really glad it shows!! I couldn't have committed to drawing this if I didn't adore them all~. Thank you! Had to get that lovely gal in there~~ She's fun to draw too! It wasn't a problem until the last couple weeks but please don't avoid paying for shipping by using codes that don't apply to your order or selecting 'add to existing order' when u don't have an existing order :( I then have to choose lose money or suffer (e-mails). Not trying to be mean to the people who did this - It may have been a misunderstanding - but just a general note for anyone planning to order from me;;. OH! Sorry for the confusion - There music is just playing on my computer for the video. The base is only an LED light, no speaker! sHINSOU!! Wow what a cute family. Ahaha   Thank you so much for the support! everyone's always cooing over N but I missed that generation of games!! I kinda wanna go read his story but I'm also like MAYBE ILL PLAY IT SOMETIME ...but I won't. WOW WHAT A FUN IDEA!!! And amazing execution of course~ . oh no,, my secret identity has been found out~. THEY're BEAUTIFUL. hi twitter what am i forgetting to set a reminder about. i thought of it while I wrote this but i'm still open to suggestions. Thank you !! . Lrt was making the rounds on its own again . My mom officially has a cold pls send reinforcements. LRT hearing Ei-chan so much this episode and hot damn it was CUTE. I also feeling Personally Fucked With by the new movie trailer SDRFGGH. Ei-chan, Ei-chan, Ei-chan~~ . I've been very busy w Lio "Promare" Fotia but dont u dare think i forgot about Eijirou Kirishima. Will do!! btw if you wanna see a bunch of short clips of my dog being cute in the woods head over to my Instagram story. Oh no I just had a stupid idea for a drawing. /The Move/

blob painting so don't look at this too closely but I couldn't NOT illustrate this nonsense after today's ep of bnha

kiribaku plus kiri's handsome childhood friend pic.twitter.com/NFIFTDPhWf. I love boys w inferiority complexes and also the guy w the side part. You mean blob paint?   Big brush, pressure on, zoom WAY OUT.  PLEASE this is a result of me and a few friends yelling abt band au for a couple hours so I can’t take credit anyhow! I would LOVE to see that! I’ve seen a couple people throwing Promare Band content around but not nearly enough!! AVESCORE. oH my arm is . spasming. In my VERY limited experience of these 16 people this 1 semester I found that a lot of them just need someone to tell them keep going - like they'll say this isn't working + sometimes they just need to hear 'try doing it 5 other ways until you get smth you like'. me: if I could just,, draw this slice pizza my life would be better
mom: WANT ME TO GET A SLICE OF PIZZA?
me: What?! No!! (shows my mom drawing progress)
mom: ..I liked his pose better before

(inhales) my mom wants lio to manspread. CUTE. I changed it cause I thought it looked stupid but I forgot it’s promare and we lean into stupid in this house. My mom is moving into the really gross stage of her cold   I wish she didn’t feel so miserable..bad timing too w my bro comint home 

Pls I really don’t wanna get sick as soon as I get out of school aaaaaaa. Good morning I literally jumped bc I thought Cady was in my room (she doesn’t come to this floor by choice, my door is closed, etc) — but it was just my black carry on suitcase that’s been sitting in the same spot for days

The lesson is put your shit away  gonna go lower my bpm. Lrt   cool progression. They’re both beautiful and have such different focuses but the placement of everything in the 2019 one just feels so deliberate yknow what I mmmm saying. aaaa Thank you for your support and for the video~~ * U* I love seeing it in action haha. TT A TT Thank you so much!! I hope you can carve out some time to work on it eventually, I'd love to see!! currently sobbing, staring at turnaround photos of the galo nendoroid, desperately trying to understand his hair. ahha You're probably like me then - I love to keep things in my cart until they're no longer available  
I usually ship weekly but this time of year is busier so I do my best to get them out ASAP! <3. LRT!!! CLEVER!!!!!!!! Just a few more days to preorder!  Depending on certain factors I may or may not be able to reopen/briefly extend, but it will still be the same January/February delivery  https:// twitter.com/cambrasine/sta tus/1205346876708605952   …. sdgdfg I always feel so bad when people buy from overseas  I can't speak to customs fees, but even just getting the package out of the country costs so much.. I WA?NT BUT I OWNT SEND ONE BACK bc i'm bad. ooof yeah sounds more like triple by the end then . Wheeze I might’ve actually gotten enough sleep If cady didn’t come upstairs and start barking next to my door..I didn’t hear anything outside and she didn’t have to go either why this cafe. *cade. SDFDG my prof told me she's gonna miss my laugh which is sweet but also at the same time she was making fun of me LMFAOO. Student work crashed my computer pray for me. My whole immediate family inhales when we laugh i have no idea why AND SHE CALLED OUT MY SNORTING TOOOO. my bro's flying in in like 12 hours and i'm so tired and my mom is sick and the house is still a mess. when a student was complaining about her digital duo experience my prof was like they should hire you to teach photoshop and i was like HAHA MY UNIVERSITY?? GIVING /ME/ MONEY?? MAYBE WHEN /HELL FREEZES OVER/. rip I tried to decide to buy smth but by the time I made up my mind to go for it and resell if I changed my mind they were sold out oops. Aaa I’m so glad he arrived safely! Thank you for supporting me — and for waiting through the Great Lost-Fancy-Strap Debacle of 2019 . Illustrator is a nightmare! I’m glad you have such a caring supplier though, I’m sure the end result will be cute enough to be worth the trouble . Nsfw / kink

My mom was looking for smth on eBay and was like “what the hell is this” and idk if there’s a term but I can only assume it was like mitts(?) for pet play stuff but between my bad vision and tired brain I immediately said “boxing gloves for naked lady”. The worst part is my mom just accepted it and said “well that’s stupid” and anyway we both need to nap. Did you say clean the whole house? Ok :). ....looks legit. At the point of frazzled where I couldn’t even remember /to set a reminder/. Ahaha I’m glad it made you smile at least . Update: I went to set a reminder and I had already set one

In conclusion I remembered that I didn’t remember to set a reminder but when I went to set the reminder I was reminded that I had already set a reminder https:// twitter.com/cambrasine/sta tus/1206783934496944129   …. I’m v tired but I had an idea that I wanted to doodle down quickly and anyway I refuse to change my sketch, Lio has four hands now. Apparently he can’t grab Galo in all the places I want him too with only two hands . “Burning out”   also I love them. Isaiah: what’s wrong with you?!
Me:   WAIT, WAIT I KNOW THIS ONE—-. Lmfaoo haven’t seen him yet bc we both sleep but definitive proof my bro is home pic.twitter.com/7T1Kf4CkG5. Lmfaooo subconsciously matched my shirt pic.twitter.com/hoTh6JWnwk. Everyone’s so thrown off It’s 2 and I’m the only one up . PREORDER UPDATE!

***January/February delivery remains same for both*** https:// twitter.com/cambrasine/sta tus/1205346876708605952   …. bro: I didn't know there were tea bags in here! I thought these were completely empty
me: we wouldn't still have them if they were completely empty!
bro: ....are you sure because (shows me the completely empty one directly next to it). can't believe GKIDS actually stopped showing promare I wanted to bring my brother now that he's home :(. yay~~ Just sent in the assignments for my other class so I'm??? free??????????? I still have to wrap up TA stuff (chase down people who didn't turn in assignments, meet my prof for grading, etc.) but otherwise \o/ semester? done? my broke ass doesn't want to pay for insurance so just send good vibes for this package i guess . can..have any of you been to east providence 10 cinema it looks so cursed and it's disturbingly cheap i'm so concerned?? The reviews are all over the place it’s VERY SPOOKY but it’s quite literally the only option for showing my bro Promare. how one but not the other sdfgxgh stupid government. Big Mood friend. Lrt that’s how I like it. pic.twitter.com/6gBAU2EOmD. My bro and Sara made it, I didn’t help at all except I made the sauce for the other one yesterday. best take i've seen yet. yeah, in English it's like 'I like being with you!' . Anyone order from Zap Creatives recently?? I'm feeling P SURE I received a coupon /with my order/ like in the package, but I can't flippin find it.. If you ordered recently if u can just say yes i also got a code so u prob did too or no jenn you're hallucinating that'd be great. At this point I can't guarantee it'll arrive by Christmas but I'd suggest ordering now if you want to try! Gonna drop some packages off before day end. USPS's First Class non-guaranteed cut off date is tomorrow but I don't believe them LOL. the people who lived here before us left their piano and it's really out of tune but it's nice~ sara's learning to play so she's practicing on it and it's good bg sound.

Phew! I think the Holiday orders are finally over! I hope everyone’s goodies reach them in time and that they’re well-received   
I want to say thank you to everyone who shared my posts, bought my work to treat yourself, your friends, your family! It’s helping pay school loans+keep the heat on - and for now I can see a movie once in a while, or buy my dog a treat, without feeling *too* guilty haha So really thank you thank you!!!    WAH IM GETTING EMOTIONAL SO IM GONNA CUT IT OFF HERE! I think I said everything I wanted! It’s esp. meaningful this year as my fam has been struggling financially a bit recently. I won’t bore you w the details - you’ve probably seen some in passing+we’re doing ok for the moment - just know that your money goes a long way when you choose to shop w small biz + artists. It means a lot that you thought my work would be loved by someone in your life. It’s a Huge compliment. 
I’ve noticed holiday sales increase each year compared to the last. I hope I can keep creating things we both enjoy, that you’ll keep supporting me+my work in the coming year. Bro: (folds plastic bag into a triangle)
Me: cool promare reference. It happens more often than one would think . Yeah by the end you lose about 10% to fees. It’d be hard because they collect everyone’s payment info but don’t charge them until x date so sometimes payments don’t go through, etc...doing it outside the platform would take some figuring. What is happening I’ve been sleeping since like 8. I was actually getting on a good schedule now my body’s gonna get all confused again sigh. welcome to my new lifestyle

I only offered Lio on the LED in hopes of keeping it simple but I had some special requests anyways so you can write in notes if u want one of the other characters  pic.twitter.com/LXnYilA2sG. I’ve been like half-sick and when I protest that I’m mostly ok everyone just keeps telling me how I look bad,,, rude . The full band is a bit more iffy because it's more involved/expensive to make but this LED version I can have made again in the future more easily :). NDNFJDND oh my god I hear a skritch and I turn around to see Cady pawing at this little guy then she hovered over him for a minute and gives him one small kiss on his forehead pic.twitter.com/kWFKvx2mdw. That makes one of us, he’s normally outside so at night I’ll forget he’s there and be very spooked. Sorry if this is ignorant - if you want the chain removable don't most people just have the jump ring with the pin spike going through it to keep it on? So you can easily include or not include it? Ahhh I see what you’re saying hm hm yeah doesn’t hurt to ask I guess? If you place it just right on the head it may not be too obvious but I understand you have a vision you wanna meet!

RIP. Ok!! Order 1 placed. I got a small number of extra LED Lios and extra pizza charms so they're still in my shop for moment :) Hopefully that'll be helpful to those of you who are broke from present shopping, waiting on Christmas money or paychecks, etc. Toast??? rice??

I slipped and fell in the woods yesterday and now my arm is threatening to come off . i have such a hard time drawing ash and eiji so i almost always do shorter for my package doodles...i love him and if you're disappointed i'm sorry but you're wrong. FEELING SAD ABT NOT EXCHANGING HOLIDAY CARDS

I wanted to do it - I just didn't want to add the extra stress of making sure I drew it, $ + ordered on time, sent on time, doodling for everyone, etc u nu 

Maybe next year..or Valentines???

Y'all who did are so strong, good job!! Look at this cute motherfucker pic.twitter.com/fMroA6SvYZ. Really making you work for it . Mmmm wanna draw smth holiday but no ideas :(. You’re so patient it’s looking AMAZING. I have my fathers last name and my mom wants to brag about how I made the Chanukah cards she’s sending and I’m trying to tell her these people don’t know my name. My bro is only four years older but he’s not on twitter so I get to introduce him to lots of memes. On tonight’s episode: “fuck go back” and “I’m at soup”. Happy Christmas Eve + third night of Chanukah to those who celebrate!   (And general happiness to those who don’t!)

Baby’s first cast iron  pic.twitter.com/TCnw0IU4jY. I got to dictate present opening order so I insisted we go from least to most exciting + it was fun to go from “..what is this?” and “oh good, socks!” to Sara lighting up going Beautiful, beautiful” and my bro - he didn’t quite cry but I could see the emotion on his face  . My bro makes beautiful ceramics! His posts are mostly nature photos and homemade bread but he’s@/ flowbouche on insta pic.twitter.com/JpFiVY1FHd.

I love the transparency and glitter in the acrylic & I was so excited by the risograph print I said “wow” aloud three times! Thank you so much @hnkm_lux17  !  pic.twitter.com/24KhlkY3vp. RIGHT? I’ve been eyeing them for months  They did a mail order a couple weeks ago on  http:// booth.pm    and I used a shopping service (tenso) to get them to me! I think the artist will have them at an event in February but I’m not sure if they’re selling online again. I got up at 7 to get them and they sold out in five minutes! . The artist did a mail order recently - I had to use tenso (a shopping service which gives u a Japanese address to have it shipped to, then mails it from Japan to you). They sold out quickly - I’m not sure if they’ll do another online sale or not - hopefully they can answer you :). aaa thank you!! yeah I was super prepared!! I'm usually good at first come first serve but I was nervous because of the language;;. no problem!! yeah there's lots of cool stuff on there!! I never knew about this marketplace before * U*. they're gorgeous!! My bro keeps playing w legos instead of doing his thesis and my mom goes, “honey, are you gonna save the forest or design planes?”. /rolls around WHYS THERE NOTHING COOL TO DO ON NEW YEARS. I HAVE AN ADDRESS I CAN SEND U A PANTONe POSTCARD>>>>>. my valentine card is getting increasingly stupid. huge problem:
I want to send everyone i know a pantone postcard
however i also want to keep them all for myself. ah, he's on the same listing as the full band (so that I could easily offer the option of both at a discount)! sorry for the confusion! . wouldn't it just be so funny if they made mari x luka and adrien x kagami endgame. no worries!! . feel like i didn't do shit today but now my dog is cuddling and snoring on me and i can't possibly move. mom: do you want pizza rolls?
me: yeah!! just a few
 
mom: what do you want?

mom: do you know what you want yet sweetie?
me: PIZZA?????? ROLLS????????????????????? genuinely not sure what is happening rn but it's 2 AM and I was tired at 12 but no one wanted to go to bed so I said well and started drawing again.

Still looking forward to the BNHA movie but it just sucks that it’s literally impossible not to get spoiled. Oh I’m sure it will, just not sure when. It only just came out in Japan so it’ll be at least a few months..I think last time it was Japan in July US in September ? Don’t quote me tho. Not a spoiler bc everyone dies eventually, my friend.

Ahah I’m glad I’m not the only one ! They’re not /that/ different but I am Weak . hhhhhhh i h8 charm templates. does someone who's made multi-upright standees w zap wanna answer a stupid question for me? I think your gut is right - Galo is cute but not particularly special/different unless you gave him some tech or smth? but dark Lio and Kray are good calls I think they'd be popular. gotta do 2019 art meme but i am Concerned I won't have finished pieces for lots of the months dfgfg. not like i wasn't making stuff but maybe just like,, it was a chibi or a pattern or smth too different to compare.

Thank you again for your support thus far! https:// twitter.com/cambrasine/sta tus/1205346876708605952   …. Day 2 of 3 of me putting effort into my appearance  pic.twitter.com/vtlDN9r5Uw.

THANK YOUU I’ve had them a long time and never wear them so I’m trying to change that . Wait for it pic.twitter.com/bKQmCPVw9W. Yikes I know some of these other artists I’m gonna message them. Done! I understand artists having different feelings on their work being resold but /marking it up/ (and 3x at that!) is...yeah no . Me: I’ll see who else’s art is on here, I’m sure I’ll recognize more
Shop: (my merch)
Me: Oh.... There’s usually two extra idk but we had mixed two boxes, not sure what happened . Yeah . In reaction to Recent Events: I would like to kindly request that if you resell merch you bought from me, please sell it for the same or less than you got it, *especially* if it’s something that I still stock! Credit would be great, too, since it can help increase the visibility. of my work and possibly lead to direct sales of other merch which supports me, too! 

Shit happens - you need money, fall out of a fandom, collection is overflowing - I get it, I’m not gonna say you can’t resell but - and I know this isn’t eloquent - upcharging just sucks :(. Don’t wanna make a fuss, I acknowledge that I don’t have control over what happens to my art once it goes out, but I figure it doesn’t hurt to state my preferences in hopes that if you appreciate what I create, you’ll respect my (and other artists’) wishes   Thanks for reading! I think it’s obvious but just to be clear this is my own opinion, for my own merch. I don’t speak for all artists. Others may feel differently. I suggest you check with them directly - I’m sure they’ll appreciate that you care! . LRT THESE ARE SO CUTE! the official plush are really cute too TT A TT I just want to snuggle them all aaa. Semester has been over but I gotta go to my profs house and GRADE PEOPLE tomorrow!! STreSS, i'm too soft for this.

I think so too, I’m so excited for it!! Deadass hailing and this man has basketball shorts on. Do you know haleighmun on Instagram ? First artist that came to mind. Jennie doesn’t learn how to say “no” part 453829271. 4:46 PM? It’s Pajama Hours. Diane . Talk to me in a week though and that’ll prob be the answer .

Trigger Warnings for LOTS OF THINGS.. 

TW kidnapping , rape , abuse , ???? , satanism ????? DEMONS?S???????????? i'm??????????? ????????? I can't unread this and i'm going to be thinking about it forever pic.twitter.com/ixs3GzwU0D.

LMFAOO THIS IS HARD I REALLY DIDNT FINISH  SOME SHIT HUH. My #summaryofart2019  is ...CHAOTIC.
I'm not sure what to say.. I made other work that seemed too different to compare, like patterns, creatures, etc.. I didn't want to include chibis/merch but I had to LMFAOO
In the end I just did whatever I wanted..idk whether that's good or not pic.twitter.com/TGx2b2ne7i. As usual here's the whole shebang #summaryofart  from 2013-2019 pic.twitter.com/0kEWlCtt28. here's one that's just faces cause it looks better LOOOL

Sending you good vibes!! Ehh we were gonna all spend New Years together but Adam and Sara peaced out to NY last minute .. first new year I’m not spending w my ex too since uhhh 2013 (even tho we were just friends last year). Anyway I couldn’t find my slippers so I decided to check under my bed and I did not find them but I did find a pair of socks, two different single socks, and the missing slipper to another pair ....so yeah that checks out. I JUST CHANGED MY ICON FROM MY SELF-INSERT MEW MEW TO LIO A COUPLE DAYS AGO AND I WAS LOOKING AT REPLIES TO A PIECE OF ART I JUST SAW FOR THE FIRST TIME AND I WAS LIKE WAIT I DIDN'T REPLY TO THIS and apparently this other account has it as their icon and i was so fucking confused. wave of confusion went like this: "did I not remember doing this??? what's wrong with me?!.. wait no it was only four hours ago, I definitely didn't do it...is someone impersonating me? hacking me?....is twitter glitching? wait that's not even my icon anymore". I think it was only so confusing bc it's not like...any of the popular anime characters I draw it's like...m..me????????? LOOOL. what's even more confusing is I don't follow this person, they don't follow me, no one I follow follows them, there is 0 evidence of them interacting with that post at all, ???????????????????? LMFAAO KURAAAAODFGhn. I'm not like upset I just got REALLY confused! their whole thing is they really like purple - that's cool, me too. I guess I should be flattered they think it's THAT cute but where did they get it? or they just saved it + ran? I'd ask for credit but they don't even have a bioso. i am day 2 of 5 hours of sleep but i refuse to go to bed before midnight should i take a 7 pm nap like a fool?????? can't have my last tweet of the year (decade??????) calling myself a fool !!   uhh ok let's see...do it jenn!! idk what that is but!! do it!!

I’ll drop off my kids just in case any of them float your boat~~ pic.twitter.com/pW5qlnKZgI. Anyway you should always strive to improve but remember Change takes time! A process! If you feel like you’re failing in a day, a week, a month, please remember that. Good luck to everyone whether you have clear resolutions, goals, or are just seeing what the new year brings! (Eating delicious chocolate cake)

It’s soooo pretty + this enthusiastic Kirishima will give me renewed strength to take on this year   Thank you!!!

I’m also picturing Kirishima saying ur cuss-filled tweet bc he spent too much time w Bakugo+I think that concept is v funny  pic.twitter.com/LKS8SqPaUP. (PS My kiri doodle-from-friends collection is currently at 16, in case anyone was wondering~~~~ ). facts!!! maybe someday I'll post a collage of them ahha. can I get college credits for this. I HAD LIMITED CHARACTERS OK

Let Kirishima Say Fuck 2020. Do you think postal workers see my package doodles and go “oh that’s cute” or “this bitch again”
Those are the only two options. I’ll print this out and bring it to the dean thanks. I’m sure she’ll appreciate that. Ahaha good to know! If only she worked in my town . Holy shit that’s amazing. Omg
(Charm bracelet could be cute too!!). I got more sleep than I have in a couple weeks and yet why 
Am I nap. I’m tired but it’s completely unjustified (slept longer and later than I have been recently)

there’s still like 5 hours til we go into Boston to pick them up. Y’all does this mean I do neither or do both. Yes!!Think I’m gonna replace nap w shower cause cleaning is dusty . A good idea but now I’m on a roll. Smart!! I’ve found 5000 projects to do within cleaning my desk now though, I think I’ll keep busy . The bag I saved con pamphlets and badges in is filled to bursting, I gotta make a binder before they end up all over the floor . I wonder is it better to sort my con badges by convention then by year, or totally chronologically.. Omg that new year’s resolution . This is actual size. He blew away in a light breeze and I never saw him again. Microdad. themed photography studios they have in touristy places..) and then you get to take photos and THEN u get the maid cafe experience and if this doesn’t already exist it should and if it does how do I get there??? I had a dream where at the mall there was a maid cafe type thing but instead it was like...it was a make up bar + either do it yourself or a cute employee would put it on for you and they had tons of cool options, then they had different outfits you could wear (kinda like those. Quick give me a couple hundred thousand I can make this happen. In the context of my dream tho there was a huge group. the guys were like NOICE IS THIS LIKE HOOTERS + the girls were like WAIT GO FUCK YOURSELF THIS IS FOR ME (Sorry for the Heteronormativity  ) then the guys wanted to participate so they had girlfriends/maids do them up too. They were super nice when I had a problem. They’ll probably offer to replace them with your next order or smth - they did that w me and gave extra. oh no i just had a good idea
i wanna do this ks in a few months but i'm worried no one will care bc it's still original and cute but it's not like *~~ kawaii pastel u wu ~~*. LMFAOO as if there's any room for it. (I  mean I wanted to do a KS for this already but then I had a good idea of another thing that could be included). me, looking at manus, talking to myself: minimum order here is 50..that's a lot more doable...
mom: she is so cute! jennie is always onto the next thing! she is so adorable!

My headache is in a really specific spot so I pulled and twisted my hair there and now I have this one big wave pic.twitter.com/V9gQ0NCDol. y'all ever think about how bishounencon happened that one time. We watched a home video where my bro was like 2 and he’s toting around books and my mom goes “What a little bookworm! You’re going to be a scholar! Harvard or Yale?” And anyway the answer ended up being Brown   He almost got his masters at Yale but they were being cheap .  Wow!! That’s so kind of you! I’m glad you enjoy it that much!! Wanna wear this again in the spring when I don’t have to style it so dark bc I’m freezing my butt off ( dress on loan from @grimmfirefly  and yes I ignored your suggestions in favor of comfort sorry love u) pic.twitter.com/XQgtmTbJ7R.  eeeee thank you friend.

Mom: and for both you get a /tip/, get it 
Me: jandjdnBSNDJDMDNX

Ok goodnight. Made myself to wake up@1 so I wouldn’t get totally thrown off but couldn’t motivate myself out of bed for 2 more hours, there’s no food in the house and I’m soo hungry so I’m gonna get junk food.sometimes when u gotta go to the airport@2 AM u just have to call a day a loss. Haha yikes. Is it small at least or a big boy. Frankly this is an abomination, it goes against everything I stand for pic.twitter.com/tP14T71k4o.

I was just thinking I feel sick after half a candy bar and that thing is Insane ahah. not sure what happened but all my saved passwords are gone pour 100594366 out. @ Anime Conventions, please: Put your artist alley application dates on your website - not exclusively on your Facebook, or Twitter, or some  email list! It's really not that much to ask!  . Like bruh some people do this for their livelihoods! Others of us don't but maybe we still just don't wanna have to check all the social media accounts of dozens of conventions in order to not get burned sgfdg. As a follow up, a day or two is not sufficient notice!! I usually check every two weeks and even then there's always a couple I miss >:(. Especially if you're having your sign ups like /months/ different from when you usually do...

Anyway, rant over!

P.S. This wasn't all aimed at one con btw just things we've all experienced over the years. finding that massive old hard drive was such a blessing I'm now listening to the music stylings of American Hi-Fi, Motion City Soundtrack, Hawthorne Heights, etc. Sound on...... pic.twitter.com/kvpIfWGBBq. we were very sleep deprived bc my bro's gf's flight was at 4 AM, please pity me. Update! LEDs should get to me in the next few days. Stage stands are looking like Feb since I decided to get a prototype to approve - it’s more complex than usual + both you + I are spending a good lil chunk of money on it!!

I am Shocked in the best way possible. ITS PROB OBNOXIOUS TO REPLY LIKE HEY IM THE ARTIST but people were asking so......hey. I FIND THE TIKTOK /DEEPY FUNNY// but I'm surprised it's doing numbers??? It's gone up like 2,000 likes in this hour. me: Should I make my Kickstarter in "fashion" or "art"?
@grimmfirefly  : You should make it in February
me: That wasn't--------. I now have 17 whole tiktok followers to disappoint. I feel like I already make tiktoks except they’re my Instagram stories LMFAOO. this renovation show is confusing me the couple is so agreeable?? even when they disagree nothing is a problem??  it's wild? I prefer that obviously but I'm just surprised, did no one tell them to be awful and dramatic? DFSGFDG "It's 1:.....65........." - My mom reading the channel number instead of the time. I’m losing my mind but I think I really like this drawing and it’s weird but I’m like I wonder how this would look if I redraw it five years from now yknow. I don’t know the whole situation but generally in my experience none to few people are upset and you make yourself sick for nothing dndjdj I hope it all works out and I’m glad you’re feeling better!! BABIES!! Still waiting on stage sample, but LED only orders will go out soon! 

If you want to grab one go to  http:// cambrasine.art/shop-all     

There’s literally a few extra Lio left atm, will restock for March cons most likely. Meis was a special request  pic.twitter.com/BLD4nNMdto. MEIS LOOKS SO CUTE BUT I DIDN'T GET ONE OF HIM FOR MYSELF. shoutout to D*HL bc if they hadn't delivered my package two hours ago I know I would've fallen back asleep dfgdfg still off-schedule > A<. Alright. LED Lio Only folks -- Your packages: they're may look bad on the outside! LOL

They're too big for my usual mailers. Some will be in the few cute mailers I have, others will be frankenstein'd mailers. The contents will be safe, and super cute! <3. They all have 8 settings: 7 Colors (Red, Yellow, Light Green, Green, Aqua, Purple, Blue) plus a color cycling mode! . Deeply soothing pic.twitter.com/diLiTDAJ8T. Whoooo just made it through our walk before the snow squall . You look great!!   Glam!!! Omg!! A Safe Bakugou for good luck!   Thanks so much for your support!! sdGFGH I asked my mom to guess how much extra shipping I had to pay and she was like $200?! 

narrator: it was 45 cents. anyway rn I have it set to charge y'all exactly at cost but uh mailers, labels, ink, tape, etc. cost Money, I may change it to add like 25 or 50 cents or smth;;. It says this in the email but give it a few days for tracking to show up before contacting me~ I normally ship Saturdays but i'm on break rn so i'm just doing for it but I can't get them all done in one go so!! Filling orders in “what’s easiest to pack” order . mom: these burgers are going to be huge..
me: what do you expect? you got the uhh the..what were they called? big beefy pub boys?
mom: .....bigger, better pub burgers. alright, i'm going into the meat industry everyone----

(no I could never  ). Hey hey no spoilers but is knives out like very suspenseful ? It’s not horror -like right? I should’ve done more research. I haven’t watched the trailer in 45 years. Aaa ok great I thought so it’s just been a while since I saw the trailer and I got nervous as I was heading out lmfaoo thank you so much! I scheduled exactly one fun activity for myself (a movie tonight) so I only got about a dozen packages done for the morning but maybe I’ll still have energy after! The woman next to me at Knives Out was drinking strong-smelling wine and I had to ask myself if I was viewing this in 4DX. THAT WAS SOOO FUCKING GOOD THO sometimes I see ages of hype and then I don’t feel impressed but wow I got to legally see a whole ass masterpiece for $0 thanks to an employee error. Also since it was shot here I spent all the scenery shots going “ohh, that’s familiar where’s that again~” . Now excuse me while I RT fanart. Aaa yes I totally recognized it I was like ( knives out spoiler below )

is Chris Evans being frisked in my old apartments driveway LMFAOOO (I am exaggerating but u get the idea). sfdgdg y'all are too kind , thank you and thank you!! . sdfgdfh I feel bad but I'm also trying to get as many out as quickly as possible and thus (gestures to this system). sleepy but
wanted to
get more done
what do. OK I'm gonna keep the original instructions in with the LED bases but I also made my own bc the og instructions leave smth to be desired. > open twitter 
> see this shit
> close twitter. Aaa it’d be cute to make merry+octopi candy charm!! But I assume those are too expensive for original merch . My website: ships on saturdays :)
My listings: ships January/February 
No one:
Absolutely no one:
Me, mid-week, early January: IM SORRY EVERYONE iM sLOW i’LL gET thEm DoNe SOon. Bro this place made my mom email them back in forth, phone interview, two hour interview with three different people and then writes saying not that they are hiring her or went with someone else but that they reviewed their workload and don’t need to hire /anyone/. Don’t do that. THE FACE IS SO SWEET i love. MMM I packed most of the LED only orders but I am short,,,, FOUR mailers!! I could send in paper bubble mailers but..it's electronic so i'm..........................................................skeptical .......... me: I wonder how much shipping is
ad: FREE SHIPPING!
me: FREE SHIPPING!!! Must eat trash while human nap. Two perfect girls combine to make..perfect girl. i think i just accidentally picked out mailers for a kickstarter that's only like 20% planned. ignoring the christmas-y-ness aren't these so cute i'm dead
putting that aside
i can easily buy eco-friendly mailers for the size I use like 95% of the time bc i buy a billion, but bigger sizes .. I need so few it gets really expensive which isn't an option rn dgsfdg pic.twitter.com/IN73ZpDGu4. DFGDG I FORGOT WHAT I REPLIED TO FOR A SEC AND I WAS LIKE 'WAIT WHAT'D I DO'. Choose your fighter

> rest, feel guilty for not being productive 
> be productive, feel guilty for being productive on the wrong things 
> be productive, feel guilty for not resting. OOOOOF,,, BRUH. FBJDVNKH THESE ARE GREAT. Snoot. Sorry if u already wrote this somewhere but pssst hey milo what kind of clay is this?? I love the ones I own from other artists and I’ve been wanting to make some for a while now too . Ohhh!! I see!! I have some of that from forever ago, I wonder if it’s still good... I agree I like white all-painted look! Yours turned out amazing!
I’ve seen some people use paper clay which is intriguing but intimidating to me hmm haha
Thanks so much for answering!! For transparency, up to this point shipping was typically charged at-cost, which did not cover mailers, tape, labels, ink, etc. It will now add .60 to shipping for domestic(US) orders to cover these costs. Int'l shipping I will continue to eat the cost cause it's expensive enough. Thanks for understanding!! <3. Also mailers for the remaining LEDs should be here tomorrow so I can get those last guys out, and I already ordered bigger mailers for the stage ones too so they can go out as soon as they arrive ( most likely feb, not jan ). > A< i'm typically 2/3. (yells) THATS SOON. Always think you’re having a fine conversation with an old shirt person and then they go and say something offensive. On today’s episode “ugh he was always into girly stuff growing up..could’ve been worse though”. Bruh 2 oz sculpey is 50% off til the 22nd (well at my local one at least). Ahh yeah I watched some paper clay videos and it’s lighter and no baking but they were using water to smooth it, then let it dry, sand it to smooth more, gesso, /then/ paint and resin so it seems a bit more intense. I kinda like lumpiness tho   I didn’t have white so I just got some fresh sculpey to try out!! WHY WOULD SOMEONE DO THIS. “Ohh sorry we can’t find u a single match because no one else was willing to do this”. Me trying to shove an expensive to produce item into this pin Kickstarter: pic.twitter.com/2d8n3o7EE2. I’ve also seen a ton for FE... some for BNHA, a few for Promare, a couple for MP100, etc. Sometimes I think I could use a button that just sends a tweet that says “almost did a thing, but was tired”. I think I made snoopy by accident pic.twitter.com/zLqU8zNw0b. Do you know how much sculpey we burned back in the day?? They’re probably not baking at all bc I’m checking them every five seconds to make sure they’re not crispy . Nothing like a light lunch before a hike  pic.twitter.com/OZ296VKsFH. Aa I’m so glad they arrived safely!! And omg yes you got a good one, some of my package doodles did not do justice to Galo’s cute lil face. hey y'all! just wanted to let you know that about 2/3 of LED only orders went out last night, and the rest will go out Monday! I ran out of big enough mailers and they arrived to me after the post office closed today;;. sure sex is great, but have you ever been on the fence about trying a new manufacturer and then you recognize one of their samples because it was made for an artist you follow. this is the second time (plush last time, and now..secret..,) and it makes me feel so much more comfortable giving them $ for a sample. WAIT I FORGOT ONE INSTANCE, this is the third time then

 and damn it feels good. my brain is Bad today, I left Cady's leash in the car when we went on our walk, then I found someone's lost glove and. I have it here. At my home. Because I forgot to leave it at the lost and found. I love that it’s warm outside except now I’m too warm inside to sleep even though the heats been off . I was excited about these but as always glazing kills me 
I’ve saved my favorites and tested glazes on the ones I didn’t like as much but they do still need to be sealed :(. Here are my kids! Well, the ones that turned out well   Most still need to be glazed but I’m holding off since I’m worried I’ll destroy them~ I did have more fun than expected sculpting+painting, I’d def recommend this activity for a change of pace, rainy day, art block, etc  pic.twitter.com/IVtNBuI1PZ. ahah Thank you! . thank you so much!! > u<. p*ntones,, a blessing and a curse. sorry friend, i'm really going through it with this orange right now. Finally got myself one of them New Years Resolutions: build up my biceps (but exclusively by playing Wii Sports and Wii Sports Resort). Ohmygod this show the family has four daughters and I ?? They must all be Instagram models they’re gorgeous and GLAMOROUS !!! Anytime I see a pretty girl I’m like?? Do I want to be you ??? Or marry you???? YES. sometimes if I forget what I was doing while on the computer I'll just go command paste and that usually reminds me. guess i'm chonking up my website to match my style lmfaoo. People are really out here incapable of just typing “LRT”. Quitting school to make lumpy clay pins with dog and paintbrush hairs stuck in em. tonight i will fall asleep before 4 or 5 AM and tomorrow night i will have the energy to finish this illustration
i am willing it into existence. it's cute seeing the english and japanese promare fandoms learn about each others nonsense. 'say I don't have the money, should I buy a sample anyway and hope the Kickstarter will pay for it later?" to the tune of this old SNL skit https://www. youtube.com/watch?v=Qb8hTz UoI54   …. @ An*me B*ston pls tell me my fate already . RNMFHDDN I almost tweeted these exact words last night omg. Shoutout to the guy that realized the text on the keyboard was going to be backwards on one side of the standee you’re the real MVP (and that’s also why you get a sample, folks). IT WAS AN AMATEUR MISTAKE haha I was like oh the base won’t be double sided so I don’t have to worry about text and forgot about that tiny text there. One day I’ll own Promare plush — official, fan, they’re all cute — but that day is not today. Sharing is caring. Honestly we’re not destitute just yet but y’all are really, really helping right now with your online orders. It’s not enough to support me/my fam entirely but I really don’t wanna think about what my bank account would look like right now without it. I’m so grateful. Thank you. mood. More kids. If you can guess who/what they are —- nothing happens but maybe you’ll be satisfied or maybe you’ll be surprised   some are not guessable though pic.twitter.com/PMH8AVNxYF. Also yes my craftsmanship leaves something to be desired but that’s also kind of the point . HAHA WHO ME??? NEVER??? 1. Sculpt
2. Bake
3. Nervously draw guides in pencil bc you don’t trust yourself pic.twitter.com/wwH4YdHgwG. Do you like how the one I was least sure about is my own fucking oc. Ohhh I am Not the person to ask!! This is the first time I’ve touched clay in years and years! I’ve only ever used polymer clay (this one is Sculpey) which you bake. There’s also paper clay (air dries, I think) which I haven’t tried yet but it’s popular too! Unfortunately I can’t be more helpful than that, probably do some research and see which has more of the qualities you’re looking for. Aaa thank you so much! I applaud my favorite RB place's social media team... pic.twitter.com/4P1TAwwKSV. It truly is
It’s also making me question whether there actually is an ongoing debate or if it was manufactured for this post. I killed tamaki.....I try to fix. Most of them survived...will take pics in the light and post tomorrow pic.twitter.com/bz8ZHoncS3. YES IT IS. I made a couple more neopets but they were Not Up To Par . ok officially paid for a sample for a new kind of item, send good vibes! also pls buy it----- haha just kidding.....unless? Always playing a game of chicken w my period bc the meds work better the earlier I take them but if I take them and it was a false alarm then I can’t take more yet when I’m really in it. 0 promises on drawing this bc school is Coming and I’m so not ready but I do wanna see this so please humor me pic.twitter.com/KPQAkB6COt. I like the way you think ;) . @ pandycanes  y’all doubled me up on species so now by law you’re each obligated to throw me a clothing suggestion   sorry I don’t make the rules~~. JK were on names now. Omg that’s outta left field   pun intended. i had really strong visions for the rest of them but i sure am just making up guiera's face as i go. You must be trying to kill me huh . I had to google this but I love him look at that snoot. Update I did not win this round ouch.  aaa these are such nice photos!! It was no problem, I also have a soft spot for him so I was happy to accommodate! Thank you again! Ahaha I was so nervous I’d get him lost in the sea of Lios so I did this, but even then I put it in and out the mailer like 3 times to read it “just to make sure” before sealing it . Portfolio day again, time to play everyone’s favorite game: feeling inspired or feeling inadequate. LMFAOOO hint: it’s both. The survivors of my last batch of clay pins!   Most of them pulled through!!!  

PS Someday I’ll own Posca fineliners but for now I’m struggling along w the chonky boys pic.twitter.com/PUmUtNSq26. 1st Image: My OC, Kiri, Tamaki (who I revived)

3rd Image: Shoyru, @lolstasia  ‘s chef bear ( GO PREORDER THE T-SHIRT), and a pastel rainbow Dalmatian. I love!! Chef bear!! As long as I don’t destroy it while glazing — he’s yours next time our paths cross! . Oof Can’t relate. RHRNSIND this is amazing but my favorite part is the implication that he swallowed them whole. THATS SO CHAOTIC Ohmygod. chonkification of my site is complete. as usual please let me know if i damaged something critical in my renovations bc that's kind of my trademark. cady drank my water again :( rude. DFGFJHYJcgf my mom tried to say yayoi (kusama) and said yaoi by mistake. me: I'll send this email tonight - it's late so I can deal with the files tomorrow
manu: (writes back to me at 9 PM PST)
me: haha what the fuck. i ...really wanted to send out valentines day cards to mutuals but......i don't know if i can.....AFFORD TO dSGFHJJ. This paper I've got already is pretty good and I was impressed with how my little LED guides printed... I wonder how my home printer would do with this design... Old habits die hard huh . Now I know how parents feel when they’re kids pick up saying “fuck”. (finishing touches on an illustration i've been popping back and forth to for like 4 weeks)
:)
(flip horizontal)
oh....oh no.........................no........... ok just... no one flip this drawing when i post it please.. i'll k-word u. I need financial security who cares about food and shelter I need that fat Galo plush. This is a prime 3-4 hours of sleep tweet my brain is working better than ever I am high functioning. “I’m a mastermind. Completely undetectable” - Your dad, probably. Why are you doing this to me, huh? . A stick just fell out of my hair.. not a beautiful picture but it was a nice walk pic.twitter.com/1s6P9QQH8O. ...an enigma. i'm *hoping* my stage stand sample will arrive next week but I know they were busy from their holiday break/sales > A< i'm soooo impatient! Ahaha That caption is Relatable  I’m glad he arrived safely, thank you so much for your support!!  so glad I could make these lil guys!! Also just FYI  on the instruction card - I love Guiera too I just didn’t have his face done when I sent these out . I am
Fatigued. Mom: (gestures to food left on my plate) What’s going on with that?
Me: It’s been chosen..
Mom: Chosen? Chosen for what?
Me: Chosen ..to be saved. darn! waitlisted for momo > A< I wanna go baaaack~. I've been waitlisted and let in before but this year and last they said my position isn't probably good enough to get in guhhh. getting in is so impossible these days > A< I wish I was born a few years earlier LOL. I WORKED HARD TO FINISH MY DRAWING AND AND WHEN I TEST POST IT TWITTER TOTALLY DESATURATES IT?? like it looks fine when i upload but after i hit tweet it's like haha go fuck yourself jenn (desaturates). uh ok guess i'll be posting a jpeg????? [RTs ] More Mad Burnish Band AU

I've said 'This drawing k*lled me' before but y'all... this time I MEAN IT! I've been looking at this on/off for WEEKS...please clap

You can buy this as a print@ http:// cambrasine.art    + I'll have it for Zenkaikon pic.twitter.com/mIs7pLG0dB. THANK YOU SO MUCHDNNDNX. My other big Mad Burnish fan art was lineless and super shape-y so I decided to go a totally different direction for this one for more of like a band poster/graphic novel cover kinda vibe!!  In the end I don’t think I can really prefer one or the other they’re just so Different. Sara I spent 19644863688 hours on this and it’s your fault thanks. Aaa I’m glad he went to such a loving home!!!   thank you for your support !! Ahah my friend brought up the idea but I’ve had fun bringing it to life !  I love Thyma she deserved better. Aaa   you’re too kind!!! Thank you! Aaa thank you so much!  Feels good to hear someone else say it ahah I was having an identity crisis like “which style is more genuinely me” but it’s like YOU FOOL THEYRE BOTH YOU BC YOU DREW THEM BoTH   Ahah me too but replaying Kakusei will have to cut it for now. Hnn I’ve never had it happen before! I got it to work by saving as a different file type but it was very odd. I think about this a lot pic.twitter.com/6hhC6Kmwnk. I am haruhi / the twins. lrt illustrators are truly an amazing species i love seeing people apply their illustration skills to other mediums like clay and textile,,, I LOVE IT. (softly) now i kinda wanna try.,,,, punch needling,,, fake some fuzzy boys. ..........i do still have that blick giftcard (Eyes emoji). Its so windy I can like feel it coming in from the wood stove..... I took Cady out to pee and she looked up at me with fear in her eyes like “please..let’s go back..”. update I have watched some videos and I am moderately intimidated......but I still wanna try bc this seems like it could be used as a handmade (and less of a huge financial risk) version of chenille patches. omg that thing'll weigh 20 pounds by the time you're done. hehe i'm making a little surprise to go with acrylic stands it's stupid but cute!! gotta do smth to keep busy while I wait for the sample hahah. pretty sure you're obligated by law to weigh it at the end of this process. I will eagerly await the results. Meanwhile I wish you fingers all the best because hoo-boy that looks like one hell of a task. nah, I've tried felting and uh...we don't get along.
punch needling is like embroidery.. it looks like latch hooking but seems to be 1000 times less painful. Yeah!! I’m curious how difficult it is or not to get it to look the way you want. Aaaa congratulations!! Looks like such a nice porch to hang out on . OH I think I saw this man one time. I’ll pray for u . (He’s looking Amazing tho tbh). oopsies I always forget about metrocon.. I get a lot of orders from Florida but for some reason going there feels like a huge task. I’m sure I’m not the only one but on things big and small (objects, opportunities, etc) I’ll want and want so badly if I can’t have it or it’s not looking good, and then, if things change and I can have it, I feel like I can’t commit or wonder if I ever /really/ wanted it. Ahh it goes the other way around too though! Like recently I got tied into something I thought I didn’t wanna do and then when it was cancelled I was disappointed. Ndhdjdnssn im sorry this was relatable for you. Ahh yeah I think that’s accurate. “Do u only cook this one food” - my followers, seeing this pizza for what must be the fourth or fifth time 
“Yes” - me pic.twitter.com/kjZc6ERKl3. (Burps) o-oops We would’ve saved some . Omg “mr Katsuki” are u interning under him mai. But haven’t you heard the consequences aren’t real as long as u said the things via a screen :). Lrt damn know what I’m being for Halloween. Also the other day I thought mrs Maisel would be a fun costume but then I realized there would be pressure to PERFORM. Also I’ve done nothing like three Halloween’s straight now. got hit w a wave of Sleepy which would be good if i didn't just eat like half a pizza, pasta, and dessert > N<. As usual my process was Very Chaotic TM pic.twitter.com/oyfkevQElm. rollr*und is a great example of what I aspire for tbh. me, for hours: it's too early to sleep
the clock, all of a sudden: ITS 2 AM. SGDFHFGH fuck,
we should
go to sleep
Now. (Tucks you in) bed time!!! THESE LOOK CRAZY COOL. Ohhhh I wrote to this company asking if there was any other option for shipping bc I didn’t wanna pay $6 to fedex ground /one ribbon/ (sample) and they’re sending it for free   noice!!!! ergtseEDSG this birthday doodle is so cute but i feel like i gotta wait til it's delivered to post. oof nothing like running out of sleeves, big mailers, labels, and ink at the same time, rip bank account. TFW one of the two cons you have for Spring..has to change the date...to the weekend of the one other con.......................... . It's not their fault, it was out of their control, but Wow that SUCKS!! I wanted to hang w my local con friendos at QCK but I gotta go to Zenk!! I love Zenkai too!! But investment/size/sales-wise I don't really have a choice. I love them both for diff reasons so I'm just bummed. ...........(slides u even more tissues). gimme  pic.twitter.com/C6aV2gaEfM. GOING ON THIS WEBSITE WAS A MISTAKE ohmygod pic.twitter.com/3ESh6t4I71. Looking at the budget my bro outlined for us but he must have made a mistake because there’s no money allotted for Sanrio merch? In other news both places my mom was in touch w for /months/ decided not to hire anyone   but she had an interview today and has a phone interview in a few days and both those jobs pay Well so send good vibes . (BASKS IN THE EXCELLENT VIBES). Eeeeep thank you friend! i was trying to get punch needle supplies before the Storm but it's ridiculously impossible :( the literal only place I could find it is 45 mins away.. I found more of that good paper so I think I'll be able to do Valentines after all! They won't be fancy but yknow,. revealed - it’s MX-11. Then there was an intermission and they were like “movies broken come back next week to finish it”
Anyway this is all canon now so enjoy
Ps after i changed my pants on a train platform+ was SNL castrates w Pete Davidson and man whose name I forgot. Gnight. Had a dream I went to see a Promare sequel. The overarching plot was unclear but it was full of tropes so like Galos fighting who knows who, who knows why - and 2/3 of the way thru Lio shows up in burnish armor including a weird like medieval looking crown and galos like THANK. GOODNESS UR HERE TO HELPME  LIO WHERE HAVE U BEEN but then you see he’s got those classic glazed over mine control eyes and he fights his bf :( His backstory is revealed but I missed it bc I was distracted w smth in the theater. His terrible ID number from Foresight labs is. ^********CASTMATES CASTMATES CASTMATES WHAT A TERRIBLE TYPO. Lrt I am speechless. This month’s just flown by ...school starts in a few days pic.twitter.com/JgxhZdfu67. Ohh my spring break is kinda early this year..I wonder when Adam will be done w his thesis and come home for a hot second...also yes I’m already so distressed that I’m looking for my next break . RIGHT??? Not that I was gonna but it but...It’s sold out . I don’t speak English anymore only memes pic.twitter.com/y4pVIF7C6P. (Gives u more tissues) I hope you feel better soon . Sundae in a snowstorm  pic.twitter.com/y9kDONCI2t. Aaa the key is not to start overdoing it when you start to feel better! It’s tempting but if you overdo it you’ll start to feel worse again   I hope you really are starting to get better tho!! I’m on board  
(For real tho holy shit this Galo  ). please i'm uncoordinated. omw u can practice on me :). doing that fun thing where i destroy my lower lip bc i'm stressed abt school starting. dsfgfdg thank u friend....must..control..anxious habit. Shhh!!! they’ll hear you!! aaa that's a good idea!! I'll try to come up w smth less destructive to keep busy. THIS MEME...WAS FUN!!! It's a good warm up

I wasn't sure which the goal was - if it was to draw in my style then I didn't really do that - I clearly traced to keep proportions more semi-realistic - but I tried to give it some of the blobby flair my art usually has ahaha  #toonme pic.twitter.com/ByBCNrogsQ.

An old classmate posted a picture of her bf cuddling with her rabbit how do I get that huh. “Are you asking how do you get a boyfriend, how do you get rabbit cuddles, or how do you get a boyfriend that cuddles your rabbit?”
“Yes”. Every time I read the manga I’m Shocked at their cuteness bc of this. I can’t believe we’re at a point where call outs replace ?? Customer service emails???!??? Come home and theresjust chocolate burning on the stove ok mom. She got a call from a job recruiter apparently but uh if I hadn’t happened to quit my walk early that would’ve been a big yikes (she’s still downstairs now..). “oh SHIT I forgot!!”
“Do I need to get you a LifeAlert”. Anyway Camp Counselor AU: Galo is a lifeguard at the lake, Lio teaches archery and makes the best bonfires. Idk what Meis and Guiera do but they are There and they are Chaotic. My mom was trying to cheer me up before bed last night and give me GaloLio scenarios to dream about and we ended up w some awful conversations (thread). > What’s hot.. a sauna..
> A..sauna isn’t a whole AU. They what, go to the same gym?
> A spa.
> ok but like—-
> Yeah and Lios wearing a little towel
> what is this rated 
> I said he’s wearing a towel! > Oh! Galo is a lifeguard! 
> That’s a popular AU.. and what is Lio? Just drowning?
> Yeah cause he’s weak to water 
> In the movie they fight with ice though not water
> ok the ice cracks
> wait why is Galo lifeguarding a frozen lake
> idk but he’s on skates and he swoops him up. > Galo works at a vintage clothing store
> ...and Lio is a customer there. He says I need a cravat, stat
> Crop top
> (laughing) no I said /cravat/
> I know but I said crop top. he wants to change his look. 80’s crop top. ....wait no Galo would be wearing that already.. And my favorite:
> .....food truck AU
> / FOOD TRUCKS??/ What, they just Park next to each other?!
> yeah ..what kind of food truck would Lio have....Mac n cheese..like that truck at Anime NYC
> you don’t even know you just referenced the film do u. > and Galo? Is he..is he just an ice cream man?
> yeah he serves dairy whip. Yknow cause his hairs kinda goes whoosh
> and Kray popsicles with gum ball eyes
> but they’re melting. Ohh!!! yeah! I feel like they’d be good for all that like uhh climbing and obstacle course stuff too?  

(Ah that’s so nice! I never went to overnight camp bc Anxiety but I know some stuff!). LMFAOOO THIS IS PERFECT I love it. Mm Thyma does first aid..Ignis runs the camp..Aina..???????? I can see Guiera getting his campers lost in the woods tbh. Me: (flopping between months old wips) I gave up on the one I was workin on and switched back to this one
Mom: ooh I love that one
Me: I know I wish it was DONE. “Look at these little bitches“ - my mom proudly presenting chicken cordon bleu. /pats you. IT'S.. IT'S GOOD TO BE THOUGHTFUL THO!! I guess..it's good to..make things you're happy with even if it means making less things?! but I agree people are just like

It took me a minute to process but like half the audience /noticeably gasped/ when Taki appeared . Lrt (crying my eyes out cause I want that giant eyed Lio). Also I saw Promare so many fucking times that my chicken fingers were free tonight LMFAOOO. Wahhh I thought I could get some orders out but now my buttons and labels are delayed, so now it’ll prob all be here Friday but I have —— (whispers) class. Lrt I can’t afford to keep going to my school so now I have to spend like $100 apply to other schools to *see* if they give me better financial aid *if* I get in . Lmfaoooo ok well my mom was going to sign papers today and the recruiter calls, apologizes saying the guys flakey and changed his mind abt hiring her....

That’s the 3rd one to fall through and we always say things come in 3’s so (big sigh). We also had legit /seven people/ trying to buy our treadmill and THEY ALL FLAKED TOO everyone’s so fucking fickle grr. Haha sure would love not to be stressed about money again,, that was a nice couple years there after yknow the entirety of my childhood. the way I feel abt my drawings lately is 'one day i'll be good enough to fix this'. LRT LMFAOOOO YALL JUST GONNA GET SOAKED OR WHAT. Yknow when snow does that thing tho (don’t RT) pic.twitter.com/oep5lRkFGH. hey sounds like a good time to me https:// twitter.com/Gizmodo/status /1220485980454604801   …. Just realized I have to!!!

Coincidence?????

(Yes). an*me b*st*n a few weeks ago: it'll probably be a few more weeks
an*me b*st*n today: it'll probably be a few more weeks. found a secret pocket on a backpack I got last summer when looking for a place to hang an inosuke charm. I thought candy bag charms must be expensive to make but?? everyone seems to be making them??? so maybe not???? i bought this backpack......6 months ago DSGFH. oh. huh. that's not as much as I thought. but it must matter how many lil guys (acrylic pieces) ya put in there too.. hnn yeah like $5 doesn't sound insane but then you MMULTIPLY
mm ok i'll make one w like 5 acrylic pieces and 3 kinds of glitter -- there will be no way to shake it bc there will be NO ROOM FOR THINGS TO MOVE. i have class in nine hours but i am DETERMINED TO FINISH THIS DRAWING BEFORE MY BREAK ENDS. YA EVER SPEND A MILLION YEARS ON A DRAWIG AND THEN REALIZE

YO U DREW THE SCAR ON THE WRONG SIDE????? c..c.c.c.cCASUALLY FLIPS HORIZONTAL. man I like his scar and even tho it looks good flipped horizontally (yay) I'm just..used to seeing the drawing one way so..sorry bby no face scar u nu. Reunion will come.

NO.6 / Nezushi will always have a special place in my heart. This is based on a toi8 illustration / the ED. I originally began this drawing in 2015. After a few restarts and years-long break, I'm happy to call this done  

Will have this print at Zenkaikon pic.twitter.com/mqa81es4lr. I MET MY COMPLETELY ARBItrary SELF IMPOSED DEADLINE time for (checks clock) a shower, 4 hours of sleep, rush hour train, and a studio class!!! THANK YOU THANK YOU (TAKES A BOW). also - for fun - 2015 version and the prelim sketch of this version from June (oops haha)

Happy to see they’re still loved . 2 hours of sleep but I got a solo seat on the train . Aaa thank you so much!!! I’m glad to hear I achieved the softness I was aiming for . Omg yesss 
I feel like it’s underrated, Its a little bit older now but I think if it came out today it’d be popular !  thank you! I THOUGHT IT WAS. OHH I WONDER IF ANY OF MY PACKAGES WILL BE WAITING FOR ME WHEN I GET HOME. Stolen content: my bro losing his mind working on his thesis part 183840582 pic.twitter.com/v4McB5faCY. ahaha as if I’ll do anything but open them go “ooh” then immediately take a nap . I’d never say no haha. Buttons are here!!! I’ll work on orders after lunch/nap hopefully I can get most of not all out tomorrow. UH SO MY SAMPLE CAME AND IT LOOKS??? FREAKING AWESOME!!!  

There’s still some of these Mad Burnish stage stands + LED Lio (2nd photo) up for grabs at  http:// cambrasine.art/shop   

I’ll try to have a few for Zenkaikon + AX but since they’re expensive to make it’ll be a bit tricky pic.twitter.com/ckAlNOmOjL. I wanna nap but construction is crazy loud today dhdndnd. THANK YOU!! I’m so impressed w the colors and everything tbh, it was worth the wait .  thank you so much!! waitin for the room to warm up then I'm packing all the orders I can!! u vu. ohmygod. this fucking guy decided to hired my mom, changed his mind /the next day/ before she signed the papers, and now he has cHANGED HIS MIND AGAIN. So like??

Thank you so much!! . I was going to be lazy but someone requested I update my poster listing online so ..it's up!  http:// cambrasine.art/shop-all   pic.twitter.com/EQt7frP9b3. woah. Yeah she’s gonna take it for now cause it’s Desperate Hours and the pay is good but she’s still sending out resumes and keeping in touch w other people..can’t imagine working for someone chaotic like this (he also changed the pay, benefits, and hours lmfaooo). Happy Lunar New Year to those who celebrate! Look - I drew a rat  https:// twitter.com/cambrasine/sta tus/1220585718550089728   …. I’m sorry I couldn’t pass the opportunity to make this stupid joke but really happy new year rndndj. I love her.  doki. My favorite part is when Hodaka turns, looks into the camera, and says “ba-da-ba-ba-ba~ I’m lovin’ it”. Ps if you got your tracking last night your package has been dropped off! . I’m trying to generate more possible ideas for this assignment but my brain came up with 1 thing + is totally stuck on it
Anyway if you happen to have any ideas regarding “portraits” HMU   broadly interpreted (portraits of dogs, portraits of people via their favorite food, etc). My idea rn is 1. Gonna make me sad for 8 weeks 2. Not something that fits my usual style /portfolio so it’s not ideal. UHHHH AAAAAA IVS NEVER HAD CLASSES ON FRIDAY BEFORE AND IM REALIZING THAT ONE OF THE TWO GIANT PROJECTS THAT MAKE UP THE ENTIRE COURSE IS PRESENTED ON THE FRIDAY OF ZENKAI
When I will be
In Pennsylvania. The problem is the week before is spring break, two weeks before wouldn't be enough time,  and the full class doesn't even meet except for presentation days as it is.. orz Hopefully we can come up with something.. sdgsg I wrote the professor .. I had her last semester and she gave me an A, and she seems understanding ..hoping we can figure something out ....cause I can't afford not to go to the con but I also can't afford to uhh fail a class. Yeah, the class only met for the first time yesterday so hopefully we can figure something out!! the absolute tonal whiplash of my two project proposals.. She wrote back already and was like jenn chill LMFAOO no but she was very supportive, we’re good, phew. Or u post anyway and you’re full of regert. Sound on to here me in utter delight of Lio Fotia on my screen pic.twitter.com/sN6C0c7sI2. *hear . bajillions of dogs are starving on the streets and yet at 2 PM I have to bribe Cady to eat her food using shredded cheese. There's still some room so don't be shy! https:// twitter.com/cambrasine/sta tus/1218767146186092544   …. Rainbow!! pic.twitter.com/3vkzvH7voQ. Aw dang almost had enough rewards for a free switch lite but I decided to be a responsible adult and get ink . Mood   sending u good vibes!! lrt me someday. ahaha oh no we've spoiled them rotten huh? this melody is so beautiful https://www. youtube.com/watch?v=YxOz6l m3EdM   …. sfgsdfhg there's even a tiddie window... . asdfgfdhf I'm sorry it's been such a painful experience so far.. I hope you have safe (and peaceful) travels the rest of the way and have an AMAZING TIME WHILE YOU'RE THERE!! vive la mariessa . Found like three Michaels credits so tomorrow I will finally get ultra matte duraclear for my clay pins and it will be glorious. We live exclusively off rewards programs and store credits now, see u in hell. Tomorrow is the first day of another class, and this week I have two college tours+portfolio reviews bc fuck my school pic.twitter.com/Tu69XztcUP. If u thought galos proportions are unrealistic just know the figure drawing photo generator I use showed me a man with the closest thing I could imagine. He’s super buff but looks like u could snap him in the middle. Anyway it’s three in the morning so I’m posting this will delete when I have better judgement in the morning / noon pic.twitter.com/b0GPGa2UEi. They totally do, I’ve seen it! I even have a class this semester where ALL work /has to be square/ because /Instagram/ ..it’s interesting to think of how these things impact what work is created, or at the very least how it’s presented to an audience when it’s finished. (Softly) sorry to be stupid but what is this?? Illustration is GORGEOUS. OH . they key is to rotate emojis. Thanks . bby is feeling out of the loop u nu. An impossible question but here goes: A2, B1, B5, D1. me: i'm gonna do some homework
me, a full hour and a half later, having started absolutely nothing: uhhhh ..duhhhh. (Shouts from the rooftops) Duraclear ultra matte is so matte!!!

I can’t even barely tell I coated these things that were painted with gouache it’s lovely!! Gouache bleeds a little bc of course it does but if u do one quick light coating then u can do more coats w/o worry!  no way!! Good job!!! . Going for an informal portfolio review and tour at a diff school today . Hello I’m from here but please explain this joke to me?? pic.twitter.com/6EJi3JTRjI. I HAVE NO IDEA. Thank you! Mmmmmm ok that was quick and uninformative and now I’ve got. Two hours to kill. And I’ve completely lost my mother somewhere LMFAO. MassArt - contrary to popular belief, the Mass is for Massive. He said the print shop used to be a basketball court so I HAVE to see that. Pour one out for every artist taking preorders before the USPS annual rate increases but shipping afterward.

i'm sorry i don't make the rules. gorgeous!! dsfgdfh agreed -- i love him calling Galo chief too, but the warrant part really drives it home. lmfaoo this assignment -- in the printout theres text with a hyperlink, but in the one they uploaded online that text isn't there so you just
cannot get to the thing. reverse mood board: do whatever you want then try to justify it by finding images it could've been inspired by. don't you just wanna go /PHOTOREALISM/. my process is (throws things at wall) FUCK IT . Nsfw

I wrote nsfw but it’s not sexual it’s just like oh hey that’s a butt pic.twitter.com/91qD7wGN46. Aa I don’t have any of the dark purple so it won’t cover as well but I have enough stuff left to purple up my hair one more time!! Right now it’s washed out to a terrible gold/gray combo. Like hi what is this pic.twitter.com/FuTwENf9lz. Ahah I’m sorry to hear that   on a serious note tho I don’t think people really notice they probably just register “blonde-ish”. lrt if u commission them u better TIP. tfw when tickets are listed but impossible to purchase .. they’re like locked or smth . MHAHR My Hero Academia: Human Resources. Yeah :/ last time they were up earlier so I was checking. I got some locally for the dub but for sub I wanna go Boston, and the ones at the theater w the comfy seats are locked up   I’ll just have to keep checking!! I’m aiming for Fenway bc RECLINERS!! The common is nostalgic for Promare for me now but I love a comfy seat. ( I think the commons you can buy now but I’m not sure?). i dm u :O. This is so gorgeous.. No thank YOU for blessing my TL. Haha blessing..angels...get it. bro: this pool's gotta be 400ft..how long's our house? 150? 200 ft?
me: idk...
bro: how many steps is it?
me: (steps the entire length of the house) 27
bro: how big are your steps?
me: (measures) 2, 2 and a half?
bro: this pool is 6x the length of our house
me: that's TOO BIG. But the pool is so far away (Mexico). hello if you're an artist --- scratch that -- just anyone without a  contact button, form, page, email address -- ANYTHING on their website: wtf are you doing bro. you're right i'm sorry I was just being lazy, i'll get right on it. college tour round 2 part 2 tomorrow   I mean if I can go to school for free or only work study I could definitely be convinced for switch schools..I assume it’ll be hard to get into bc that’s guaranteed with our low income and it’s a Very Small school..  sounds yummy!! LRT Y’all. Lrt there’s ZERO DETAILS (shakes GKIDS) release date?? Preorder bonuses??? Hello??? Nothing like a fine arts focused school to make an illustrator feel like shit lmfaoo. The place was rad as hell, I like their philosophy and it was cozy and friendly but I was like oh she’s gonna hate all my ~~~commercial~~~ work and yeah. To be an intellectual sounds so exhausting. friendly reminder that I've got a birthday club that gets you 10% off your order and a doodle request! Very little info required~  https:// forms.gle/tTJdx4vfJLsjvX Hi7   …  
I'll be sending out the February one soon so you may wanna get on it! Shit I forgot to post my drawing but now I’m in bed so y’all will get it tomorrow. Lrt thank fuck, I need him rn. So many people sniffling and coughing on the train , exactly 0 face masks 

America: we’ll be racist about a virus but also will do nothing to protect ourselves or others from anything. My prof: you have to use black, white, and a color we picked randomly via lollipop preference (blue)

Also my prof: don’t use the colors just to use them. Dndndjsn so early in the semester and my spirit is so broken I’m aiming for Bs. LRT LMFAOO THAT SECOND PANEL I had to slam the RT button. ShnaNDNSJNDMD the second panel.. “pillow princess” comes to mind   their matching smiles are so precious. The options are crushing on you or trying to murder you 
Eat the croissant to find out. Yikes what year is it where these were designed . You’re too generous — I was gonna say 2005. . Fuck it, money’s a construct, I’m buying mozzarella sticks. My prof was like maybe instead of presenting here you can put it on your table (at the convention) and I’m like WOW THAT SOUNDS MUCH EASIER THANKS. LMFAOO 
Rosie: -never tweets again after this afternoon-
Me: -taking off my detective hat- guess we’ve got our answer. For my typography class we have to submit some examples of good or bad design we found in the wild and I was very pleased to have passed by my favorite example of poor design today pic.twitter.com/aACJdppKo6. in front of me at the store there was this girl she couldn’t have been older than 10 and she had a Coach bag and her dad was deadass buying her /$300/ of slime supplies and the lady goes “ohh are you having a birthday party?” And the guys like nah she just has friends over. Anyway I hope she grows up to appreciate things
I can’t imagine. Lrt gore. A modified version of this will (probably) be in a bigger project later but meanwhile — I drew a lil portrait of my friend and her kitty/my godson, Tip! If you like Lolita, cats, and the occasional Lum go follow:  http:// instagram.com/grimmfirefly   pic.twitter.com/9pcm0HskSH. this is gorgeous i wanna eat it. I don't draw cats often as you may have noticed and I'm honestly p happy w how this boy came out ; u;. amen . sometimes i have an /idea/ and wanna do /big projects/ with /deep meanings/. but most of the time i just wanna draw cute things on a whim. please just let me live. disco aisha, purple shoyru, or faerie kacheek? ; u;. definitely feeling the latter rn after this week's theme being ~~~~my voice~~~~. i think
i try to send valentines
within a week of today. been spending a lot of energy going back/forth btwn 'things that are just cute/fun/pretty still have value + if i'm interested in surface design then that's what i'd be making' and 'i have no ideas or critical thinking i'm not an intellectual or unique why would anyone hire me'. it's whiplash to be getting positive feedback from relevant folks abt surface design/commercial work then others are like hmm what if u did this deep thing Instead or u have a voice but it's soft..like i'm!! NOT A FINE ARTIST! I thought I knew that's okbut now i'm having a crisis. sorry for all this on main it's just been a hell of a week and not getting enough sleep like any of the past 5 days is really not helping!! ILL TRY TO BE LESS WUMPWAMP SOON. thanks friend u nu I know there are already people who appreciate my work, I don't mean to take that for granted either;; . ahaha thank you friend ..I felt pretty content in my soothing bears until this weeks events..I'm sure I'll get back there..I do like my work, I just am really susceptible to other peoples opinions+when I talk to people whose work is deeper or fine artists this is the result. GLAD TO HEAR IT <3. Ahaha I saw it on insta before and it’s in two parts there so I almost didn’t notice! Ahah it’s still under construction but some version of portraits of peeps and their pets . Even though I’m feeling down right now I definitely do agree with you!!  and I appreciate your input . Mint is rocking some luscious locks huh?! And I’m glad Zakuro got to glam it up. * U* OHH WHAT A BIG FISH!! THESE ARE SO PRECIOUS NINI. Graphic design is their passion . Also pizza. Cady decided to rub herself on smth gross so now I have to try to bathe her w warm water but outside bc she refuses to go upstairs let alone in the tub. hand lettering
i hate thee

i'm taking this class to improve on shit like this but also THIS IS THE FIRST ASSIGNMENT AND IM ALREADY STRUGLLING SOSDFGDFHBADLY. “Sometimes you make things that are just ok and that’s ok!!! Not everything need to be a masterpiece!!” - I scream into my own brain over and over. i have enough purple to dye my hair so im gonna do that i think itll make me happier 
i know that sounds stupid but i think y'all know what i'm talking about LOOK GOOD FEEL GOOD LMFAOO. lrt THATS WHAT I WAS THINKING TOO............the manga is so explicit about that too... I hope they treat his lil proof of character development moment well. hi are they official promare t-shirts that have just lio's eyes??? cause I can't find it but I thought I saw it for sure............ just a photo, not to buy. dfgdhfgd my bro is so precious I sent him my solid B grade piece and he was like Beautiful! Who did that? brain: wait til you get critique and post the finalized version in a few days
also my brain: POST IT NOW OR U ACCOMPLISHED NOTHING U FOOL. They make really cool interpretations too, it’s fun to see! Meis w bondage rope “Dallas” has me thinking about lassos . dog in the distance: bork!
cady: BORKBORKBORBKROBK
mom: cady, he wasn't talking to /you/, why do you think everyone's talking to you? My prof is crazy specific about what size, res, color mode, etc he wants for even the SKETCHES of this assignment, yet he didn’t set up a place to submit them and his dates are all incorrect . lrt retweeting because it's suddenly getting attention again today and hey I really like it still!! Holy shit thank u,,, I’ve been blessed. Class time
I am a nervous . Tndjdjdh this class is so intense we spent all four hours without work time again . I know it sucks to be forced to participate but pls I’m begging u don’t decide to be the fourth person to point out the same one problem,, I Got it already please . In other news I was like haha this guys quote is from Big Time Rush and it was actually POP/STARS and I’m shocked pikachu@myself for making the other associations first. "Do you feel the rush now?" - K/DA
"Don't you feel the rush?" - Big Time Rush. Hnnn. Wish I wasn’t having such a Time rn I wanna run Promare cosplay cafe...mostly to draw maid Lio and eat chocolate volcano cake but hey. Anyway I kept waking up in cold sweats so I turned the heat up and now I’m too hot to sleep someone please send help. Ahaha this is a good method I usually try but I had forgotten so thank you. It’s not happening so don’t cry . Me toodndndj. You (and I lol) running out of time!! If we are friends and or mutuals and u wanna Promare valentine fill this out ! https:// twitter.com/cambrasine/sta tus/1218767146186092544   …. Mmm i thought maybe I should chill today but I made what is hopefully a very doable to do list of several little things. Sounds like you need a change buddy   easier said than done I know. I was so productive for like two hours
And then I was so lazy for two hours . lrt i am not a dolphin. lrt this crosses my mind quite a bit..like just enjoying being with someone and then my brain is like 'will you even remember this moment?'. people designing and having ita bags manufactured is becoming more popular.. it's so wild to me bc there's so much construction that goes into it, samples must be insanely expensive, it's hard for me to imagine. aa my moms getting reached out to a lot now that she started her temp job LOL LIKE GOOD BUT HEY THAT TIMING ISNT HELPFUL where were y'all last month huh huhuhuh. LMFAOOO THIS IS SO BEAUTIFUL BUT I ALSO LAUGHED. forreal tho the textures on this...and the lighting..wowwowowow. subscribers may wanna check their inboxes~ u vu. Lmfaooo one of the subscribers emails bounced back and it is an intentionally fake address and it’s very funny like bro u voluntarily signed up??

Yeah that’s how I live my life. hi, can you read this?

I made changes to make it more legible (getting rid of most of the breaks in the letters, getting rid of the fwoop on the c so it doesn't look like an e, etc.) but i'm still not sure whether it reads easy enough or not .. pic.twitter.com/TcphRSKKjB. hnn i hear ya.. I'm trying my best over here HAHA
thank you for the feedback. LMFAOO I WAS GONNA SAY if anyone's gonna read 'loser' its' you ahah. thank you friend! maybe the c does need to be disconnected to look like it's not a flourish.. Not a full sentence but yes it does have a few words for context. Not sure if it’s enough tho so I’m trying a few things in case   I made an Instagram poll too that I’m curious for the results of. Hhhhhhhhhhhh. I had that and then my classmates said it looked like an e . YEAH AND THEN FOUR PEOPLE SAID THEY COULDNT READ IT LIKE BRO I HEARD YALL THE FIRST TIME . CURSEive. I did portray it literally, but figuratively this is about those moments when you stop + experience nature.

These are @halfaliveco  lyrics - GO LISTEN TO THEM! I adore still feel. + it’s meaning, but I decided to take this line out of context +reinterpret it [1/3] pic.twitter.com/NBx6fLZfvt. sometimes feel all-encompassing- are so unimportant in the grand scheme. Like feeling connected to the Earth+the universe is what truly matters. That's how I feel in those moments anyway. I'm sure many others feel the same, and  many don't! Free to interpret it how u wish [3/3]. [4/4] twitter did me dirty on this crop. anyway if u need a song about dissociating - but that is hopeful and an absolute JAM? I highly recommend: https://www. youtube.com/watch?v=KOOhPf MbuIQ   …. Anyway when I saw that shugo chara tape my brain shut down I wanna draw shugo chara so bad but I’m literally in bed already djdndn. THIS IS. SO CUTE. I’m sorry the project was cancelled, but this is adorable. shugo chara is more niche than some others but I’m sure there’s still lots of nostalgic fans!! . It was not my intention to deprive myself of several senses and sleep til 12:30 but it is what happened. That’s what happens when u live next to a construction site . Sjendjdj yeah I had really disrupted sleep until then (and the last two nights) so it was probably helpful. SHDNKFFM OH NOOO......that sucks. mood. LRT I HATE THIS GFDFHN. DSFGDG right in the kokoro. ASDGFDGH THANK YOU FRIEND!!!   I actually was thinking that - and my bro really liked it so I thought I would at least make one for him. Unfortunately I don't have access to the print studio rn but if that changes I'll hit you up ;). me, happy with my thumbnails: :)
me, remembering I still have to do 3 sketches, 3 "refined" sketches, and yknow finish a whole fucking thing: :(. Feel free to toss magical girl *animal companions* at me I’ve got kero, luna,  masha, and fucking kyubey (I haven’t watched madoka) 
I wish I could include shugo chara but uhhh it’s too weird to do an egg/guardian. Ohmygod he’s such a little shit tho iirc. But you’re not wrong...he’s not exactly the shape I need but maybe I can allude to him somewhere   thank you!! OH ! It’s cute . I love a Bear. .. UNUSUAL. AAC OG Location: 50 minutes away from me
AAC 2019: 20 minutes away
AAC 2020: 10 MINUTES AWAY 
AAC 2021: At my house?????????? YEAH like cool thanks but also LITERALLY WHY I had made peace with what I assumed to be a rejection this morning but then I Read it and now I’m like . Poll in replies!
PS Don’t get excited it’s just for an assignment  pic.twitter.com/mgeOr0F866. Pics in OP. ya ever just stuck between working on what you wanna work on and working on what you have to work on and as a result working on nothing. Same also damn ota 2 AM?! I had a dream where Promare was on toonami and also being put on as a play at like a local town theater. But the actor pretty much was /actually Galo/. The play was still bad tho. Also audience members were like raising their hands to ask him questions while he was trying to do a monologue and he was looking stressed but security people held them back 
and I was like yeah that sounds right. Constant mood. I do other draws to relax/treat myself when I’m having trouble w a drawing I /need/ to do and/or am struggling with, and I do get the relief of like hey look at that you can still draw but  I feel bad afterward that I didn’t spend that time on the things I needed to do instead. Oooooo according to that site you’re a “top notch vendor” now   (for real tho congrats!!!). me, yesterday: I'll just do a simple flat style :) quick, easy
me, today: uhhhHHHHHhHH pic.twitter.com/h5yAchVrUy. i'm crying i thought I'd get a B at best and I got a FUCKING 96 WHICH IS. GOOD BUT...now with the revision I already did..the most points I can gain is

3

LMFAOOO. the longer i work on this the more it looks like a lis*a frank. when I was shoveling I noticed bunny tracks going down the stairs, past the window to the room our bun is in

i wonder if they've got a romeo and juliet thing goin'.. I’m just laying awake in bed and suddenly I remember when, on the first day of an art history course, a classmate said Hajime Isayama (Attack on Titan) was their favorite artist. Anime birds
You’re welcome. It is a stupid time to nap but when has that ever stopped me before? yknow I was updating my site and the last like four big  illustrations I've done? I'm pretty happy with them?! It's not like I think they're perfect and I know how much struggle went into them, but compared to some of the older stuff next to them I'm like hell yeah jenn level up. i was like hmm maybe i'll take cady outside again and then it STARTED HAILING so uh pass. lrt i love lio's face here. Twitter was down for a sec but now I can share this very important science fact with you: 

It’s physically impossible to eat less than 3 mini Reese’s cups at a time, unless there are fewer than 3 remaining because you already ate so freaking many. It's too dangerous--- Legend has it if you eat only one or two you'll combust from the immeasurably large effort of self-restraint. omg... no I haven't tried those!! .....I'm like that w Reese's sticks and like 90% of places only sell it in king size DFGHGFJ Somehow it's easier not to buy it then to consume it responsibly . WOAH. That's next level restraint!! pic.twitter.com/T4KxLtrHHJ. hehe i bought my mom small valentines present. mom: I was the last one at work so yknow I put on a little Maggie Waters--
me: WHOMST. (the joke is Maggie Rogers - Falling Water). MICE AND AAC ARE THE SAME WEEKEND!!!!! that /SUCKS/!!! somehow I think I did about the same at both.. i'm deadass waiting to hear back from 7 cons rn 
but none drives me more insane than
home con
which is LIKE PRACTICALLY TWO MONTHS AWAY. FDGSHGFH don't get me started i could literally rant on about this forever. oh no i'm looking at their tweets from feb 4 i missed some drama apparently. i understand they're all volunteers but just
don't volunteer to do smth if you're gonna
do it
badly
like bro seriously I WILL DO IT please i'm begging. so my understanding from that shitstorm was around the 31st they sent out some number of acceptances, people have two weeks to pay and then /some period of time after those two weeks end/ they'll send another wave and so on until it's full, THEN send waitlist emails. but previously there's been 3+ weeks between waves so i'll expect my waitlist email on april 20th or what
(yes that's after the con). i just looked at twitter and AANI and I've seen evidence of exactly 5 people getting in. no way did they send out a full room of acceptances. i'm exhausted. seriously like we have to order in a /few weeks/ !!! esp where we have qck/zenkai a few weeks before like..combining would be NICE. hey hey I sent out customer review emails just now for a lot of dec/jan orders so if you have a sec fill it out?~ : ) no fields are required so it can be as quick as u want!! Thank you!! !!! CONGRATULATIONS!!   I'm sure it's a huge relief!! HOLY FUCK THE FIRST ONE. A little later than I wanted but I polished off my valentine drawing!! I made the labels already too!! still gotta print/cut/sign but!! I SEND ...SOON. UHh I tried to make the valentines 5x7 but apparently I drew it at 6x9??? so now they have to be 4x6 bc Proporitons. I’m screaming I asked my mom about that apple meme going around and she was like “what does it mean??! Tell me what it means!” when I tried to tell her I didn’t have an answer she, referring to the generic cartoon apple, was like “some people picture the apple logo?”And I lost it. Hdhdhdhd ITS A LITTLE LATE. I feel like I would look cute w my hair in victory rolls but I don’t have the skills to do it and I don’t have the motivation to learn . every single sculpt of Lio 

Designer: how’s this?
Supervisor: hmmm it’s good but ..what if he had a flame in his hand?  I’ll pour one out for you. LMFAOO I love him but I’ve never been really into properly scaled figures and it’s making me crazy bc I have to do a double take and can’t tell what’s new . Gorgeous . If y’all know any places or artists to get cute like pen and or paper clip holder type things from   drop some links/names here. hhhh I don't think I added bleed to this. sounds like a problem for LATER ME. anyway my twitter handle is on this assignment i'm turning in and i tweet here pretty indiscriminately so that'll be interesting. my classmates tomorrow, probably: wow she's so quiet i never would've guessed she wants to fuck so many anime characters. ahh yeah!! like to hold pens, paperclips, stickie notes, etc to make my mom's desk at her new work more homie :). lrt i wanna eat that palette yum. SORRY NO ONES VALENTINES GONNA B VERY SPECIAL BC I DON'T HAVE TIME sdfgf they'll be in the mailbox by tomorrow mornin. i haven't seen todays', feeling blessed :). ALL MY CUSTOMERS ARE WAY TOO NICE. me, an hour later, having doodled on at least three cards: Fuck. the real question is why am i more upset at them saying "woman" AEDGFDHJ. a few valentines have smth like this you’re welcome pic.twitter.com/gVJcWhgcD4. It’s been a rough couple weeks but at least my hair is purple again now pic.twitter.com/hic6XMRoSN. I searched for purple text on Insta and there were so many great options, here’s a masterpiece pic.twitter.com/e7TVrU3tCK. THAT ONE REALLY GOT ME. currently I'm stu(died). i'm genuinely concerned some well-meaning folks on instagram are gonna dm me like WOW YOU'RE SO TALENTED FOR YOUR AGE And I'll have to tell them I'm over double that. ok I think I messaged everyone who chose 'exchange' on the cards! lemme know if I missed ya!! I know everyone's busy/things come up so no worries if u don't send smth back, but if u do I will cherish it and add it to my little collection of cards and doodles from friends! . Aaa thankfully I slept better last night than I have in a full week..but not long enough so I’m still sleepy   hoping my worsened insomnia streak is over. Anyway I thought I was alone in the Panera bathroom so I said “don’t you dare go off while I’m in here, I’ll fucking k*ll you” to my buzzer. I was not alone. IM SO JEALOUS IM FOAMING AT THE MOUTH
ENJOY YOUR GOODIES My friend.  you’re too kind to me!! Take good care of the boys in the mean time   I’m sure you will haha. Damn we got assigned characters for this assignment by picking numbers and the girl right before me said what I was gonna say and got Finn and I feel ROBBED.  
And then it did start buzzing as I was washing my hands and it was crazy loud . anyway I’m now required for school to make Harry Potter fan art pls don’t@me . Ron. LMFAOOO. I’d ask to switch but I’m genuinely more afraid of getting smth idk or from some like adult swim program. I came in ready to pitch my poster and then I went last in critique which was at the end of class over time and I was like haha anime amirite guys. Woo! Ready to post this!

My 2nd design for illo assignment was to make an event poster - here's one for a hypothetical magical girl cosplay cafe! I CLEARLY WENT OVERBOARD!!!

I'll have this as a print for Zenkaikon - thinking of holographic or foil? Both?  Tell me what u think! pic.twitter.com/OQIuhUvdWl. Here's a version with all the text but to reiterate -- This is a FAKE poster for an assignment only (at the moment)! IT AIN't HAPPENING. At least not any time soon~ I know, I'm disappointed too ;P pic.twitter.com/N8vn2LIMcj. LMFAOO tbh you could show up here at any given moment and there probably would be some kind of cake, but not sakura themed LOL.  Thank you!! 
I think it would look cool holo, I just know it shows better on dark colors so I'm a little curious how visible it'd be. Aaa I tried organizing one a couple years back but unfortunately interest was too low to make it happen :( Maybe just need stronger advertising.. yeah!! I keep delaying the fb date just in case cause I wanna be able to inform everyone but..
hhhh Anime Boston's got their own maid café now I think? As of recently. People'd be too busy and tired to come to smth separate at the same time-- and I *try* to table in the AA;;. FUCK YEAH I FOUND MY OG NEOPETS ACCOUNT!! i've been trying to remember the username on and off for sooooo long

can't get in tho lol. Too stronk for your own good my friend. Anyway when driving down the main road last night we smelled a skunk and were like ugh phew and I think he fucking heard us cause a couple hours later it smelled so badly in our house and bro I just woke up and walked into the other room and it still smells . I’m sorry mr. skunk forgive meeeee.  if I ever put it in you’re super welcome my friend! I had a hard time getting enough interest in the past and now I’m Busy  orz. Y’all i think June 1st is the Promare release date for the UK, if it’s a diff distributor GKIDS prob has a different date for the US? Please correct me if I’m wrong I just can’t find a source saying the US date still. Yeah ok I stand by this. Alright insomnia has been m*rdering my ass lately but I am Up and I am going to Eat and Do Work bc I have to djdndnfn. Cady is barking at literally every car that comes down the street today...why. I'd just like to say thank you. I think I saw an article about this actually.. i was today years old when i found out this was christian rock https://www. youtube.com/watch?v=lt-FPt nyxvs   …. chill jam https://www. youtube.com/watch?v=CiiZHp gfdbc   …. i have a check in friday but i want to

> extremely limited funds
> prob can only use more expensive places w hard quantity + design limits bc of virus
I'M GONNA DO MY BEST
If any1 wants to order ahead (pay online without shipping costs to reserve then pick up at con) hmu. yeah...............I haven't asked my rep about it yet but I'm guessing it's probably a backlog nightmare over there so i'm just trying to plan ahead. i'm also wondering if the other places will have more orders than usual and longer turnarounds bc of peeps defecting to there too...... yeah.. I had good experiences w ink*it and chilly but the prices bite u in the ass for sure. i'm making myself some notes rn cause i'm like  "OK MOST POPULAR DESIGNS I'VE GOT... negative one.....four.....two...FUCK". ink*it too .,..I FORGOT ABOUT THAT...just as bad is the 70 layer file set up.......heLP. i'm making a little chart i'll send to u  when i'm done in case u need. Pretty good representation of my brain rn pic.twitter.com/FPfvgAnsiK. ....yeah sometimes it be like that. Yes   cloud poogle and striped kacheek! pic.twitter.com/UXXUJQeLjn. THESE LOOK FREAKING AMAZING. Somehow I missed seeing these before . The lovely @Giraffecosplay  . Lmfaooo I got an 8/10 for concept on my magical girl poster bc there’s “always room for improvement” bro why even go up to 10 then . Hdhdhdhd right? He’s a good teacher but that comment made me go :|. This post is such a mood. OHH I was so confused by my latest z*ap order update but it's bc I got a pin sample with it that it's with the 'construction team', which I had never heard of before ..... SOON y'ALL. for a second I was like WAIT...WHY WOULD THEY PUT THE STANDS TOGETHER :P. second time in two days I wrote litter instead of little . Y’all I saw someone post about a $50 laser printer to foul w the other day and I have   Best Buy credits that expire   I really wanna make hot pink foil prints but couldn’t find a place that reasonably does them above biz card size and   solution? **foil
I mean I have laser printers at my school but 1. Costs per print 2. Wildly inconvenient. bl*ick gift card.. grateful but it's so Cursed I haven't used it bc everything I ever want from them is 'online only' and I don't wanna pay for shipping.. I WANNA TRY .... FOILING ........ PUNCH NEEDLE.... RISO...

someone fund an artist residency for me except the residence is my home and in return for funding i just give u anime fan art in various mediums. $50 . My next question is: paper you can run through both inkjet and laser printers —— that exists??? I’ve seen it done but.. This is so gorgeous!!  I'm feeling inspired, but I was wondering what kind of paper you used that could go through both an inkjet and laser printer without issue? Sorry to be a bother!! . I fell asleep and my mom came in and woke me up and now she’s asleep in my bed and I’m awake and this is not what I wanted. Cool. pic.twitter.com/KQd7VconWt. Goodnight cow who jumped over the mom. Actual names of my inventory spreadsheets
Fall: Falcon Inventory
Spring: Springventory. (inhales deeply) ahh, nothing like a fresh spreadsheet that doesn't have discontinued designs and pre, sold, and post numbers for 3+ conventions. mom: what about these jenn, these are cute
me: .....those are.....lio fotia's snow boots..... pic.twitter.com/TAUBg7DPbW. i have some odd aversion to buying new snow boots even tho my feet have been wet for twO YeARS. link in case any of u weebs wants them

 https://www. dsw.com/en/us/product/ khombu-alexa-2-snow-boot/468146?activeColor=001   …. doodle Boy 4 u pic.twitter.com/O9BKLFgLO0. Stupid drawings for you, goodnight pic.twitter.com/eVLaZvSo03. One more

I hope most of my valentines arrive to people today bc I gotta post the drawing for tomorrow . I heard a couple east coasters got em ..hoping for all the US ones at least by tomorrow .. sorry international people . How dare you post this picture to personally attack me and remind me Ive been neglecting to glue my pins on for like a month now . (Being serious tho I am curious to see these lil guys  ). Aaa glad to hear they’re arriving quickly!! Heheeh   glad you got it safely and happy to make u blushy. The ICA really had my back w the tag color today  pic.twitter.com/WUrP2VbLoY. Aaa yeah I was thinking magnets would be cute too so then I got indecisive!!  I’ll look forward to it!! Do you know how much self restraint it required to not take this man home with me??? pic.twitter.com/AHJGrQOkEa. Stage stands and a sample for Secret project should be here Monday!! I’ll mail them out ASAP but there’s a good number of orders and lots of pieces for each so it may take me a few days!  why would you say thatttt???

Nah he’s got some other animal friends there though. I’ll look forward to it!! . Long long man. pic.twitter.com/MSn1yKtCNe. Yyyeesss. Have fun!! I did the same shit w that fic this morning!! THAT ENDING DID NOT LEAVE ME READY TO START THE DAY. /SLAMS REFRESH. Nsfw / Anyway usually the top listings on my et*sy homepage are things I just looked at — and there ARE those things I looked at — like Promare merch — below these but — but uh. What the fuck are these? I’m very concerned. pic.twitter.com/vGzUClr4z4. I cannot imagine using these in such a way just say hey wanna bang it’s easier and cheaper. ITS LIKE the candle is saying LETS FUCK yet you censor a word ?? Yeah this is a “the straights are at it again” moment for sure. BIG OH NO. The only solution is a $12 artisan candle. Or like u take care of it yourself or change ur mind and the other person comes in and sees melted wax and they’re like FUCK I MISSED MY WINDOW . Oh no I remember seeing this before....please just talk to each other..learn to ask for what you want and also to take no for an answer. Getting up....ghhhhhhgvbbbb. This feels like a good song for those post-movie angst Galo Lio fics where they have trouble getting together or feel purposeless or re:Kray, etc  https:// m.youtube.com/watch?v=nt4_p9 Pz0RI&list=RDxJxcOrFrSDQ&index=20   …  also it’s a good song in general so. Cut to me having a heavy internal struggle about buying my mom $17-25 flowers LMFAOO I decided against it bc moneys really tight but I got her favorite donut and hopefully the other little thing I got in the mail comes today . Zine / indie comic fest. LRT LMFAOOOO. My check in meeting for my project went well. I’m surprised but happy I was able to sleep last night...anyway time to relax for (checks calendar) not at all. Omg this is such a sad tweet. Lio made a heart-shaped pizza - just for you! (And also for Galo !)  

Hopefully most of my valentines have received their postcards - I want to share this with y'all! If you want one for yourself, head to  http:// cambrasine.art/shop-all     pic.twitter.com/Phg0jbnrYz. LMFAOOO I think you made the right choice then my friend   it’s not “dicks out” but it may raise some questions. Obviously Galo wants margherita mega max but I would make Lio the mac n cheese pizza he deserves ..damn now I want pizza. Imagine not being local. Galo is living the dream I see pic.twitter.com/SXFiN916L3. One year I’ll see y’all at katsu but this year isn’t that year (burritos myself in a blanket) im just chillin

Have fun, make bank, stay safe, stay warm!! My mom was like oh no I lost a glove and I was like bro u are..u are wearing it. I just realized you have to assemble these by hand and I am so sorry. I wish these tweets weren’t locked. N-neither? The person at the deli cuts it.

fuck those single slice packages tho. Casually sketches out another four panel comic I’ll never draw. Ok this comic is very funny I think. LRT THIS IS SO FUCKING CUTE. This is the cutest thing ever! I love this idea . i'm so confused trying to order for zenkai*kon cause i feel like certain items have gotten a lot less popular/i wanna discontinue but I don't feel like I've made enough new items to replace them and I ? need to have things to sell so LOL. SDFGFDH NO IT IS STILL FUNNY I laughed out loud...it is also just so relatable. AA IM SO JEALOUS!! GLAD U HAD AN AMAZING TIME!! HNNN I SAW WAY BACK WHEN U WERE LIKE HAHA ANY FRIENDS LIKE BANDS And I was like damn I like BANDS but yeah. hopefully bank accounts will bounce back and we can go to some rad concerts sometime!! I was also listening to florence + the machine earlier today and i was like HEY U SAW THEM. Lmfaoo “oh my —-yes of-of course you can buy two but —- I’m gonna need about 45 minutes”. IM MAKING THIS STUPID FUCKING COMIC IT'S GONNA take forever but maybe it'll be ready soon it's valentine's day forever for this to work ok?? Oooo I could see this one like a long pencil poiuch too. Happy valentine ,, I got myself cheap color safe shampoo and a $3 chocolate bar live your best life. LRT Zambis Art is so cute!!! Go support!!! Help kitty!!!!!!!!! Sending you and kitty love!!! . Aaa yeah i try to keep my eyes out but I’m kinda bad at it!! . My friend is coming tomorrow instead so now I have to work on stupid Ron Weasley cereal for school hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. HUFf. HUFF. I fIANLLY AM GONNA. spend my blick giftcard ..well, most of it..IDK WHY THIS IS CAUSING ME SO MUCH ANXIETY????? what is happeininggdsfg. yes. i have no control over this assignment. I’m so excited at the prospect of being able to make foil prints on my own   I hope it works out well!! Idk why I tend to have bad luck(/bad skills?) when it comes to crafting ..i think the only thing that could be troublesome is the alignment for certain designs  but we’ll see. the cheap printer i got w credits only goes to 8.5x11 so i can only do medium/minis but if it works well it could be so cute I could like,, even put text on designs in foil like if someone wanted something customized or smth....casually slaps reunion will come on no.6 print LOL. there's two wolves inside of my one is obligatory harry potter cereal assignment and the other is belated valentine's galolio comic. i
'm rooting for you. I can’t believe it’s only 10 I’ve been forcing myself to work on this it feels like it’s been years. It is like pulling teeth but I am doing it 
I had to remind myself of 8 books full of lore pic.twitter.com/0QIb0B0Z3R. nsfw / Some really unfortunate "~sexy~" candles showed up in my E*tsy recs the other day and it was physically impossible for me to not make it into a galolio comic

Please enjoy pic.twitter.com/8kFZoZe9Sx. I have no self control. SDEGDTHRFGHvd this made me laugh thank you. FDSGFHT THANK YOU FRIEND!! (Hope you're having a good katsu btw!!). I was laying awake in bed thinking of making this comic the other night and when I thought of 'gag gift' I pretty much lost it. Point is, galolio fucks happy belated Valentine’s Day. HSBDHDNCN MY MOM IS GETTING RID OF OLD GREETING CARDS OK and she goes “I don’t know what I was thinking when I bought this card (for you) ...’delightful’ and ‘lovely’ aren’t exactly the words I’d use to describe you”
And I FUXKINFNFMDNXC FB. She just meant they seemed weirdly impersonal but Ohmygod that was such a Burn. MILO!!!  YOURE WAY TOO KIND!!! !! AAAA I’m so glad it reached you in time! DSGDH GFH SERIOUSLY YOU'RE TOO SWEEET!! I'm glad you liked it so much!! omg so it didn't make it in time after all huh--   BUT PRETTY CLOSE !! I'm so glad we can share our mutual love of ,, LIO FOTIA . OU/ch. Bank: is this charge valid? Reply Y or N
Me: Y
Bank: We can’t understand you, call us
Me: y’all. you’re welcome!!  I’m glad you enjoyed it~~.  heheh thank you!!  thank you! When I ordered dessert tonight the employee asked for my name for the order and I said “Jennie” and @grimmfirefly  goes smth like “Thats not your real name” And IT WAS FUCKING FUNNY but also omg why, I thought we were FRIENDS !! 

Anyway I’d highly recommend this harmless prank. He was very friendly too so it turned into a whole thing and she hassled me again when I went to pick it up from him djdbdhs. “LOOK IT EVEN SAYS JENNIFER ON MY CREDIT CARD” - me, desperate for redemption. Wow!! I’m glad you sold so many!! My brain literally refuses to process this. My mom gets up to all sorts of shenanigans if I go to bed early like she woke me up right at the start for my computer password to print +now I’m looking and she tried to reset the password on one of my email accounts — the spam one — like what were u possibly trying to do buddy. Ily but u need Supervision pic.twitter.com/6qJV9iZLLD. Trying to picture Lios face re: This. Perfect . my prof didn't slacked on details this week and didn't answer my q so he's getting what he gets . shit happens that's cool but I also can only do so much w the info I have yknow. me turning in work I know is bad
It’s only process stuff but still GUHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh pls give me direction dude cause I’m confused and unmotivated. Stage standees have arrived and I am DROWNING IN ACRYLIC!! I’m gonna do my best to get these out ASAP but there’s a good chunk of orders and 5 pieces min. per so it’s going to take some time!!! You’ll receive a tracking number when yours goes out!  will keep ya poster here pic.twitter.com/GkGOGvb0xN. Also you’re gonna have to peel them!! It’ll keep them better protected while they’re shipped and also it’ll take you like 1 minute to do just yours or it’d take me an hour to do all of them . Out of curiosity I clicked on an asmr video where “rich girl spoils you” and uh apparently that— that’s what I want. SHE ACTS SO CUTESY I’m like uhh she has a crush on me ? and the comments all say it too   

ok back to real life!! Back to work!! Unfortunately!!! If you want to feel like a rich girl has a crush on u watch Ocean*s ASMR - the Christmas one is the one that feels Gay but the first one is just fucking funny she’s like “yeah my dad like invented dogs or something so that was pretty big and I think he’s the CEO of google?”. Oops I just made a reply by its Oceans ASMR ! There’s two but the Christmas one is the one that you’re like oh maybe she /likes/ me . I did not realize this was The Fantasy before today but I have seen the light. ITS FEBRUARY WHY DID NO ONE TELL ME MY THANK YOU NOTES STILL SAY HAPPY HOLIDAYS FGDDFHFGFg.
