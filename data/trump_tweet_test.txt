Congratulations to Jim Herman, my ass't golf pro at Trump Nat'l Golf Club/Bedminster, NJ for qualifying for the U.S. Open! @usopengolf. Does anyone else have two golf pros—John Nieporte & Jim Herman—who qualified for the U.S. Open?  Could this be an all-time record? The two dumbest interviews in history may go down as Lance Armstrong, who is being sued by everyone in the world, & Michael Douglas. @ happyloner    Wrong you idiot! @ arid93   They should have stopped paying him a long time ago. @ charleyUfarley    Innocent of what, weren't they brutally mugging people in the Park that night?

I will be going to Aberdeen, Scotland today to help my team celebrate the great success of Trump International Golf Links-press conference. My son @EricTrump  has just done another great event and raised a lot of money for @StJude . He is a really good boy who loves helping kids. Thanks to @johnrich  for putting on such a great concert fot @Stjude . John was a winner on Celebrity Apprentice and is a fantastic guy. According to Bill O'Reilly, 80% of all the shootings in New York City are blacks-if you add Hispanics, that figure goes to 98%. 1% white. Sadly, the overwhelming amount of violent crime in our major cities is committed by blacks and hispanics-a tough subject-must be discussed. When it comes to violent crime, and if we are going to solve the problem, we must stop being so politically correct-must tell it like it is! Likewise, the primary victims of violent crimes are in the African American and Hispanic communities. These people want LAW AND ORDER now! "@dblsolo700: @zed_crtr @realDonaldTrump  ASK HIM ABOUT #CP5  CENTRAL PARK 5"  Yea, ask me about the muggers! @dblsolo700  Not concerned about them-weren't they brutally mugging people in the Park?

We need to stop trying to be so politically correct.". @ go_onrob    The show is a joke in comparison to the original Apprentice, but it does pay me a lot of money. I can't believe the Yankees continue to pay A Rod - they have a perfect right to stop paying (and should have stopped a long time ago). George Steinbrenner would have done a major number on A Rod - there is no way he would have gotten paid, even with the help of the union!

John Kerry is openly celebrating the tenuous nuclear deal with Iran. Great dealmakers do not celebrate deals,they just go on to the next one.

Realize that being an entrepreneur is not a group effort. You're in charge--everything starts with you. Did you ever not do something that had you done it would have turned out to be a disaster.

Entrepreneurs are visionaries in some respects--they look beyond the present. Keep that in mind when looking for opportunities. "Thinking big is the driving force that has forged all the great achievements in modern life." - Think Big. It's Jan. 2. President Obama should end his vacation early & get back to Washington to straighten out the ObamaCare catastrophe--or end it. Snowden should come back to America and face justice. Instead, he is begging for clemency from Moscow. Treat him as a spy. “Invincibility lies in the defence; the possibility of victory in the attack.” - Sun Tzu. I know of no more encouraging fact than the unquestionable ability of man to elevate his life by conscious endeavor.

Congratulations to @BretBaier  on his five year anniversary as the anchor @SpecialReport . Brett is great! "Stay confident even when something bad happens. It is just a bump in the road. It will pass." - Think Big. Achievers move forward at all times. Don't tread water. Get out there and go for it. Remember to think big by expanding your horizons at the same time you're expanding your net worth. Identify your goals. Know precisely what you want to achieve, study the best people in your field,and then plan the best route for success. Please, @21Club , go back to your original menu and preparation. Believe me, it was much better. Let me know when the change is made! While I am a critic of President Obama, I hate it when someone (Robert Gates) writes a self serving negative book about his boss.

"@BrownsMakeMeUgh: It's very important that he fills out his March Madness bracket on SportsCenter while Putin takes over eastern Europe". "@Chris_LaPenta : @realDonaldTrump  That's why we need you in 2016.". Plane was carrying those terrible lithium ion batteries, which are highly combustible, as cargo. Fire could have started in cockpit. Lithium ion batteries should  not be allowed to be used in aircraft. I won't fly on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner - it uses those batteries. Looks like plane may have been found in the Indian Ocean off the coast of Australia. "@CheezitsCat: .@realDonaldTrump  what is ur favorite plane?"  Boeing 757 and Citation X.

"Things turn out best for the people who make the best of the way things turn out."  --  John Wooden. "Failure is simply the opportunity to begin again, this time more intelligently." -- Henry Ford. President Obama was able to fool the Americans by getting elected, but not able to fool Vladimir Putin. Too bad for us! We're spending a fortune looking for the lost plane with mostly Chinese passengers, and that's OK-but how much are Russia & China spending? I don't hate Obama at all, I just think he is an absolutely terrible president, maybe the worst in our history! While Putin is scheming and beaming on how to take over the World, President Obama is watching March Madness (basketball)! President Obama, be cool, be smart, be sharp and FOCUS (no more March Madness), and you can beat Putin at his own game. IT CAN BE DONE! "Continuous effort - not strength or intelligence - is the key to unlocking our potential."  -- Winston Churchill. Great advice from my father: "Know everything you can about what you're doing." -- Fred C. Trump. Great advice from my mother: “Trust in God and be true to yourself.” – Mary MacLeod Trump. Putin has become a big hero in Russia with an all time high popularity. Obama, on the other hand, has fallen to his lowest ever numbers. SAD. I believe Putin will continue to re-build the Russian Empire. He has zero respect for Obama or the U.S.! We should be building up our military and our missile defense systems to their highest levels ever. Must be very strong to prosper & survive. The situation with Russia is much more dangerous than most people may think - and could lead to World War III. WE NEED GREAT LEADERSHIP FAST. Obama must now FOCUS, get his mind off "March.Madness", and LEAD! Watch Russia closely, work hard on the economy and get rid of ObamaCare! I wonder if Apple is upset with me for hounding them to produce a large screen iPhone. I hear they will be doing it soon—long overdue. Obama should stop running down the stairs when getting off Air Force One.  Doesn’t look presidential and at some point he will take a fall.

Here's some advice for public speaking: "Be sincere; be brief; be seated."  F.D. Roosevelt. Robert Slater, who just passed away, was a terrific writer who wrote a very fair book about me. He will be missed. http:// bit.ly/1jDBTPO  . "He that is good for making excuses is seldom good for anything else." --
Benjamin Franklin. President Obama looks absolutely exhausted in the Netherlands. He is not a natural leader, was never ment to lead - it is tough work for him. Not good or smart for Obama to be calling Russia a "regional" power or to mention the concept of a nuclear weapon going off in NYC. This is the time for the United States to be strengthening all important military components - not rolling over and dealing from weakness! "@wesbart53: Watched his speech yesterday...pathetic. Carter-esque, weak. His delivery is so cautious not to offend, absolutely zero"  True! By Obama mentioning Manhattan yesterday in his response, he has singlehandedly made it target #1. How totally stupid is this guy? If you’ve looked over the years,I’ve been right on virtually every issue from Iraq (not going in but if so taking the oil) to jobs to China. Some great quotes from the legendary and courageous Winston Churchill: "Never, never, never give up." ... "You have enemies? Good.

"Inspiration exists, but it has to find us working."  -- Pablo Picasso. "@SamJabbo   @realDonaldTrump  i haven't read any of your books yet, which one should i start with?" The Art of the Deal is a good start. For Entrepreneurs: A good question to ask yourself –“What can I provide that does not yet exist?”. Entrepreneurs:  Another question to ask yourself—“What am I pretending not to see?” There may be great opportunities right around you. Entrepreneurs:  Believe in yourself. If you don’t, no one else will either. Realize that becoming an entrepreneur is not a group effort. "@realMikePalumbo   Walked in Trump Tower for the first time this week.. Gorgeous (as all your work). Love the Trump experience"  Thank you. "@HrvstFoundation  @realDonaldTrump  @SamJabbo  The Art of the Deal gets my vote. It changed the way I do business." Great! To all young (and old) entrepreneurs: Believe in yourself, talk yourself up! Energize yourself and you'll energize others. To all haters and losers: I am NOT anti-vaccine, but I am against shooting massive doses into tiny children. Spread shots out over time. @PrincessDaytura @realDonaldTrump  for president - it's reality, he is reality and he is the ONLY one capable of making the necessary changes. .@ArsenioHall  - The only thing you don't mention in the nice Esquire piece about you is The Apprentice, without which you would be nowhere! .@ArsenioHall  - How quickly people forget, but not me!
